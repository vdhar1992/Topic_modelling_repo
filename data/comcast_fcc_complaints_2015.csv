0,"I have been contacting Comcast Internet Technical Support for the last 12 months to resolve slow Internet Speed issues with no permanent resolution. They have also sent Techs to my residence and replaced Hardware.
 I pay an additional monthly fee for these services and have not received them. When I speak to management they are very arrogant and rude. Their tone is demeaning and unapologetic. A resolution to my problem is never reached. Most of the time I get hung up on or experience long hold times.
 My complaint is that I have been paying for services that I am not receiving. I pay for High Speed Internet, Boost Internet Speeds, Reliable Service and Acceptable Technical Support and I do not receive any of the above. I feel like I have been duped into paying for these services without actually receiving them. I can accurately say that for the last 12 months I have paid $60 a month for High Speed Internet and have not received anything remotely close to High Speed Internet. Every time I have contacted Comcast I have made it extremely clear that I am not receiving the services I am paying for and Comcast continues to bill me for the services I am not receiving.

1,"Back in January 2015 I made 2 payments: One for January's service and one for February's service (advance payment). In March I go to the web page to make my payment and I see that my account shows past due. I call Comcast to find out where my payment went since it was deducted from my bank account. I offered them to send a copy of my bank statement. They did not seem to care about that. They give me a confirmation number for the investigation and they promise to call me back. Not only they did not call me back but they turned off my service. I called again and they gave me another confirmation number of the same investigation. They promised to restore my service while the investigation is completed. My service is still off. I had to call me bank and start another investigation. Comcast does not seem to care at all. Are they committing FRAUD with their customer's money?

2,"Our home is located at in Acworth Georgia 30101. We signed a one year contract with Comcast / Xfinity for high speed internet service starting on July 2014. The account number is . The base rate is $39.99 billed monthly. I am sending this compliant on behalf of my partner/husband Mr. . who’s name is on the contact.
 The service agreement was for high speed internet only at the speed of 50Mbps. On average the internet speed is half of the promised agreement at our location. The service for the past month has become much slower in the ranges of 5 to 15Mbps. We placed a service call on 04/018/2015 and was given 4 appointment times after repeated calls. Each appointment was missed and no one showed up to investigate the problem. While on the phone with each CSR (customer service rep) they would review the inbound service line remotely to “clear” the line. This has been done several times prior to this date over the past year. Our service will go out and drop for several hours at a time, especially on Sunday evenings. I contacted the CSR again around 7PM EST on 04/01/2015 to complain about the lack of service and to get a confirmed service appointment. Finally after being on the phone for 30 minutes and the CSR was very helpful. He cleared the line and the speed came up to around 25Mbps but not to a full speed as the contract has promised. A tech come out on Thursday 04/02/2015 and replaced couplers inside and outside that were not properly installed. The technician stated “the hardware in the outside boxes needed repair and updated.” The outside units that provide service to our home are outdated and never was updated. He stated this is the reason we are only getting less than half of the speed in our home. He placed a service request for someone to come out on Friday 04/03/2015. No one has showed up and no one has followed up with us regarding this issue.
 Today is 04/18/2015 and our internet speed is only at 17Mbps download and 11.99Mbps upload. I have attached a screen print of the speed test via their website. I am asking that every service line and box be updated and repaired in our neighborhood. Also since Comcast / Xfinity has failed to provide the contracted service for almost 10 months. We are asking for a full refund of our service agreement and demand 1 full year of service at no cost. This lack of service must stop or we will seek additional legal advice and resources.

3,"Comcast in the Atlanta area has just put into effect an unprecendented usage cap of 300GB. If you
 exceed this cap, you are charged an extra $10 per 50GB. If you stream from online services in
 standard HD, you can hit this cap extremely easily. Comcast has never capped usage before this
 year and before the new net neutrality rules went into effect. I feel their practices are unfair as there is
 no competition in the Atlanta market. They can treat their customers however they choose and it's not
 right."
4,"I have been a customer of Comcast of some sort for 20 years now and have never had issues like I
 am having now and the past 4 years.
 For the past 4 years I have had issue with my internet service with them. And every time I call I seem
 to get the run around. Their customer no service apparently has no way to contact their techs that
 come out on site. Any way to the problem at hand. My connection goes up and down constantly over
 and over again and has been for nearly 4 years at least and the past year it has gotten worse. The
 odd thing is that prior to a few months ago when it went down was between the hours of 10 am and 6
 pm eastern Monday thru Friday. The weekends it seemed to be fine no issues but I work from home
 a great deal and I need my connection up and running Monday thru Friday and being an on call Tech
 Support person myself I need this up and running at all times. Every time I call it seems to be the
 same story over and over again power cycle your modem which of course this has already been
 done. I have been told to go swap out my modem I believe at least 5 times the past year. I do and
 same issues. They send a tech out and I get told its my splitters that they provided so they re do
 them and what not and of course my connection works for a few days or even weeks but then issues
 start up once again. This time however my connection drops totally and has been down 3 days now.
 I called Sunday evening when it first went down and was informed someone would be out within the
 day, whatever that means so I had to clarify within 24 hours. I was given a ticket number this time
 which I usually don't get. I was told at 12:33 pm the next day I would get a call from the technician
 coming out or their department. The person specifically stated 12:33 pm I would get a call. So did I
 no I didn't I waited another 20 minutes then called and referenced my ticket number and was told it
 was closed. So of course this made me furious the tech opened a new ticket then again was told
 someone would be out within the day. I informed them that wasn't good enough. Then I was given a
 time of 3 to 5 pm the same day someone would be out. Of course this did not happen either. So I
 called again around 4 pm and told my story once again. This time I requested to speak to a
 supervisor and was informed no one was available. Then after being hung up on several times while
 waiting on a supervisor I was finally told that they were all in a meeting and one will call me back. Of
 course this never happened either. Knowing that I needed my connection back up they set me an
 appointment up for the following Thursday I informed them that wouldn't work then they gave me a
 time of 8 am to 8 pm someone would be out. So now once again I will have to waste my whole day
 waiting on someone and I have a strong feeling they will not show as it is now 1:20 pm and have still
 not received a call back.
 My wife and I are moving in a month have are now going with their competition in that area. The
 competition if they were able to come to my current area informed me they would be pleased to come
 out this afternoon and install everything. But unfortunately they are no longer adding more DSL
 customers in my area as their other option is still rolling out with new infrastructure at this time."
5,"To whom it may concern:
 I am a Comcast customer in the metro Atlanta area. This area is a test area for overage charges for using too much data with Comcast. This past month I was informed that I had reached this arbitrary limit on my data usage of 300 GB per month. They told me I could use more data, but it would cost $10.00 per 50 GB of data.
 I believe that this is unjust as we are using our internet connection for streaming TV shows and movies because we do not subscribe to cable. Comcast is in essence punishing us for not having a pay TV subscription with them.
 There was no limit before and now they are trying to slowly impose one and we are sadly the first pawns in the chess set to be taken down by Comcast's arbitrary data limits and per GB fees.

6,"Good morning,
 Comcast has been throttling my internet speed for years. I understand that the offer is for up to 50 gigabits but there have been times where 1 device connected to the modem would speedtest ookla (which comcast has fast tracked) to .0125 gigabits per second.
 When I called comcast on the issue they said ""I have taken away the bad internet. Good bye."" and hung up on me this has happened to me multiple times during WWE PPVs through the WWE network. It was unwatchable. I missed special events because comcast, I believe, would rather have me purchase it through them.
 More recently, I have been having issues when online gaming. I have a router that tracks modem speeds and it seems to drop to 5-10 megabits per second during peek hours (after dinner and before bed).
 Whenever I hear a radio ad where they brag about their speeds being 10 times faster than dial-up I laugh.
 I feel like I'm being punished for having a 5-star Comcast approved modem and not renting one of their modems or switching to business class. Or maybe it's because we cut the cable television.
 Speaking of throttling, I suppose the best part is I can never get full quality netflix. Now, this sounds bad but with the unreasonable data cap of 300 gigabytes if I received my full speed I would have 66.66666 (repeating of course) hours a month to use it.
 My family is reliant on the internet. After work I sometimes stream games with my buddy. My wife watches Netflix in her free time. My son LOVES Youtube minecraft videos and has his friends over to watch videos. If we got full speeds on Netflix, we'd be in trouble.
 If I were to buy a new AAA PC game on steam, I would use 1/6th of my data cap to download something I have just paid $60 dollar on.
 In short, the ""test market"" of implemented data caps is a cash grab. I would expect if that were to be implemented the cost of going from unlimited to 300 megabytes would be lowered. There was no price drop.

7,"When I moved to Michigan I contacted Comcast regarding internet service and was told several times that the internet package I was interested in would be perfect for my gaming needs. I specifically asked about port forwarding and hosting small gaming servers on my laptop. They assured me that this was possible with their service at my location.
 I have never been able to do this. I have contact customer services 3 times. Each instance of seeking help lasted for several days before I was worn down by them and gave up. Each instance spanned dozens of phone calls and hours of web chat.
 Port forwarding consists of allowing outside computers to access your computer directly. This is absolutely vital if you with to play with friends.
 Hosting of servers does not involve an actual specialized server computer, but instead a small instance of a specialized program published by the game's developer. This is a very common practice and is vital for playing many games.
 I have never had a problem running these programs until I moved to this location. I have tried everything. New routers, different computers, etc.
 I have contacted Comcast about this seeking help many times. Each time they run through their script, and after at least an hour escalate me to more proficient tech support. At this level they tell me I need new equipment, that it should be working, or, more frequently, that if I would only upgrade my service, I would be able to successfully port forward and have friends connect to my computer. Over and over I have spent hours with them, only to be told that for more money each month the service I was promised from the get-go would be available.
 I believe that I was lied to when I was assured that I could port forward from this location, and if I had been told the truth, I would not have signed a contract with them.

8,"Comcast Xfinity cable service was interrupted May 30 at 9:09 PM PT for over 20 minutes and hold times for Comcast customer service was over 10 minutes. Again today cable service is interrupted at 8:30 PM PT and customers service hold times by Comcast's stated automated estimate is over 1 hour 30 minutes and Comcast's stated estimate is that service is not expected to be restored until 11:16 PM PT - 2:44 minutes later -- the full extent of my evening free time. Additionally internet service is degraded as well (by Comcast's own report).
 I do not pay Comcast for service for when it is convenient for them to deliver service, but for when I want it and need to use it which is primarily in the evening. This is unacceptable and assuming I ever get to speak to a Comcast representative (I am currently still on hold), I will be asking for a partial refund for failure to deliver contracted services.

10,"I went into the Comcast/Xfinity office at 4800 Cutler on the 19th of January, and turned in my cable tuner and told them I wanted to disconnect my services. Specifically, when entering my information into the tablet at the front of the store, it asked if i was there to disconnect services. I selected 'yes'. Then when dealing with the customer service rep, I told her I was returning my equipment to disconnect my account. I also asked her about my final bill, and she told me it would be sent through the normal billing. A few weeks later I got a call that the account was past due, and have been dealing with them not disconnecting the account as asked since.

Also, this is a problem that reoccurs every day which interferes with my ability to do work and watch TV. I should not be calling my cable company more than my wife.

17,"Four months ago, I moved to a new apartment within the same building. At the time that I moved, I had a credit on my account with Comcast for about $65 (because I was up-to-date on my payments and moved out partway through a billing cycle). Comcast has NEVER applied the credit to my new account or sent me a check even though I have spoken when at least ten agents regarding this issue (and have been promised every time that I would be credited the amount I am owed). To matters worse, I recently began getting automated phone calls from a third party working on behalf of Comcast stating that I never returned the equipment from my old apartment. I NEVER had any equipment from them; I own my own modem. The third-party company has no option to speak to a live agent so I have no way of telling them that there was no equipment in the first place. I have contacted Comcast at least 10 times regarding these issues but the calls have not stopped. I am still owed the $65 and I am still getting harassed with daily phone calls about returning equipment I never had in the first place. I will sue Comcast if this goes on for much longer.

The most I can get is 70 MB per second, unfortunately this happens only once or twice per month or is an unusual spike in that last for a minute. The reality and average speed is about 50 MB per second, which is at least half of what I am being billed for. This also does not take into account the biweekly issues we have of signal drops, which when called to fix they state that its a signal node issue and that no one else has complained about or that the weather has affected my signal (currently I reside in the Washington DC metro area).

They will not comp the service for more than a day here or there because they have no concern about the amount of lost productivity I experience due to the lack of Internet not do they care about the amount of time that my wife and I spend waiting for them to show up with a different tech who also can not find s permanent solution.
 This abject lack of concern for the client or the quality of service is made possible by YOU allowing them to be a virtual monopoly in our town.

21,"I would like to file a complaint on comcast also known as Xfinity. I have had service with them since December 2014. Due to my building needing wires repaired, my service never worked or worked once a week only for a few hours. I was able to use the Internet sometimes. I've made several attempts to have a tech come out to service my cable/internet/phone. Which they either never showed up or canceled my appointment without my acknowledgement and later say they will give me a credit for that. I've reached out to managers and area directors via email still no actions or a email response back.
 Finally after complaining every other day or week ""5 months later"" I was able to get a tech/techs to come out and replace all wiring in the building since my whole building was out of service and they told us all we are still responsible for our bill. My complaint is. .. I was told on April 24th 2015 that I would receive a credit on my account for a total of $494.63 for all of the months I was out of cable. That is still not the full amount of cable which I pay for each month. My account is always past due because I was told once I pay it in full the credit will be posted to my account and that has yet to happen. I called today June 7 2015 on behalf of the credit so I could pay the remainder which would be $50-ish and spoke with a agent by the name of Jason, his attitude alone was my breaking point. He told me he will not transfer me to a manager because they will tell me the same thing and my credit was denied because i was still able to use my some time-ish internet.
 Please something has to be done. This company knows they have no other competition and feels they could treat their customers any kind of way especially if they are in a contract, such as myself. Any suggestions? I'm not the only consumer complaining about this company. I bet if your company fined them $1000 each complaint the service would be so much better. Please help us. ... end the contracts to sh#@y service.

22,"I have technicians coming over and the problem was never fixed. My internet connection keeps disconnecting, the streaming is bad, my speed it supposed to be around 105mbps and its is never close to that. I am tired of calling them and they try to fix everything online and is not working. They keep saying that if they send a technician it will be $40 dollars. I used to have my own modem and recently changed to their modem because supposedly my brand new modem was bad. Prices are abusive for a really low quality service. Costumer service is horrible. My current bill is around 115 and is going to go up to 125 next year according to their new contract method which is not even clear. If you try to disconnect their system now they charge you like $10 dollars for the months left on the contract and they never explain that in any of the calls. If you call for cancellation they are always hanging up the phone and trying to get you involve into a contract. It is the only company that supports high speed internet in my area and they are taking advantage of that. I am paying for a service that should be monitor since is not giving the customers what they are paying for. You spend around 2-3 hours trying to fix a problem with them which I think is not very efficient. You can look at the reviews online how many people is been affected by this company services.

24,"My boyfriend has complained already about this issue, but I'm going to add mine as well. I may not ""officially"" be the consumer since my name is not on the bill, but I am the one that actually needs the internet for school, so I consider myself an official consumer of this product. To reiterate my boyfriend's initial complaint: We are paying for 25 mbps for our internet speed and are only receiving on AVERAGE 4-8 mbps, sometimes it dips as low as 0.02. Yes. ZERO. POINT. TWO. This has been going on FOR MONTHS. This is unacceptable. If that weren't enough, Comcast has admitted on several occasions that it is on their end and/or their equipment is causing the issue. We were afraid to have a tech come out to us, as they are deceptive about charging hundreds of dollars for a tech to come out, even though they say they won't (you can google this, there are numerous complaints about that issue itself). We finally agreed to have a tech come out because it is better than sitting here with useless internet access.
 On to my complaint: The first appointment we tried to schedule was for a 6:30-8:30pm time slot. We wait around and then we get a call from them saying they're not sure why the appointment was made for that time because they don't even schedule them that late! What? How does this even happen?!
 The second appointment was scheduled for today from 3:00-5:00pm. It is 5:50pm and surprise, surprise, THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP! I finally have a Saturday off- one that I would much rather spend doing something fun for once, but no, I have to waste a perfectly good day off waiting around for no one! I don’t even get a call, NOTHING!
 As you can see, I am very very frustrated with this company. They have a monopoly, and thus they hold the internet hostage. They don’t care about the consumer, but they demand hundreds of dollars a month and for what? 0.02 mbps speed internet. They are nothing but a bunch of crooks. It’s PATHETIC that they are allowed to do this and have been doing it for YEARS.
 I need the internet to study for my board exam I have to take in less than a month. I work full time, sometimes putting in 60+ hours/wk. I do not have time to deal with such ineptitude, I am stressed enough as it is. I just moved into my boyfriend's place, so I cannot go to the library because I don't have mail here yet. I cannot study in a crowded noisy coffee shop- I would like to be able to study and have use of the internet in my own home, ESPECIALLY if I/we are paying for 25 mbps! We work hard for our money, we would like to make good use of it. I know we are not the only ones and I think it's deplorable that Comcast is allowed to steal millions of people's money for NOTHING.

 Hi
 Thank you for your submission. Your request has been received and assigned Ticket No. 370363.
 Unfortunately, your complaint has missing or incomplete information and we are unable to take further action at this time.
 So we can address your complaint as quickly as possible, please provide the information described below within 7 business days.
 You can provide the information by replying directly to this email.
 Comcast will only respond to a complaint from the customer. In order to complet this complaint I would need the name of the comcast customer (your boyfirend)"
25,"On the xfinity website, they offer Digital Economy television service (45+ channels) for $19.99 per
 month and Economy Plus internet service (3 Mbps) for $19.99 per month. I was able to add both
 these services to the cart and check out. However, the xfinity representative called a couple of days
 later and said that I could not have the services selected even though either one was available in my
 area. Instead they said I would have to select either their Internet Plus package (10 channels and 25
 Mbps Internet) for 39.99/mo or their Blast Plus (45 channels and 50 Mbps) for 59.99/mo. When
 escalated to a manager they indicated that it was because I was selecting both a TV and Internet
 offer. There was no disclosure on teh website that both offers are not available together and it seems
 outragous that I can not take advantage of both deals."
26,"We are trying to get an itemization of our Bill from Comcast / Xfinity. My husband is a disabled veteran and is going back to school so that he might be able to have a Career that will sustain for the rest of his years until he is at retirement age. Because of the help from the VA department he can be reimbursed for the portion of the bill that we pay for the internet. We have been trying to get an itemization so that we can submit it for reimbursement. Little did we know that this would end up being one of the hardest things to do? I have called last month and try to get the answer in writing. The Customer Service department told me that they could not do that, they told me that they could tell me verbally and I could write it down. That is not how it works in the system. We have to show the VA that this is who we have service through and the amount that we are paying.
 I called again yesterday June 18,2015 and asked again for the information that I needed, I was told then that they could unbundle our bill and once we saw the information that we needed we could bundle our bill again, but that they could not guarantee that it would be the same price that we are paying right now. I asked to talk to a Supervisor who in turn told me the same thing. He told me that he can go to the information in our plan and click the plus button next to the plan we are on and that shows him the price of the internet and the modem. He stated that he could not e-mail me the information because of the chance of him or Comcast being held accountable. I then told him that I wanted to speak to someone higher up than him. He asked me who I thought that might be. I told him that he had to have a Boss and I wanted to speak to that person. He told me that they were off. Find it hard to believe. I then told him that there had to be a Number or a Place that I could talk to someone with higher authority than he has. He finally gave me a number to call and address to write to.
 I called the number and got a hold of someone in the Executive Customer Care department, who were helpful to a small extent. They escalated the issue to a higher position. I asked that they call me on my cell phone because I had things that I had to do. They did call but on our house phone, I did not get the message until after 6:30 with a case number to reference. The message stated that you could call between the hours of 8 AM to 7PM Monday thru Friday. I immediately tried to call and was directed to an answering machine; I left my information and have not had a return phone call. I gave them till 10:26 this morning and tried again and got the same voice mail message. I waited until 10:58 and called the number for the Executive Customer Care team again. I then explained again what was going on and advised that I again needed a call back to be on my cell phone. I still have yet to get a call back, so I tried again at 3:43 and got the same message, I called the Executive Customer Care Team at 3:45 PM. I told the woman that I spoke to that If I did not get a call back by 6:00PM I was contacting the Attorney General , The PUC, The FCC and whatever other agency that I needed to.
 It is now after 6:00PM on June 19, 2015. I am sending a copy of this letter to Comcast and all of the above mentioned agencies. We feel that we are not asking for anything that is not ours. This should have been as simple as where would you like this to be sent to.

31,"When we signed up for internet service with this company over ten years ago, it was under the
 condition of no data caps. Now for the past year, this company has been charging us almost double
 our bill for exceeding their arbitrary and non-agreed upon data cap of 300gb per month. An additional
 finding is that they state that ""Atlanta"" is one of the test markets in which this cap is enacted. Well,
 we live in Roswell (Alpharetta post office) not Atlanta. I wish to have this data cap eliminated based
 on the plan we originally chose and all of the overage fees that this fraudulent company has charged
 us refunded."
32,"I have moved form Marietta, GA 30067 to new address at
 Alpharetta, GA, 30022 on 5/23/2015 . I raised an movement request with comcast in 2
 weeks in advance and I got my new account# created so that it becomes hassle
 free. The lady over the phone told it will be free of cost. Also she told to carry tv box and model with
 me. But it become a nightmare. They did not do anything and when I try to activate my service in my
 new home they realize that it is not able to detect my modem and suggested to return my model to
 the local office. which I did next day morning. But still it was not able to detect the modem. Then I
 have to schedule the technician's appointment so that I can get the cable connection. Also in the
 mean time they sold an service protection insurance of 5.99 per month.
 I was supposed to work form home this week (5/26-5/29) as I am moving. But due to internet
 unavailability I have to rely on xfinitywifi which is also not very consistent all the time. When I ask for
 help they try to sell phone service. I got mad because of all these and hung up.
 Now I see an confirmation email and they are going to charge me $193 (estimated total) due to this
 move.
 It is really frustrating the way they are looting their customers after so many hassle. I loss office hours
 as I was supposed to work form home. On top of that they are charging money which was told over
 the phone that they will not charge anything.
 Despite of raising move request more than 2 weeks before nothing they did to make it hassle free."

 Starting June 1st till June 4th, my Internet Data Usage as per Comcast is 45 GB. I strongly doubt that, i used so much internet in a day. My wife and I are the only residents. We watch youtube, netflix and i play an online game.
 When i ask them to tell me how it read soo much. They told me they do not have that information. I do not know if it is the truth vs its a mis calculation. They can not properly back the data usage that they are charging me for.
 Please help.

38,"Comcast is my internet carrier and yesterday 05/20/2015 I received a message saying that my
 internet has been disconnected and in order to reconnected it I have to pay $30.40 and they are
 requesting for my credit or debit card information in addition they are requesting to make a direct
 withdraw from my bank account. The message in my computer is requesting to access to a website:
 https://consumer.comcast.com/walledgarden
 I have immediately called Comcast and they knew about this situation and apologized to me and said
 that they will fix the problem but hasn’t fixed the problems yet. I cannot access to my computer and
 have been trying to call Comcast since then and cannot go through. I also want to indicate that my
 monthly bill with Comcast has increased for equipment (modem) that I bought on my own at this
 point I think they are charging me for a modem that they don’t even supply me. Another issue is that
 Comcast does not advertise the price for services online. I have to call Comcast to get that info.
 RESOL: I want to have my internet connection connected back, I don’t think I have to pay for
 equipment that they do not supply to me and I want to see the prices for services online. CTR-11"
39,"Comcast is provably throttling the signal of customers who use alternative TV service. We switched to Dish Network a few years ago, anytime we tried to use on Demand it said our signal was too slow. Then we switched to DirectTv. The same thing happened until I swit our router to Open DNS. Now Comcast has moved everyone to their new gateway midem/routers and once again it is impossible to use On Demand satellite services. This is the same thing did with NetFlix before they reached a settlement. My parents also switched to an alternative TV provider and immediately their internet slowed to the point of being useless too and they can not use on Demand features either. Just Google this complaint and you will see that anyone who rejects Comcast TV service pays for it with inferior Internet speeds and almost no access to satellite providers. For further proof, other streaming services and NetFlix ( post settlement) work fine.

45,"I ordered an internet plan. I was told it would be $49.99 but was billed $54.99. They said the 'extra' $5 was for not having ""Ecobilling"" yet i was never told that I needed this when I agreed to the plan & price.
 Furthermore, in the meantime. I've asked for a plan with a lower rate i can afford- just with internet- but they consistently come back with bundled plans that include TV etc. They have the only really acceptable product for inteernt service in my area.
 My request now is to be billed as I was sold- at $49.99/mo- already $5 over my previous plan & not $10as they've done. ( Though, i did try to get onto Ecobill- with no luck - & over an hour dealing with their reps,etc. & at this point I'd rather not)
 I feel their sales techniques & representation of the service & fee was deceptive. Their company was built on public trust- the laying of cable lines etc.- yet they go to great lengths to take advantage & squeeze out excessive rates. ( Also, $10/ month for modem rental? You've got to be kidding! I finally figured that out on my own & bought one)

46,"Comcast refuses to let me cancel my internet/cable and provide proof that my service has been
 terminated. I have called 4 times (and counting hangups/discontents pushing 15 calls) and requested
 2 emails.
 I called on May the 4th 2015 to get my Comcast internet/cable canceled as I will no longer be living at
 my current residence. I will be moving for work. I do not have any of Comcast's equipment thus a
 cancellation of service should be relatively easy. When I first talked to the representative Kate, she
 attempted to make me feel bad for canceling both internet and cable. Then she told me that they
 have a system upgrade going on and they can not process my request until an hour later. Her
 supervisor (Jake employee ID:6850SR) reiterated her story about the system upgrade. Kate called
 me back to tell me that the upgrade will take until their office closes and that they will call me back the
 next day to complete the request. They never called. This is how Comcast found a way to extend the
 billing date. I was told the ending date was on May the 4th but when I called on the 5th they claimed it
 was the 5th.
 I have spoken with many representatives. Two of which have said ""I will get an email at
 confirming the cancellation within 24 hours""(both read the email address to me
 letter by letter). The last of these representatives being Tamika (?) (Employee ID 1361) from the
 retention department. I have received no such email (not even in my spam folder).
 As of May 13th Comcast's telephone tree disconnects me right before talking to an agent. I am
 contacting the FCC in the hopes that they can help resolve this dispute. Furthermore, I hope this
 indicates what poor customer service Comcast continues to have despite their claims to try to get
 better. Thank you fro your attention to this matter.

47,"Hello,
 I signed up for Comcast internet on 01/30/15 and received the equipment on 02/04. I plugged in the
 equipment on 02/06 yet there's no signal. I called the Comcast and they could not get a signal from
 their end either. The representative told me that she needed to send someone out to take a look. I
 asked if there's going to be a charge, she said no (and I assume this was recorded), said since I was
 a new customer and they were not able to activate my account/modem, there shouldn't be any
 charge.
 The technician came out and fixed the problem on 02/09 . All he did was to connect the cable at the
 switch box located somewhere in our subdivision. The technician specifically told me the cable for
 my house was never connected and the line was not properly labeled either. After he connected the
 cable line, I was able to get a signal.
 I was subsequently charged $39.95 for this ""Technician Visit"" that occurred on 02/09. I do not agree
 that I should be paying for this charge for the following reasons:
 1. The contract I signed specifically said there's no activation fee. As a new customer, whatever
 Comcast needed to do in order to activate my new account/modem, should not be my responsibility.
 The sole purpose of the ""Technician Visit"" was to connect the cable at the switch box that Comcast
 owns; this is the very basic, necessary step that Comcast must perform in order to provide me the
 internet connection that I have signed up for. If Comcast requires a new customer to pay for their
 cable to be connected at the switch box, it should have been disclosed up front - in my case, it wasn't.
 2. I have contacted Comcast Customer Service 6 times to resolve this ""Technician Visit"" charge. The
 first three times I was assured a credit of equal will be issued within 24-48 hours (and I assume these
 phone calls were recorded) but it never happened. Then I was told nothing was documented in the
 work log. Then I was told it has to be escalated and it'll take another 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I
 was getting fined for late payment (of this disputed charge) and that my service will be cancelled if I
 do not pay this charge. The last time I contacted Comcast, I was told there's nothing they can do. So
 I had no choice but paid the $39.95.
 I wanted to bring this to your attention because I am so appalled by the way Comcast conducts their
 business. I believed I have been unfairly charged for the technician visit fee, and the representatives
 at Customer Service are not held accountable for what's been said or promised.
 Thanks,"
48,"Consumer is having billing and service issues with Comcast (cable and internet). He started a bundle in September and in December he started being charged a $10 for equipment. They never notified him of the increase. This started other billing issues, Comcast requesting an extra $100 almost every month. He returned the equipment that he was being charged $10 extra for but Comcast still bills him. Comcast also frequently shuts his internet service off, two to three times per month for illegitimate reasons. He will call Comcast and they say they have to change his frequency. He does not have very many neighbors and during the outages most people are at work, so it cannot be a congestion issue. They do this but still charge the same price. Today the internet service went out again and Comcast said to replace the equipment when the service worked fine yesterday and was working for three weeks. They have no regards for their customers. He feels like he is being opposed and taken advantage of by Comcast. Comcast sucked over $400 in extra fees from him since starting services. Comcast says these charges are legitimate and refuse to budge. As a resolution, he would like Comcast to refund him for the additional fees that they did not notify him about. He would also like a refund for the time that his internet service was out and for them to resolve the issue that causes the internet to go out. ***CTR359-phone***

50,"Consumer said that she has an issue with Comcast. She said the issue has been happening for a while. She was in internet essentials program through Comcast in 2013. She said in Feb 2014 because the bill didn’t seem right so she called the company and the company told her that they would fix the issue and offered her a free home phone. She was under the assumption she was still on the internet essentials program but when she went to pay her bill at the store she talked to the employee and they said she was not on the program any longer and she was paying for the home phone. She found out her services were shut off last Friday and are still currently off. When she called Comcast on this and asked why her services were off they were not sure so they turned it back on. She was supposed to have to the 16th to pay the past due but she shouldn’t pay the bill until a supervisor called back and straightened out the bill with her but no one called her. Once she talked with Comcast they informed her that they could credit her one month of service and give 6 months of a premium channel even though she overpaid 16 months of service. Comcast said she should have caught the issue within 6 months of getting the service which she did in February however that rep said he fixed the issue and gave her the free home phone. As a resolution she feels the company owes her more than what she received for the inconvenience this has caused her. She said that they should have offered like 6 months free service or at least give her some of her money back that she over paid. She also has another call back number of . ***CTR 354-phone***

 still terrible NO improvement
 I am totally frustrated with all the delays and department switches Comastcputs me thru each time I

55,"This is about cable television, not internet, so I don't know why there are questions below about internet service. My bill has been increasing substantially, but I cannot reach customer service in a reasonable fashion to get an explanation as to why. I've tried to call or contact customer service online three times over the course of the past several months to get my issue resolved, and have been on hold for almost an hour. Once I hung up, another time I finally got a customer service rep after over an hour. When I asked her why my bill increased so much even though I haven't changed service, she said it's because it's a new account and they include the set up fee. What??? I've had this account for almost 9 years. Was on with her for another 15 or 20 minutes and then just could not waste more time on it. Their website says they have customer service agents available 24/7 by phone. When you call the phone in the evening (as many working/commuting people must have to do), it tells you they only answer phones from 7 to 7, but that if you go online, there's someone available 24/7. And when you go online, there is no (easily identifiable) link to speak with customer service. In the meantime, I have yet another increase, so now it seems to me that I'm paying almost $20 more per month than I was when I opened the account, but with no extra service. I went to their Facebook page and see complaint after complaint about their service, but it is still subpar. Unfortunately they have basically a monopoly in this area, unless I go with satellite cable, which I am at the point of doing. I don't know how they can make it so difficult for customers to get their issues resolved.

56,"As can be seen from my final statement from Comcast (attached), I canceled internet service on March 23, 2014 for service at , 22202. I subsequently moved to Apt. in the same apartment complex, which Comcast was aware of and is the address listed on the final statement.
 The statement said I was due a $54.77 payment credit.
 After many months, I still had not been paid the $54.77 payment credit I was owed. I called Comcast, and was told for some reason they believed I had un-returned equipment (a cable modem) that had caused the payment credit to be withheld, pending some investigation.
 I have owned my cable modem for years, and bought it from a friend when I lived in Seattle years ago (the service at issue here is in Virginia). One of the reasons why I canceled Comcast, in fact, was because they started charging me, spontaneously after having service for many many months, a modem rental charge for my own modem that I had been using the entire time. I had to call Comcast to have the monthly charge removed (which they did). You can see no mention of a modem rental charge as a service that I canceled on page two of the attached statement.
 It has now been over one year since I have been owed my $54.77 credit. I would like to be payed what I am owed, and am very displeased with Comcast's insistence completely out of the blue that my modem spontaneously became theirs.

58,"I work for the federal government and am the CIO of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). We support a large telework contingent. Two days ago our VOIP access from home to TTB stopped working for our users that have Comcast as an ISP. It continues to work for all other users that have a different ISP. All other services over Comcast work (i.e. laptop VPN that uses TCP port 443). We have an in-house Internet test system that shows UDP Port 443 being blocked. We also see this on our Internal VOIP logs. My fundamental issue (other than it not working) is that there is no way for a TTB network engineer to work with Comcast to resolve this on behalf of our users. The only way to get support is to have each individual contact Comcast directly. Since the users have no technical network knowledge, they get the script reading support people and a session that ends with we (Comcast) changed nothing and the issue is yours. That ignores the simple fact that it has worked for years and years and continues to work for anyone that has a different ISP. Any help appreciated.

 I was contacted last evening by a host of Comcast personnel. We received excellent support and the problem is resolved. For the record - the UDP port 443 traffic was making it out of the Comcast network but was not making it to TTB. Another provider between Comcast and TTB implemented a security fix last week that caused the issue. Comcast worked directly with that provider and caused the issue to be fixed. We are appreciative of this level of support and Comcast has requested that I use the contacts provided in the event of a similar issue in the future. This addresses all issues in my complaint.

59,"Ongoing issues with service and billing since January 2013.
 We have had repeated issues with Comcast's Internet and Television services. We are on our 5th router, our 3rd cable box and still routinely do not receive hi-speed internet or have issues with our cable TV. We have wasted many hours of our time dealing with representatives over the phone, as well as wasted many hours with technicians coming to our residence and telling us that everything is fine and that the problem has been resolved.
 We are just now beginning to experience the same level of incompetence with their billing department. We spoke with Comcast billing back in February 2015 because our bill had been raised $80 since we first started with Comcast. We were assured that Comcast wanted to keep us and would lower our bill to $150. That did not happen. We called back on May 24, as our bill had now crept even higher to $110 more than we had first agreed to, at $210.78. We were told the same thing, that Comcast wanted to keep us, and that with removing a movie package and applying a promotional offer they could get us down to $154.99. I asked for and received the name and badge number of the representative and was assured I would be receiving an email confirming the change.
 The next day, we received an email stating that our bill was now $163.26 effective immediately. As our movie package was gone, we expected that we had finally been given a lower rate. This did not happen and our bill for this month is the higher rate. We called back on June 15, and were told they had no record of this change. Even with the name and badge number of the previous person we had spoken with the billing department said they could not be of assistance and would have to transfer us to another department. We sat on hold for 5 minutes before we were told by an automated message that the department was closed for the evening and to call back the next day. I called back immediately to speak with billing and was told that yes, the department I needed to speak with was closed.

63,"We have had high speed internet service (and cable) with Comcast since October of 2014 in Arlington, VA. We have continually had problems with the internet service - it goes in and out constantly and even when it is ""on"" - it is insanely slow - so slow that a speed tracker website cannot even load to track it (slower than dial up was in 1995 - really). I have called several times, several technicians have come out, and each time they check everything, say the signal is working perfectly, and that it must be a problem with our laptops/phones/modem/router, etc. We've replaced equipment, tried the connection with about a dozen different devices, to no avail. Most recently, we had a technician out on 6/18/15, who spent two hours, could not figure out the problem, but promised that a manager would be coming over on Sunday morning. We communicated on Friday, 6/19 about setting up an appointment for a manager to come out. I was continuously promised that a manager would be coming on Sunday morning, or calling - but nobody showed up, nobody called. I called Comcast again early on 6/22 to cancel the internet service (since it hasn't ever worked and nobody seems able to fix it), but was told that an early termination fee would apply. I asked to speak to a manager, and I was told there was no way to avoid the early termination fee. I asked to speak to a manager, and I was told that I'd have to be put on a list to receive a call back. I have not heard back. As of now, I have no internet service, have been continuously attempting to get them to fix it for almost 9 months, to no avail, and now am being told that to cancel a service that I've been paying for but not receiving, I'm going to have to pay more to just simply cancel it. We do not have any other cable service provider in the area, but I was planning on getting Verizon DSL.

64,"I pay almost $70 a month for internet from Comcast and I am regularly, (ie 2-4 times a week, some times multiple times within a day) notified by my alarm company that my internet is out. It isn't my equipment, it's the signal being dropped from the modem. Some times it comes back after a few seconds and other times it take 10-20 minutes to get a good, stable internet connection. Lately, the connection has been so unstable that my phone automatically turns WiFi off. Also, I've had to tell my Alarm company to ""ignore the communication error"" because it was become so frequent.
 This is all very, very frustrating because I don't have any other options for broadband and the basic speed that Comcast offers. Let me say that again, I don't have any other options, and Comcast has told me as much when I have called to complain.

65,"A couple of days ago, my Comcast service (high-speed internet + cable TV) was suspended because I have a past due amount of $202 that I wasn't able to pay by the deadline. I work part time and I was out sick many days, which means I didn't get paid for those days and my latest paychecks were lower than usual. I contacted Comcast's regional headquarters in MD to make payment arrangements. I first asked if I could pay the $202 in two different installments from two different paychecks, but I was told I needed to pay the full amount to be reconnected. So, I agreed to pay the $202 on July 3rd when I get my next paycheck. It's a stretch but I absolutely need at least the Internet to be restored ASAP because I'm taking online classes to pass a math placement test that I need to take at my university in order to be able to sign up for any classes for Fall 2015. I also do freelance graphic/web design work and that helps me make ends meet. However, the customer service executive told me I needed to pay the $202 by July 1st because on that day the system would generate a new bill and at that point I would owe $348 and $202 would no longer be enough to reconnect my service. He allegedly couldn't circumvent or override the system manually. Now, I think this is ridiculous. It's just a matter of 48 hours!!! Plus, it's strange that an executive has no control over an automated system. I don't get to decide when I receive my paychecks and it's not like I was unwilling to pay my past due amount. I won't be able to pay $348 on July 3rd because my paycheck will only be in the $500 range -- as I said before, paying $202 is already a stretch. That means that I won't be able to get my service back for most of the month of July and I've been a Comcast customer for 12 years!!! If I can't study for my test now, I'll end up taking it in August when all classes will be full and I might end up losing my financial aid and having to apply to the university again! I'll definitely seek legal advice and sue Comcast if that ends up being the case, but I hope this complaint will be enough for them to contact me and accept a $202 payment on July 3rd to reconnect my service. One last thing: whenever I ask to be switched to a cheaper plan or cancel my cable TV, I'm told I need to pay my full balance before I can make any changes to my service. And any plan for existing customers is much more expensive than the deals that new customers get. This company doesn't seem to value its long-time customers at all, yet, it has been overcharging us for years and we're the reason why it's so rich. I would gladly switch providers if I could, but in my particular area Comcast is sadly the only option for high-speed internet...

 Request #424671 ""Horrible Customer Service"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #424671:
 I'm writing to follow up on my Comcast disconnection odyssey. After filing numerous complaints, last night I was contacted by phone by an alleged Comcast executive who identified herself as ""Stacy"" (no last name).
 ""Stacy""'s reason for not wanting to restore my service is that I ""promised"" to pay the $139 on July 17, but I didn't, so that's a breach of contract and I will never have my service restored until I pay in full. She couldn't care less that I could pay that amount only on August 14, and by then it wouldn't be enough to get me back on because a new bill would be generated and the past due would increase. When I told her that I can't afford to be without the internet for so long because I need it for work, she had the nerve to say that my internet is ""for entertainment"". Says who? I freelance and I occasionally work from home for my part-time job, too. I don't own a business, so it's more cost effective for me to (b) (6)
 (b)
 (6)
 (b) (6)
 just pay for residential high speed internet than a business plan. Ms. ""Stacy"" doesn't live with me and has no right to infer that I use my internet ""for entertainment"" -- she can't possibly know how much time I spend on it working or studying vs watching cat videos on YouTube!
 Also, just to clarify, I never ""promised"" to pay the whole $139 on July 17. I said that would be the first day I could make a payment because I was getting a paycheck, and I did mean to pay as much as I could, but my electricity would be shut off if I didn't pay at least $70 and that took priority. At least, Dominion accepts payment arrangements and works with you splitting the payments as you can afford them.
 When I complained that I'm never allowed to downgrade my service and cancel my TV until I pay the full past due amount, ""Stacy"" said ""TV and internet is the same"" which is not because I would save $30 a month if I only paid for internet. Then she tried to blame me for not calling to cancel when the service is working as opposed to disconnected, which I have done an infinite number of times.
 In the end, she adamantly denied to restore my service and told me if I want to find a lawyer to help me with this, it's my right (but it didn't seem to concern her, as in her mind Comcast is right and maybe too powerful to be deterred by a lawsuit).
 I did let her know that this is very bad customer service and now I want to let the FCC, too.
 After this conversation, I called to cancel my service and the retention representative I spoke to had more common sense and waived the late fee on my past due because I've been with Comcast for 12 years and I'm behind - what? - maybe a month, month and a half? Big deal!
 I've really been through health issues and financial hardship and all I'm asking is to get at least my internet restored so I can work from home and study online instead of losing money and falling behind with my classes and homework. I'm not asking to get away with not paying my past due. I will eventually catch up. What's the difference between paying half of it on July 31 and the other half on August 14 or paying all of it on August 14? In the end, Comcast would still receive the same amount that I owe.
 It may not be Comcast's policy to accommodate such payment arrangements, but life happens and customers can get ill, lose their jobs, have unexpected expenses, etc. (According to the office of the VA Attorney General, Comcast makes its own rules and there's no organization that has the power to oversee and regulate them -- if this is true, it's ridiculous! It gives corporations carte blanche to abuse customers as they please, which is unfair!)
 A company with a heart who really cares about its customers should have a policy in place to help and retain such customers during a rough patch.
 I know Comcast proudly offers high speed internet access for $10 a month to families with at least one child who qualifies for a free meal or a subsidized meal at school. That's great, but there are many more people who struggle financially and they have the same rights to access the internet, especially if they use it to work and study.
 From now on, I'll be happy to discourage anybody I know from signing up with Comcast or suggest they switch providers if they're lucky enough to have a choice (unfortunately, I'm not). I may not get
 my internet back, but I'll take advantage of every free wireless spot and my cell phone service to post my story to any available public forum so that everybody knows how horrible Comcast's customer service is. Well, not everybody is horrible -- the reps I talked to last night after ""Stacy"" called me (one from Retention and one from Collections) were actually pretty nice and reasonable, but they had their hands tied by company policies and couldn't do anything to help me restore my service.
 I know losing a customer is no big deal financially for a giant like Comcast, but business isn't just about money. It's also about ethics and satisfying/retaining customers.
 I wish I had the option of switching providers, but where I live I'm stuck with Comcast, at least for high-speed internet, and I need to solve my case ASAP. I have to work and study and can't wait until August 14 (provided they accept a $128 payment to restore my service then...).

 Request #413640 ""Disconnected again!"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #413640:
 So, only a few days after solving my previous complaint and restoring my service, Comcast suspended it again because I have a $138.00 past due. I already told the executive who looked into my case when I filed my previous complaint that I'm going through a time of financial hardship due to illness (though I do have a professional job, I'm part time and paid by the hour, so I don't get paid sick leave). I was hoping I could make the payment last Friday when I got my paycheck, but I had to catch up with my electric bill and only have $11 in my account left. I won't be able to pay the $138 until August 31 when I get my next paycheck and even then, I can only make a partial payment because I was sick and my paycheck will only be $300. However, I need the internet restored ASAP to follow my online class and do freelance design work. I've asked Comcast multiple times to let me cancel my cable TV, which would make it easier for me to catch up with my payments, but they always refused, saying I need to pay all my past due amount first. This is like a vicious circle and I'm tired of filing complaints and begging to have my service restored. I wish I had an alternative for high-speed Internet in my apartment complex but alas it's either Comcast or nothing. I will catch up with the bill, but I need time and I need reliable internet service for my online courses and work. I'm wondering if you can help me not only get my internet restored, but also my cable TV canceled so I don't keep being billed $138.00 every month, which is making it impossible for me to keep up with the expenses."
66,"I've had a number of issues with Xfinity in the last month. Not only service that wasn't working for almost a month, rude customer service reps, promised packages that I was later told ""don't exsist"" and hidden charges on my account I was told would be credited to my account, then weeks later were still on my account and no one ""Could help me"" review those credits.
 They sent out a tech who was late, stayed over 3 hours, wouldn't take my equipment and then proceeded to tell me they gave me a package that doesn't exsist and he couldn't set up my services and refused to take my broken equipment. I was charged $70 for this visit without my knowledge. I was told by a supervisor that the fee would be refunded since it was never disclosed and I never signed or agreed to this. A month later the fee is still on the account and no one will help me. When I called today the rep wouldn't let me talk to a supervisor, told me no one is available to help me, talked so rudely to me then hung up on me. I'm sick of the run around and I don't understand how they can lie so many times and charge people hidden fees.

67,"I think more than 8 years ago and with little interruptions, I have had contract with COMCAST as Internet Service Provider. As I remember, at the beginning with COMCAST the monthly rent payment for a CABLE MODEM was $5 a month. On December 2014, due to some difficulties to access the Internet, I was recommended by COMCAST'S Customer Service to replace the Cable Modem for a new one. Then I decided to stop the Cable Modem renting way from COMCAST and to buy a new one with my own money, and to return the obsolete Cable Modem to COMCAST. After getting the next COMCAST'S monthly bill, I was really so surprised: $8 less to pay, then I got some questions that are the reason of this Complaint: 1. Do COMCAST have been charging $5 or more than that to the customers, for a depreciated and obsolete electronic device? 2. If it is true, is it Legal to increase the rent price for an electronic device that at the same time is becoming obsolete? 3. In my opinion a Company who rents an electronic device, should decrease the rent just as the electronic device become obsolete. In my case I think that in average I have paid more than $600 for an electronic device that I guess it would cost $40 or les for an Internet Service Provider. Are there Legal Regulations to protect the customers for this kind of situations or am I completely wrong on everything? I APPRECIATE TO FCC, FOR GIVING US THE CITIZENS THE POSSIBILITY TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I have had to call each time in order to figure out why my bill has changed and I end up spending more time than I would care to trying to get my bill back to the rate that I was paying. If I could, I would gladly charge Comcast an hourly rate for the time that I spend dealing with them on the phone.

75,"In light of the vote by the FCC to protect a free and open internet I would like to file a complaint about Comcast's use of internet usage caps in the Atlanta market.
 The current caps are set at a lower level than should be realistically acceptable in today's world of high-quality video streaming and cloud-based computing+storage.
 Furthermore, the current caps set by Comcast vary from market to market. Atlanta customers are paying the exact same price for capped data than customers in markets with unlimited data. We should not get markedly poorer service for identical costs.
 While I understand the need to have rules to deter serial bandwidth abusers, I feel that the current caps in the Atlanta market are in place due to a virtual monopoly. This observation is backed up by Comcast's sudden announcement of unlimited, uncapped 2gps fiber service coming soon to Atlanta, which would never have happened had Google Fiber not announced its far more competitive plans there in the future. Obviously if Comcast can offer uncapped 2Gps service to an estimated 18MM users, it is not nearly so strained for bandwidth that it must cap users at 300GB/mo. The cap is only viable due to their current monopoly.
 I am an ordinary consumer and not a business. However, I do two commonplace activities that shoot me far above Comcast's 300GB/mo cap:
 1) I stream Netflix TV shows a few days a week
 2) I use cloud-based backup services for my computer
 Backing up your computer is an absolute necessity. However, my laptop has a 1TB hard drive, so I end up needing to upload nearly 400GB just to back up my personal photos, videos, and documents - some of the most important things in my life.
 Data caps are anti-competition, are counter to our country's values about a free and open internet, are inflicted on users who initially signed contracts offering uncapped services, and are set at an unreasonably low bar.
 Please investigate Comcast's use of data caps in Atlanta and move to prevent these anti-consumer actions.

76,"This is not acceptable. Comcast is running 300gb data cap ""trials"" in Atlanta- one of the cities where it has a virtual monopoly. This is not enough data for anyone who does a normal amount of web activity. Plus we are paying the same as other cities that are not subject to the data cap. Please see to it that this is addressed.

77,"On December 20, 2014, I realized my introductory year on my Comcast Internet plan would end in January 2015. I decided to call Comcast to discuss options for the upcoming year of 2015 for my Internet service. I webchatted with Hittesh, the customer service representative. This is the copied part of our webchat that clarifies our agreement (screenshot attached): “, I have checked for you and I am not getting anything lower then your current package price with same package internet plus. However I can give you same package of $ 39.99 for next 12 months from today onwards. It will stay same till next year 12/20/2015. How this sound?” We agreed to these terms, and he assured me this would be included on my account.
 Then, I received my bill in January 2015 in the amount of $62.59. The monthy bill should have been the same as in 2014, which was $52.65. (There are changes for a modem lease and tax on top of the aforementioned $39.99 package price.)
 On February 2, I spoke with a few personnel to clear up the issue. I had the screen shot (attached) as evidence of the agreement Hittesh and I had reached, so I thought it was a simple mistake in the system. The personnel went on to tell me that it was a mistake on the part of customer service and could not be allowed by the billing department, that the $62.59 bill was the lowest they could offer me. They routed me to a few people in different departments and even told me I needed to call customer service and “renegotiate” the terms with them (which they also conflictingly told me would be impossible to “enforce” in billing regardless). The people I spoke with include Alexandra (AD4) and Javier Cavalie in the billing department (direct line at 954.534.7151). Javier assured me he would resolve the issue and get back with me, telling me I could call him directly. He then went on to ignore my phone messages and never got back in touch. This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have had, but of course there are few options for Internet service.
 My compliant is that even with documentation (attached) of an agreement between customer service and a customer, Comcast does not uphold their own self-made commitment. Please let me know if there is anything that can be done.
 Many thanks,

78,"On three occasions, Comcast has billed me incorrectly. In each occassion, the company's customer service department did not provide a solution and refused to admit error. Only when I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau did Comcast respond to their billing error. The lack of competition in the internet service market enabled Comcast to provide horrible customer service and inflated high speed internet rates.

79,"I have Comcast Triple Play bundled services, at a cost of $240/month. This month I received notice 5
 days from the end of this month (April) that I had used 90% of my allotted cap, and had 30GBs
 remaining. I then got notice 3 days later that I had used an additional 89GBS. When I got the first
 notice, I became very aware of my usage, which to me had not really been extraordinary this
 month..other than watching more Netflix than usual after having dental work...but I was also out of
 town for 4 days. I looked back at the last 3 months and had used 129,139 and 164 GBs during those
 months. So this is very strange and suspicious to me. I posted questions about this to my
 neighborhood email group, and many people said this has happened to them as well. I won't be
 charged for the overage this time, but I really don't want this to happen again...and there is no other
 good choice for service."
80,"I paid my bill as of 044/15/2015 online. The bill states that the amount due is 26.99. So i paid 26.99.
 the next day I check my balance. It states my balance is $0.00. Now I am being charged for not
 paying my bill in full. Due to the fact that this happen last month I took screen shots of each step of
 this process. If you need this information please feel free to contact me.
 When I did contact Comcast they tell me that it is my fault. They tell me its my fault because I do not
 receive paper bill. They told me because I choose not to receive paper bills the bill is not generated
 properly. They told me my internet bill will never be generated propely. So because I want to use
 paperless billing and save trees I am being punished.
 I need my bill fixed. I need to people at Comcast to work with me. There is obviously a glarying hole
 in their system and they dont care.
 I need to not be treated like I'm scum because I choose to save trees.
 These two people made me feel like its my fault for doing what the bill on the internet say to pay."
81,"Comcast has imposed an arbitrary ""data cap"" on my account merely because I live in Atlanta, GA.
 These ""caps"" are not in place in the majority of other markets. Comcast was the only broadband
 provider available at my address, otherwise I would have chosen a different ISP. This monopolistic
 behavior must not be tolerated."
82,"These data caps on Comcast are becoming a burden. In the age of steaming, working from home
 and Internet gaming - we are at a place where data caps can become costly fast for just casually
 using Internet. For example Comcast has a 300gb cap. Netflix happened to release an array of shoes
 while my roommate was watching his shows on Hulu on his computer and the other roommate was
 studying for his gmat with you tube videos. This happens almost daily and puts us around 700gb+!
 Now that totals to almost $100 in overage charges and the base we pay for TV and Internet is only
 $80! That's insane! We use Internet as a form of communication and as such that's the equivalent
 here of buying cable TV but they limit you to 40 hours of TV time a month. It's insane, I know that it's
 not because of infrastructure issues because they've not been enforcing this cap for years and
 recently implemented it a year ago! We are still getting similar unreliable speeds but now we're being
 charged more. I really am hoping for the FCC to take a stand here and really ban the use of datacaps
 on home broadband internet! On top of that prevent the collusion of ISPs in order to generate
 competition!"
83,"Shortly after getting Comcast's Xfinity internet service, they called me offering faster speeds for an
 additional $10/month. I declined the service. Several months later when reviewing my cable bills, I
 noticed the service had been added to my account and I was being charged the additional fees.
 I've called Comcast to demand a refund. They noted my complaint and said they would review it in
 24-48 hours. I had no other recourse to get my money back than to wait 2 days and call back."
84,"Last year Comcast implemented a new billing scheme where they cap monthly internet usage at 300
 gigabytes. Once the 300 gigabytes is reached Comcast charges $10 for each additional 50 gigabytes
 used. Per year, each customer is allowed 3 months where the 300 gigabyte threshold may be
 surpassed without penalty. I spoke with a Comcast representative last year who informed me that
 after 1 calendar year from my last free overage month, my 3 free months would reset. However, this
 did not occur and I am now told that my 3 free months, that should reset each year, will never return. I
 spoke with a Comcast rep last week that apologized on behalf of the company and said the policy
 was misleading and that in fact if you exhaust your 3 overage months and then go over 300 gigabytes
 the following month, it will not reset. However, this information is not to be found anywhere in
 Comcast's overage policy and was not presented as such when I spoke at length with representatives
 a year ago. This is a poor and misleading practice. The only remedy is for Comcast to honor their
 policy as presented on their website and reset the 3 courtesy overage months. Thank you.

85,"Several times there have been FCC complaints about cable service in my home. Continuously cable
 is cut off, sound going down, and pictures going off in the middle of programs. My mother receive a
 telephone call about telephone service for $15.00 a month. The service person came out on Monday,
 May 11, 2015 to service the telephones, but he only worked on one telephone and there were no
 connections to the other two telephones. He said, ""he would be back on Thursday, May 14, 2015,""
 but never came back nor on Friday, May 15. My mother called Comcast to ask about when the
 person was coming back to our home to fix what was messed up. My mother and Comcast/Xfinity
 agreed on Wednesday, May 20, 2015. After the last complaint to you we received a telephone call
 and a letter from Mrs. S. Clopton, Executive Escalation Specialist at 770-559-7128, (January 10,
 2015), given a $39.00 credit, but the cable is still blinking in and out, cutting off, Emergency
 Broadcast System for weekly and monthly going off several times in the middle of the night, sound
 going down, (during the news broadcast in the morning and evening), and completely out. I am a
 little tired of this company and their service. The last complaint was 76049."
86,"Hello,
 I'm here to file a complaint due to the 350GB data cap Comcast has enforced in Atlanta Georgia. With
 a $10 overage charge for every 50GB used after. Due to the cap I've had to limit using internet
 streaming services. I've discontinued my accounts with Netflix, WWE Network, Hulu, and also
 Crunchy Roll. With all services offering HD contact having a cap of that size is ludicrous. I would like
 to see the cap discontinued."
87,"I called in late April 2015 to have my service end on May 2, 2015. The customer service
 representative confirmed to me that it would be cancelled, but I was still being charged.
 I called again on May 22, 2015 after I received another bill. I was redirected multiple times, only to be
 abruptly hung up.
 Comcast continues to charge me for service and will not let me end it, even though I no longer reside
 at the service address."
88,"It is unnecessary and ridiculous to put an artificial cap on wired internet usage. I am not allowed to
 freely consume data without worrying about whether it will impact my ""data usage"" which is simply an
 artificial limit placed on a service that never had any limits. Providing additional GB of data costs
 cents on the dollar and I am being charge $10 every time I over step my bounds and only get 50 GB
 for that $10. Additionally, I do not get a credit on my bill for data under 300 GB per month. If data is so
 scarce why not roll over or actually credit us for unused precious data.
 It is theft to charge for an increment that is not used wholly. There is no money back for using less
 than the additional 50 GB provided. The logic is not there.
 The only thing this is used for is to create artificial scarcity and higher revenue for cable companies. It
 is so infuriating that these companies dictate how much data I can consume. ""Land of the free"" more
 like ""Land of the FEE"".
 Something needs to be done about cable companies fucking over regular americans. I am glad Tom
 Wheerler is taking a stand, but data caps are ridiculous, especially in a world where data
 consumption is only growing.
 Companies want to condition user to paying for data just like they did with cell phones. Please dont
 let US consumers get screwed by these companies' greed."
89,"Comcast sent a written communication stating that my bill was due on March 25. I planned to pay on
 March 25. When I got up that morning, my internet, television and phone line were disconnected. I
 called, but was on hold for an inordinate amount of time. I then chose the phone payment option by
 check because I was afraid my clients would call and get a ""disconnected"" message and I would lose
 my customers. When I paid the check by phone, I was forced to indicate that I accepted that I would
 pay a disconnection fee of an unstated amount. I do not believe my service should have been
 disconnected because ""due on March 25"" meant I could pay on that day.

 Hi, I am having a very difficult time speaking directly to anyone from Comcast. Their representative
 called me on June 4. I called on June 8 and left a detailed voicemail. She called again on the 7th. I
 couldn’t pick up the phone because I was driving and called right back. Voicemail again and I left a
 detailed message. She sent an email saying they were following up. She called again on June 9th. I
 tried to call right back and got voicemail again. Left another detailed message. Same thing again on
 yesterday, June 11th. I immediately called back and got voicemail and left a detailed message. Then
 they had a computer call me saying to indicate that I wanted to discuss my bill. It is an unfair
 expectation that I can immediately pick up the phone when they call. When I am not able to do this I
 lose my opportunity to talk about the problem because the calls all go to voicemail. Discussing my bill
 is not my problem. My problem as described in the complaint is that they disconnected my service on
 the day the bill was due per their written communication to me. They forced me to pay a reconnect
 fee and increased my monthly rate. Their behavior is for the purpose of creating the illusion that they
 are helping. I don’t think they intend to do anything but steal my money and hope you will not notice.

90,"300gb data cap is not reasonable. Over the years, we've only seen changes to home broadband
 which hurts consumers. As we increasingly become more digital (think 4k streaming, live tv
 streaming, on demand service, digital purchases of movies and games, working from home), we
 require more bandwidth. With all these on demand services, I've been hitting the 300gb limit within a
 week or two! There were times where I had to decline purchasing a digital game because I did not
 have enough data remaining (unless I pay for overages of course). This is price gouging at its worst
 and it's only hurt consumers, and in some ways the economy. This has to stop."
91,"Cannot contact Xfinity customer service to resolve billing problems. When I call their customer
 service phone number I am disconnected after it says it is ""transferring me to an agent"". I have been
 calling all day after they disconnected my internet service for non payment when I'm enrolled in an
 auto-pay program with them."
92,"I am getting overcharged with comcast / xfinity. I had cable, internet, phone with them at one point
 thinking that it was as great customer service company because there service was always great. I
 have my service for about six months and kept noticing that the bill was changing and that it was
 never caught up. They would tell me that my services were about to get interrupted by mail. Then
 other times I would just be turned off in the middle of the day. I was on the phone almost every week
 with a issue with comcast. I would call and get hung up on my the employees ALL THE TIME. I would
 ask to speak to someone in charge and I would be hung up on as they were acting as if it was a tech
 problem but I would call weeks apart and the same thing. I would call back and call back until I got
 someone. Sometimes being on hold for 45 mins only to be hung up on and would have to call back.
 One day i spent my ENTIRE evening trying to call them. I would tell them that they were overcharging
 me. They would talk down to me and try to get smart with me and tell me to get money and pay them.
 They would say on occasions that it doesn't matter because I was going to have to pay it anyway
 because they would only take money off my next bill if they admitted they were at fault. I then decided
 to down grade to just internet and deal with Netflix and Apple TV rather than deal with them. The day
 I was getting my down grades I found out for the past 6 months that I was getting charged for like 4
 services I wasn't even getting and all they did was drop the amount that they charged forgetting that I
 was telling them and they were failing to listen. That they wouldn't take my calls and would hang up
 on me.
 Now I am on my last straw. I was on my computer this morning to see that the internet had went out. I
 knew I had to pay the internet today and had just got the money to pay them the night before i went to
 the bank to put in the money and looked at my bill at work to see that I was owing them double the
 amount than usual. Last month my services just STOPPED working and I called there tech line and
 they couldn't fix the problem for me. So they told me that they would send someone out to my house
 to fix my problem. The guy came over to my house to check my lines out the when I pulled in the
 driveway the guy was nice and said, ""Did you set this up like this."" I told him no, that the guy who
 installed my cable did it. He said it was all jacked up and wrong. He went to his car and put a new end
 on my cable line. I told him I was glad that he came and fixed the problem. Ever since then I haven't
 had any problems with my service. Now I understand why it would go in and out when it would storm
 at my house. It was a messed up line that they installed wrong. I got cut off this morning to see that
 my bill was double. It was double because they charged me a hidden fee of $70 that was NEVER,
 NEVER, EVER discussed for the tech coming out. I have been on the phone with comcast hold
 message with the symphony and the guitar since 4:16 and I have been hung up on, told to just pay it
 cause talking to billing isn't going to do anything about this pass due balance. Got hung up on billing
 and customer service reps 5 times already. I am still on hold and each call has been at least a 20-45
 min hold each time you get transferred. They do not care about me or how about there employees
 treat me."

 I can get a certain unknown percentage of my office complex to sign up as well. They are leaving the

 with their contract with the City of Atlanta, which I believe prohibits such ""cherry picking"". I wish to

94,"Today, 5/28/15, is the 6th time we've called Comcast regarding install of internet in my new home.
 What is worst of all is that I originally called on 5/12/15 to ensure proper connection and avoid
 disruption in my service. I was told it would be an easy switch that we'd be able to self install and
 there wouldn't be any problems. Definitely not the case. Internet didn't work as soon as we got to our
 house. It's been 7 days since I moved in and I still don't have internet, but more than that - I have not
 heard truth from ANY of the company's representatives - even supervisors. When you call them, it
 says, ""We make it easy for you to move to your new home. With convenient date selections to have a
 professional come to your home on the same day."" Such lies.
 The first time we called, we were told it is that our modem is no longer supported so we had to go out
 to buy a new modem, only to find that our internet STILL did NOT work.
 Since then, we've had 3 appointments set up for a dispatcher to come to our home; 1 of the
 appointments/calls, they apparently have no record of and 2 were no-shows. Thus far, we've spoken
 to 2 supervisors; one of which even gave us his personal phone # to ensure ""we are taken care of
 and treated properly"" and that a tech would show up. Still no show.
 Was about to post a bad review/note on Facebook to see if it would catch their attention, only to find
 negative posts on the ENTIRE page regarding Comcast's Customer Service. How is this okay? How
 can a company see no value in providing even the most basic level of customer service to their
 paying customers? In a world where endless options are available, it seems Comcast can only get
 away with this because there is almost a monopoly in the cable/internet industry with only 2 providers
 available.
 FCC - Comcast needs to be reprimanded and held to a higher standard of customer service. They
 cannot continue to get away with this.
 I just canceled my service."
95,"On several occasions the Atlanta Regional office (along with the Corporate offices) have scammed
 me by saying the I owe them money that I don't owe. In fact, disconnecting my services as of (05-29-
 15) and forcing me to give them a postdated payment from my checking account. However, I don't
 owe them any money
 In the event that later Comcast is involved in a billion dollar class action suit the business executives
 will get the money, but what about me the customer that they haven't taken money from, forced
 payment, and disconnected my services for no reason.
 I expect the FCC to address this issue now before it gets to class action because as a consumer I am
 sure I will never see a dime of the class action settlement.
 This has been a repeat pattern with Comcast of cutting me off for no reason and demanding payment
 before services will be restored. I am a student, work from home, and a rapper that utilizes the
 internet daily. By suspending me they are forcing me to make a payment of monies that I don't owe.

96,"Prior tenant for my new apartment failed to discontinue his Comcast service associated with my
 address. Proof of residency was provided to Comcast, however I have been blocked from obtaining
 internet service due to their refusal to supplant the prior tenant's account associated with my address
 with mine. Thusfar, repeated promises have been made that the issue has been resolved; however,
 after two weeks the issue has not been fixed. This has precluded me from obtaining internet, phone,
 and/or cable for my residence due to willful negligence by Comcast in resolving this issue. I need
 them to simply change the service account for my address to my name. No less than seven
 phonecalls, 4 emails, and one visit to a brick and mortar have been made by me over the past two
 weeks to no avail. The prior tenant can not be reached by either the apartment complex or Comcast;
 however apartment management has confirmed the change in residency and that no equipment from
 the prior tenant remains in the apartment and had notified Comcast of such. Please contact me for
 any additional information or documentation so that we may get the issue resolved. Thank you."
97,"I recently upgraded my internet speed to"" up to"" 100 mbs. I paid 10 additional dollars per month for this privilege. My intent/cable TV bill averages ~ 140.00 per month. Service became so spotty and slow that it became almost useless. Made multiple calls to tech support, replaced my wireless access point with a new one. Ultimately Comcast came out to my apartment complex, fixed the problem and charged me 70.00 to come out.
 I called tonight to inquire as to why. I called at 6:43 PM, and was offered the option for someone to call me back in 5-7 mins rather than stay on hold. I chose this option. When there was no call, I called back at 7:08. I stayed on hold until 7:15 PM, when they called me back. I stayed on hold another 7 minutes until 7:22. I voiced my displease and asked to speak to a supervisor and was denied this opportunity. I was told I was responsible for the bill because it was my problem. I asked why it was my problem when it was their damn equipment and was chastised for using foul language. I never got to speak to a supervisor, and was told she was in Florida and could't assist me.
 I sent an email to corporate, but based on their lack of customer service, I doubt I will receive a response. Google internet can't get here fast enough. This monopoly is awful. They don't care. There needs to be competition and they need to be forced to provide the service that I am forced to pay high rates for. AT&T can't compete with their speed. They know they are the only real game in town. Therefore they are unresponsive.
 I expect relief. I shouldn't have to pay 70.00 for them to repair their system. Let alone the poor customer service and the waste of my time. Unbelievable.

99,"In an age where Hulu, Netflix, Youtube are being streamed with customers forgoing cable purchases, Comcast has further identified a way to increasingly limit competition as well as exponentially increase cost of such goods by enforcing data caps to limit customer use to 250 or 300 GB, with each additional 50 GB costing $10; essentially customers are coerced into spending more money and/or purchasing other goods (such as cable) in order to mediate effects of what should otherwise be ""unlimited"" internet. As a student who is on a limited budget, the extra $30 to $40+ per month is outrageous when in reality it costs Comcast no additional money in regards to how much or how little internet I use. Extortion at best!

100,"I own my modem and did not request a modem from Comcast when I set up my service in April 2014. In September 2014 Comcast started charging me for a modem rental. I called them multiple times, and I chatted with a representative online multiple times, and every time they said they would remove the charges and refund me. The charges were never removed and I was never refunded anything. So I have been receiving this extra charge for 10 months.

101,"Comcast imposes a 300gb bandwidth cap on its residential internet users, and then charges $10 for every additional 50gb. However, the streaming of content via Comcast's own XFinity service does not count towards the cap. I believe that this is a violation of net neutrality.
 Comcast should not be allowed to impose these data caps.

102,"My family recently moved to a new apartment and decided to open a Comcast account. My wife spoke with the representative to get the account set up as I'd be moving ahead of her and would need to take care of getting things set up. She scheduled an appointment with Comcast to get our internet started the exact same day I'd be moving in. That morning I received a call from a Comcast technician asking about my appointment later in the day, and after a brief discussion in which I told him I already had all the necessary equipment personally and I just needed the line activated, I was told to cancel my appointment as a technician visit would not be necessary. After arriving at the new apartment I attempted to hook up to Comcast exactly as I should and found I had no service. I made multiple calls to Comcast and after roughly 90 minutes on the phone being bounced around and given all sort of incorrect information and suggestions I ended up at a manager who told me they'd have a technician out the in a few days. At the time the second technician was supposed to show up, the technician never showed and after multiple hours more of calling support, multiple supervisors, and multiple support technicians giving me blatantly wrong information and one all but calling me a liar, I got another service appointment set up and was told that I would not be charged for any of the 3 total technician visits, including the two no-shows. At this point I had been without internet for multiple days, all of which was impeding my ability to do my job, which I had repeatedly mentioned to Comcast was an issue and it was their technician in the first place that prevented my access to the internet. The final technician visit went smoothly and the technician even went so far as to show me on his data pad my file on the company where it blatantly stated that my apartment was not connected and a tech still needed to finish up the wiring. The tech they sent out completed the wiring and I was able to connect. Apparently this part of my file should have been available to all levels that helped me and further alerted me to the fact that either nobody at Comcast knows what they're doing or they just don't care and were trying to string me along until I stopped complaining. Now over a month later I'm finding that Comcast is still attempting to charge me for one of the service visits, despite their statement that they would not. I've attempted to reach them regarding my bill but have been hung up on by their system on multiple occasions. Unfortunately in my area Comcast is the only ISP that is able to offer the speeds needed for my work so I'm stuck dealing with their awful customer service and business practices.

105,"To whom this concerns
 I have had an very poor experience with comcast as an internet provider and their poor communication and lack of follow through is the worst customer service I have ever encountered. On Thursday June 11th I placed a call in which a customer service representative instructed me I could cancel my service at the end of the month and drop off my cable box at my convenience with continuation of my internet service. The following day the box was turned in and to my surprise they discontinued my internet service as well. When I called they said it was because I did not pay my bill (though I am on auto-pay). Over the next two days I spent 3-4 hours on the phone and no one was able to re issue my service. They said they would call yesterday and no one has contacted me. Being that I work at the hospital and manage patient care it is extremely important that I access patient records during any time of the day or night. Because of this inconvenience it has caused a lot of problems for me.

 I have had service with Comcast for years now and suddenly this month they are saying that I have surpassed my data limit and trying to explain why I will be charged hundreds of extra dollars due to this.

107,"Comcast- Xfinity.com
 Atlanta, Georgia
 On May 16 2015, I tried to sign for high speed internet service. Unfortunately, I was told that the service was unavailable. It was a big surprise that in Midtown Atlanta in a street where my next door neighbor has the Comcast Xfinity connection, I could not have the same service.
 I called (800) 934-6489 and the time spent on the phone was 58 minutes. After I answered so many questions without success, the person on the line asked the supervisor who also gave the same result that service was unavailable at my house without explaining why others on the same street have service.
 The person from Comcast recommended Charter as alternative. Charter mentioned that Xfinity is supposed to have the service. They recommended I should go to the store and present a utility bill to and my lease to the property. I went the Xfinity store and opened a ticket (erone 029015327). It requested that a technician check the area and tell me an answer. The nightmare started. I gave enough days to see it was solved. I never saw a person or received a call. I called back and the answer was that the ticket was closed. The Xfinity representative Kenyata (I.D. mo-inkinley) reopened a ticket, but again nobody showed up.
 On May 21 2014 I decided to give another call, and after 37 minutes Andres (I.D. acampo 033), did the same thing, but he mentioned that now the technician was supposed to come and check the situation. He said that in 15 minutes he would called me back to decide in which program package I was interested. He never called back. I have read many reviews that Comcast Xfinity has a terrible service. At this time I can agree that all the information spread on the internet is real. It is terrible that they lie and treat me as a second class person. I am frustrated that nobody is there to provide help.
 Last week a person from Comcast Xfinity parked in a van on Westshire Place gave me a better answer. He said that my house has a “TAP BOX”, and should be able to have a high speed connection. He could not solve the issue because it was not his division, but he said that will make (b) (6)
 the request to his supervisor. Nothing came out. Today another technician, whom also I found working near the area, came to check the pole outside the house. Again, he said that there is a tap box to connect, but he could not do anything, because work required a ticket. He did not know who to contact at Comcast Xfinity
 Because the lack of response of Comcast Xfinity, and there is no way that I can directly request that a technician visit the site,I will really appreciate it if you will help to resolve the problem to obtain an internet connection.

108,"I ordered Comcast cable and internet service in late April 2015, to be installed at 2450 Camellia Lane NE #1359, Atlanta, GA 30324. Comcast was supposed to mail me the equipment for self-installation, but I did not receive the equipment. I called again three weeks later, and Comcast gave me the run-around, telling me to file a claim with UPS and wait for that to clear up, which I did. Comcast finally resent the equipment a week later. The equipment Comcast sent did not work. I had to drive to a Comcast location and pick up functional equipment myself. I was able to install it, but I requested that my bill be modified to reflect that I did not have working Comcast equipment or service for over a month. A Comcast representative told me she would change the bill at my request and prorate the billing cycle to reflect the days where I actually had working Comcast equipment and service. However, this month I received a new bill with a past due amount plus a current due amount and a late charge. I want to understand the bill, because I believe Comcast made a mistake and added on the amount for the time period where I did not have equipment or service. I've called Comcast more than 10 times to speak to a representative. Every time I call, I get an automatic message that I have an unpaid balance -- I then request to speak to a representative, and Comcast then hangs up on me. I've called from a cell phone and a landline, so I know the problem isn't my cell phone dropping the call. I've only been able to speak to a Comcast representative by selecting a service other than the option to discuss my bill -- I was able to speak to a Comcast representative twice by selecting the ""Pay Your Bill Now"" option and the ""Add Services"" option. Each time I told the representative I wanted to discuss an error on my bill, they hung up on me. And since my bill is unpaid, my internet service cuts off frequently. It basically appears that Comcast is purposely not allowing me to speak to a representative about my bill unless I pay the full amount first, which, again, I believe is in error. And it seems like Comcast is purposely making my internet service fail while the bill is unpaid (since I had no problems before the bill was past due). At this point, I want my bill to be fixed, so that I can pay the amount due and cancel Comcast. But, again, the Comcast customer service line hangs up on me every time I call.

110,"I have had three different issues trying to get my TV/Internet hooked, each more egregious than the one before it.
 The initial issue was that the sales person on the phone told me that I could use a home install kit, which was cheaper than getting the in home installation by an employee, even though it was a newly built home.
 Secondly, when I found I couldn't home install, they set me up for installation in my home and they basically told me that they could not credit me the cost of installation, but they would note my record. After receiving the first bill, I could call into billing and they would refund me the cost of the installation. I later spoke to someone in the billing department that said they would not honor that and I would not get refunded that if I called in after the first bill. The supervisor in Sales that told me I could get installation refunded had to know there was no way for me to actually get it refunded. I called back in to Sales, and the rep was able to refund me the installation cost (even though the previous supervisor said they could not do it).
 The final issue (and the most unbelievable) had to do with the actual installation. I purchased my own cable modem new from Amazon. When the installation tech showed up, I was not home but my dad was. He told my dad that the modem I had could not be activated on their network because it had previously been active. In addition he ""called"" into tech support and read the number out to ""someone"" on the other end of the phone call. He confirmed he could not activate it. He basically made us rent a cable modem from him.
 I did not understand this at all at the time, but trusted the guy enough to have Amazon send me a new cable modem. I decided to then call Comcast tech support and the support rep didn't understand why the intall rep would say that. He said that previously being on the network (if true, which it wasnt) was not a reason the device couldnt get on the network. he activated it with me over the phone in 10 minutes without issue. It is obvious that the install tech was lying and trying to upsell the cable modem. But he blatantly lied to us about it. The device was new and had never been on the network and even if it had, that was no reason for it to be an invalid modem. He obviously made some sort of a fake call to ""sell"" the fact that we had to rent a modem through Comcast. I have talked to a couple honest folks throughout this process, but also a couple that flat out lied to make a sell.

Before the upgrade my speed had never been higher than 2.2Mb/s(17.5MBPS) and now my speed with the upgrade has never been over 2.4Mb/s(19.2MBPS) with it consistently and daily having this speed dip down to 150kb/s(1.2Mbps) for hours on end as well. I assumed that I would at least have these peaks and lows increase by a factor of 2.4 since I'm paying twice the price that I was paying. There have been no noticeable speed increases and my account is obviously throttled at peak times by a factor of 60. Congestion is not acceptable excuse for this since my internet becomes completely unusable almost daily. Also, the xfinity wifi is being broadcast from my modem after already being disabled once through my account. Now when I try to change it again to be disabled, an error appears not allowing the change no matter what device or network I do it from. Support told me that they changed it when i talked to them about it and it never has been fixed and is still broadcasting a public signal. This is unacceptable because if congestion is my problem, I should easily and freely be able to prevent others from accessing my overloaded access point. Furthermore, the other week I received a letter that my service is going up in price due to factors in my area, which is unacceptable because I was not even receiving the service I was paying for,

115,"Comcast is testing a data cap program in Atlanta, which amounts to artificially restricting the amount of data accessible per month. This practice runs contrary to not only most other markets and most other ISPs, but also against all other common utilities. I believe this company is only permitted to preserve this clearly self-serving standard due to its effective monopoly in the marketplace.

117,"Over the past year, Comcast has been rolling out data caps for internet users in the Atlanta area. With other services, this would mean switching from this now very limited vendor to another without said restrictions. Unfortunately, Comcast has a monopoly over internet services in the Atlanta area. It appears that Comcast is putting these caps in place in order to push consumers away from bandwidth-intensive streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video and towards traditional cable television provided by - you guessed it - Comcast. The only consolation offered by Comcast is to sign up for one of their business plans which coincidentally have lower bandwidth/speed (making them unfriendly to those same video streaming services) despite their lack of data cap.

119,"I have had comcast internet for a while, and up until this year I have never had any issues with how much data I have used. Recently I went over the allotted 300GB data per month, which I would assume is due to a backup for my onedrive account. There was no charge, as they give users 3 courtesy overage months at no charge. However this month I have somehow gone over my 300GB data plan WITHOUT a large onedrive backup from the previous month... which has NEVER been an issue for me. They are saying I will be charged for usage of additional data. To my knowledge I should still have 2 courtesy overage months left. They have made zero effort to give warnings on data usage until its to late.. aka at 100% usage. This does not seem very fair.

 Hi,
 (b) (6)
 I just received a letter in the mail that was also sent to the FCC about my complaint. They are claiming they called me on July 1, 2, 9th in their letter in the second to last paragraph and I have no record in my phone or on my Verizon statement of these calls at all. The only ones I received were of notifications on my data usage and they are all automated and then hung up when they were done with the recording. ""The technician"" never called me from what I see on my Phone. I have received junk calls about opening a business and starting a website and that is it...not one call from Comcast.
 I called Comcast today in regards to
 my account because I had been given a credit of $20.00 for this month when my bill was due. It was only $24.99 instead of $44.99. It would not allow me to pay more than the $24.99 because it said that was all I owed. Today when I went to check my bill for August it said this:
 >
 The $20.00 Credit was not only removed from my account, but they decided to tack on a late fee as well for a bill I was not even late. I would have never known about them
 Taking the credit back until I went to pay my bill. I called and complained because I feel I had every right to and they told me it was a ""one time courtesy"" bill adjustment. That is not a courtesy to my understanding when you take back a credit, add on a late fee and then not call or email the customer to explain anything! It is terrible customer service and not right to do to loyal customers at all!
 I called Byron Darby in the number provided on the letter reading the statement in the letter about trying to
 Contact me on the dates above which I have no record of in my phone or on my Verizon statement...I told him I would like to be provided proof of that. I also do not think it is lawful or right to apply a credit to a customers account and then take it back without warning and then charge a late fee because the payment was not seen as accurate without the credit, even if they had done so by mistake or did not mean to apply it.
 Thank you for addressing my concerns and for your quick response.
 Sincerely,"
120,"I would like to file a formal complaint about the ever-increasing cost of my comcast service. I have been a comcast customer for several years at multiple properties mainly due to my lack of options. The monopoly that comcast is able to retain in some areas is unfair to the consumer and should be stopped. Admittedly, I do not 'NEED' cable but I work from home which mean I do 'NEED' the internet connection that I pay comcast for. I have attempted to cancel my cable subscription and keep only the internet but comcast insists on RAISING my bill if I drop the cable and only keep internet. Their logic makes no sense and their customer service is absolutely terrible. This is a common feeling among many comcast customers and I hope it is one day addressed.

124,"On June 12, 2015 I signed up for Comcast internet service for the first time (new customer) via the Comcast website. I signed up for a promotional internet offer for their ""Performance"" package (25 mbps) for $24.99 for the first 12 months.
 On June 22, 2015 I received my first bill for the service and noticed I was being charged $66.95 for the internet service instead of $24.99 as stated when I signed up. I called Comcast to address this issue and have had limited success in getting it resolved. After no fewer than 8 calls to Comcast customer support, I was redirected between the sales, online sales, billing, retention, and technical support departments, with each one telling me variations of the following: ""the offer is no longer available, [our department] can't fix this issue you need to contact [other department], we don't see the offer in our system so we cannot change your price, we can offer you another [more expensive] bundled internet and TV package, we can offer you a [slower] service for the same price"", and so forth.
 I have spent 5+ hours on the phone with various departments at Comcast and have still had no success in getting them to honor the rate I was told when I signed up for the service. I refuse to pay $41 more per month than I was told. I was either deliberately misled about the price of the service or Comcast is simply refusing to honor their own offers, either of which is unacceptable.
 I have attached screenshots of the offer I signed up for from the Comcast website, the terms and conditions of the offer, and another screenshot showing that the offer is for my address, clearly showing that the offer was valid at the time I signed up, for the specific service I signed up for, and offered at my specific address.

 However, I was out of the United States at May 06 to China and come back at May 22. I was bring my laptop with me, so it is not possible that I used that large amount of data.
 Second, Comcast has mandatory Internet usage notification through my email account, which I received at March and I turn internet off in time to avoid the charge. However, Comcast didn't send me the notification email, which they should automatically, to inform me that it is out of usage limit.
 I called Comcast Costumer service more than 5 times, and their costumer service agents were not helping. Even when I asked one of agents, ""so I have to pay for the data that I never used? "" He answered me. "" Yes, sir. If Comcast charge you on the bill, you have to pay for that. We can't do anything about the rest.""
 Since they do record the phone for the business purpose, it should be easy to check the phone record.. the phone refer number is 654430.
 In the attachment, there is screenshot for my comcast email list. You can tell at the end of line it is internet usage notification email at March, and there is no further notification from May. If they think I delete the notification, they can pull out the email database at their side to check the email log, to figure out why they didn't send me the notification and charge me the additional usage.

The last two months I've been charged for going over a data cap that was not properly advertised to me, it is hidden in the terms on their website. A data cap adversely affects a consumers basic need for the internet. Using the internet at the average speed that I get, Comcast only provides me with 15 hours of internet usage per month included in my monthly bill before I am charged an additional $10 for every 2 and a half hours of additional internet. I telecommute as often as possible, both because I am disabled and driving is painful, and to save money. This is no longer a viable option with being charged impossible hidden costs.

129,"Last year, Comcast notified us that we were going to have data caps of 300gb per month. These caps were only applied to certain markets and we happened to be stuck in one of the affected areas. Comcast 'graciously' allowed us to have three months where we could go over the caps per year. We used our three months in 2014 but have yet to receive any credits this year. Our monthly bill should only be approximately $55 per month and sometimes we are paying twice and even three times as much because we are not receiving the waivers that we were promised.
 My wife and I recently made the switch to Comcast business service which is significantly slower and more expensive. Even that process was a hassle. The first sales representative that we spoke with lied about not being able to give us the lowest price that was being advertised. She repeatedly stated that the offer was no longer available in our area. I checked their website two weeks later and the offer was still being advertised. I finally was able to speak with someone that would sell me the least expensive service.
 Now that I no longer have Comcast residential service, I would like to see if it is possible to be reimbursed for the three months that we went over on our data caps.

 The Comcast representative proceeded to tell me that I could have 25Mbps more for the same price (75Mbps total) however, it would require a new modem. He processed the order and I hung up. I did receive a UPS tracking number via e-mail the next day to track my package.
 The package arrived today and after I opened it, I discovered that it was a Digital to Analog video set top box and that I had been signed up for new TV service through Xfinity.
 At no time did I ever bring up TV service nor did I authorize this Comcast representative to sign me up for TV. This is a clear cut case of slamming/cramming.
 I just hung up with Comcast customer service and was told that the 75Mbps plan existed and did NOT require a new modem and it was $1 more per month than my old plan.

133,"Started Comcast service on January 2nd. During initial installation I told the technician that I had my own modem to use. The technician could not get the modem to ""sync up"" for some unknown reason. He instead installed a Comcast provided modem, for a $9 a month charge. On March 9th I returned the leased Comcast Modem to the Xfinity Store at 3637 Peachtree Rd, Atlanta, GA and installed my personal modem (it synced perfectly). Upon receiving the April bill, it still showed a $9 ""Modem Lease"" charge for the month. I called in and had notified them that I had purchased my own modem. I gave them the identifying information for both the returned modem and my personal modem. June bill showed a credit for 3/9 to 5/1. However, a new ""Modem Rental"" charge appeared for 5/15 to 6/1 for $5.80. I called in to complain, once again stating that I own my modem, and once again was offered a credit. The most recent June bill showed a credit, yet once again for the third time I was incorrectly charged a ""Modem Rental"" fee for 6/19 to 7/1 for $4.33. Upon calling in I was told that I must prove that I did not have a Comcast Modem, and that they don't have any information on the returned or personal modem. However upon logging in the online account management you can clearly see my personally owned Motorola SB6121. This is beyond ridiculous.

134,"I only have internet service after dumping xfininty for overpriced cable service. Now I only have internet with them. The price of this service has been $44.99 for 5 months, then $49.99 for two months and $54.99 last month. When I called xfininty, the rep said it was about modem that is mine not theirs, then my credit, then something about blast and discounts taken away. I was told that this is just what my bill is going to be. I want my bill to be $44.99 like it was. Nothing has changed. The service is the same. Xfinity should have competition and not be the monopoly that it is.

Due to strict data caps being implemented my last bill was $220. This is only in the southeast. My bill is supposed to only be $110 before they stack on data cap fees. The $110 is only for their lower tier service also. My internet runs poorly and they still charge me double for terrible service. I've called multiple times and they won't do anything so I'm asking you guys to help get through to them. This can't continue. I could get a small apartment for what they're charging me.

137,"For years now, I have lived at my current residence . Attica, Mi, 48412) and have been unable to access the Internet except through satellite internet or through a cell phone signal (mobile data), both of which have incredibly expensive data plans, low data caps (even for the most expensive plans), and are a prime example of the most abhorrent price gouging existing in any industry; now of course even more abhorrent due to the net neutrality being declared. Myself and those in my area have been denied the right to fast, reliable, cheap, and (most importantly) unlimited internet, which has become a necessity in the current day and age for work, movies (of which about 4 or 5 can be viewed each month through great difficulty and then having no data left on any capped plan), video games (with a 6GB cap and most games by themselves being downloaded exceeding that number on their own, not to mention playing games online) and general browsing for news, information, entertainment, etc. The current un-availability of affordable, uncapped, reliable, and reasonably fast internet in my area in unacceptable and is an example of extreme discrimination of those in rural and semi-rural communities. Corrections to this would be well over-due, but now is better than never. Thank you for your time,

138,"We recently moved to Georgia, and used to have a great company named charter, but we couldnt get them where we live because Comcast owns all the lines, so we stuck up with Comcast, and when are near our data limit, which if we pass over it we just have to pay for the how much we went over, which is very stupid because we live in 2015, there shouldnt be ANY data caps or limits. When we are at about 75% they start throttling it, hard. Download speeds are super low and we have their 50 mb/s and we almost NEVER actually get 50 mb/s to begin with. It gets VERY hard to accomplish anything online because of this, I use internet quite a lot so seeing their throttling for the past month and a half has been unprofessional because of the high prices for their service, I have tried everything possible on our end, so it has to be on theirs. Enclosed, I have left a screencap of the speeds we get quite often believe it or not, and we are paying for 50 mb/s. Also real quick note, it took 10 minutes to upload this one sceencap.

141,"I believe Comcast (Xfinity) has been and continues to engage in anti-competitive pricing based SOLELY on the amount of competition that currently exists a given area. I have had Comcast internet service in several locations, most recently in Seattle, WA and Auburn, WA. Recently I logged onto Comcast’s website to see what kind of deals they had going on, and due to Comcast NEVER fixing a glitch in my records where my Seattle, WA address was still (even 2 years and MULTIPLE complaints later) showing up as the default address on my account, even though my Comcast service ONLY goes to my Auburn, WA address I was able to see what deals were available for me to purchase at BOTH addresses. I pay 66.95 a month for 50Mbps (Performance) service in Auburn, WA where there is really no choice in ISP’s (Century Link DSL is not something I consider competition in any sense of the word)…if I wanted to upgrade my service to the “Blast” service tier (105Mbps) it would cost me $78.95 a month. If I try to order service for the Seattle, WA address (where there are a number of ISP options) I can get a “Performance Promo” deal that is 105Mbps for $24.99 for 12 months, “Blast” tier service (105Mbps) for $29.99 for the first 6 months, or get standard “Blast” tier service for $65.95 a month. So basically around 20 minutes away from me I can get service that more than DOUBLES my current speed for LESS than I pay now. In fact living where I do the next lower tier in service is “Performance 25” which is 25Mbps service for $61.95…so I can get HALF the service for $5 less…nice Comcast.

This second collection agency has submitted the debt to 1 or more credit reporting bureaus. This has now resulted in a negative impact to our credit and stands as blatant defamation of character as we no longer able to receive loans based on the significant impact this has made to our credit standing.
 This is not the first case of this issue and is just another testament as to how comcast attempts to use their resources to extort its customers for money.

145,"I get charged, on average, $50 in overages per month. I feel as though 300Gb is not nearly enough in today's high-bandwidth world. I have noticed an increase since testing Windows 10 at home, as a member of the Microsoft Insider testing group. Each time a new build is released it downloads a DVD worth of data to upgrade the machine to a new build. I am testing it on two machines (desktop and tablet) so effectively I get hit with double the usage each time it happen. On top of that I am a cord-cutter purely because Comcast refuses to release an application for XBox One which is the only device I choose to use for media streaming. Worse, systems like XBox One now employ completed downloaded games instead f physical media so games that are 15Gb or larger can be downloaded frequently. 300Gb simply isn't enough anymore, so if caps are going to continue they need to raise them. Worse, I understand that this cap is only implemented in select areas, so why am I being punished because Comcast wants to test something they aren't even imposing everywhere?
 Mobile Devices + Application Testing + Gaming + Hulu + Netflix + Showtime Anywhere + HBO Go + Amazon Instant Video + Steam
 I don't download torrents or anything. I will be the first to admit that I have done this in the past, but there is so much available now via streaming I have no need to do this. Yet I pay through the nose anyway...
 Someone needs to do something. I am in an area with no alternatives other than Comcast and I feel like I am being punished for using them. As we speak I am working on enabling SNMP on my router, so that I can track my usage using PRTG in order to identify my actual usage compared to what Comcast says I use. I am also engaging WOW (formerly Knology) to see what I can do to get them into my neighborhood.

A Netflix movie can be up to 4 gigs not to mention watching hulu and YouTube. This practice is unfair and does nothing to improve the bandwidth in our area since they just charge you more for using more internet. The bandwidth is still throttled when allt of people are on in one area. The data caps in the area are unnecessary and need to go away, seeing they are not in all areas

This would seem to be false advertising for services they don't cover/offer. I have never heard of a major company purposely not honor the online contract that is shown. In the end I was told they can offer me 50 mb for 49.99 for 6 months. I even have a printed copy of the site and what it read.

 I called to speak to them recently and they basically told me there is nothing else they will or can do to remedy my situation.

152,"The cost of internet service has gotten ridiculous. Why does the rate per month go up so high? Face it, it is not a symmetrical line it is an oversold shared broadband connection. Don't get me started on the service when needed. They have a problem, and then try and charge me to fix their problem. I spent hours on the phone to get those charges taken off. Bandwidth is cheap, yet they now have imposed a cap on traffic. I bought the service as an unlimited, they think sending out a notification solves their responsibility.

 FCC,
 We do not provide internet access, nor is this our customer. I believe this person used the word “Bandwidth” capitalized at the start of a sentence in the generice sense and absolutely nothing to do with our company.
 Please close this and remove it from our profile as tied to Bandwidth.com, Inc.

155,"We are a small business customer of Comcast. For more than 2 years we had persistent issues of video quality (mostly Skype) being at dial-up quality, even though we were paying for 100mb+ service. All the speed tests passed, which made it suspicious that only one type of traffic wasn't being delivered. After complaining to a national-level VP, they suddenly ""found a setting"" that instantly fixed the problem. It was so very obviously someone got a call from the boss to turn off the throttling. Clearly, these illegal controls are one of their standard practices. We have emails and voicemails to back it up.

157,"Comcast (Xfinity) prices their Internet service so that it costs MORE than their Internet & TV bundle,
 forcing/coercing customers to sign up for TV service. This pads the number of Comcast's cable
 subscribers, which I feel is dishonest.
 Further, they force subscribers to take possession of a cheap cable box. If the subscribers return the
 cable box to Comcast, Comcast will cancel the bundle pricing, and the customers' pricing will revert to
 the higher Internet-only price."
158,"In February of 2013, I ordered a Comcast triple play package. The wireless service was never
 hooked up incorrectly - the 2nd technician that came to my home told me my router was bad, so I
 purchase a new router. The third technician that came to my house, as my wireless didn't work
 either, told me that my wireless had been programmed to WLAN instead of Wifi. I was charged for
 over a year of wireless that I didn't receive."
159,"I signed up for a full-featured xFinity account for a newly purchased home we were remodeling last
 August, including phone, internet, tv and security. Service was good for 4 months until Comcast
 decided to upgrade their systems requiring them to dig from across the street and then burrow to my
 outdated property connection. My service was halted with this construction and never properly
 restored despite numerous calls from me, visits from technicians and promises from customer
 service and management. In the meantime, monthly bills continued to arrive with no
 acknowledgement from Comcast Billing that a problem existed. As you have probably heard before,
 the technical end of their enterprise never seems to communicate with sales. I currently have, after
 several months of no service, an orange cable line on top of my driveway providing no bandwidth. I
 was and still am eager to have their service since we do not move into the remodel for another week.
 I have in recent weeks been in contact with Jerry Biggs, a Kitsap County Operations Manager (253-
 896-5681), and he has been of some help in trying to get the installation reorganized and begun
 again, but my confidence has waned. He like others does not seem able to cut through the seeming
 morass of Comcast and their sub-contractors. Meanwhile I am constantly pestered by Comcast via
 phone and mail to pay my outstanding bill which I will not do. I will resume payments when I have
 service as promised."

163,"On December, 12 2014 I called Comcast to get internet for my business
 in Florida. I spoke with Noel Rivera. I told him I would be moving my
 business at the end of March 2015 so I just needed service for 3 1/2
 months. He told me that would be very expensive, but if I signed a 2
 year contract it would be much cheaper. I told him I did not want to
 sign a contract as I would be moving. He said when I moved I could
 transfer my service to the new location under the same contract. I
 told him where I was moving to was not serviced by Comcast - it was
 serviced by Time Warner. He said Comcast was buying Time Warner so it
 would be no problem to transfer my service. I still did not want to
 sign the contract, but he assured me it would be no problem to
 transfer and I should contact him directly when it was time to do that
 and he would personally handle it. He gave me his direct phone number
 and email address and so I signed a 2 year contract.
 Toward the end of March when it was time to move I emailed and left
 voice mail with Noel multiple time and never received a reply. Then I
 called the main number and spoke with a woman who's name I did not
 get. She said Comcast did not buy Time Warner so I could not transfer
 my service, but since I was moving to an area not serviced by Comcast
 I would not be charged a termination fee. She told me to return my
 equiptment to my local Comcast store and my account would be
 terminated. I did that and moved.
 After a couple of weeks I realized I had never received a final bill,
 so I logged on to the web site, saw I had $220 balance and I paid
 that. It then said I had a $0 balance.
 A few weeks after that I received, on the same day, a bill from
 Comcast for a $1,992.75 termination fee, and a letter from a
 collection agency because that fee had be charged off and sold to
 them.
 I immediately called and spoke with Donte Fisher. I told him all this
 and he said he would have the termination fee removed. He sent me an
 email with his contact info and he said he would call me back that day
 when it was removed. Later that I day I got an email from him saying
 the termination fee would not be removed. I called and left voice mail
 and sent email but he never replied.
 I then called the main number and spoke with a Rhonte Rose. He said if
 I sent him a copy of my businesses' lease in my new location that was
 not serviced by Comcast he would have the termination fee removed. I
 did that and received no reply. Again, multiple emails and voicemails
 were not answered. Called the main number again and I got Carl Nunoo.
 He said Rhonte had rejected my lease because it said ""Sample lease"" on
 the top. I had not noticed this. I contacted my landlord and she said
 she printed the lease off the internet and neglected to remove that.
 She sent me a new lease with ""Sample"" removed. I called the main
 number again and spoke with a woman who's name I did not get. She said
 to send the new lease to Rhonte with that explanation. I did that.
 Once again, multiple emails and voicemails were not answered. I again
 called and I was told that my new lease was also rejected but they did
 not know why. I asked for a supervisor and was told none were
 available. After insisting and insisting they went to get a
 supervisor. I was on hold for 25 minutes and then I was told a
 supervisor would call me that day. Three days later I have not
 received a call back.
 So to summarize, I was coerced into signing a long term contact with
 information that was not true. I was told by 4 Comcast employees that
 I would not be charged a termination fee and I was. I was promised
 callbacks by 4 Comcast employees and I never got them. And now I am
 saddled with a $2000 bill that has been turned over to collections and
 is affecting my credit score.
 Even for Comcast, who is known for horrible customer service, this is
 egregious. I sincerely hope whoever gets this can help me.

164,"To Whom It May Concern:
 I am writing in regards to a bill from Comcast that has been forwarded to collections. I will start at the beginning of my story. I decided I wanted to have Comcast in my home. I called them and set up a time for them to come on 3/20/15 between 9-11 am. After numerous calls to Comcast a gentleman named Nathan came around 2 pm. He was UNABLE to hook up my internet because it was disconnected at the pole. He told me he would come back with a ladder. After numerous phone calls and him not returning I called to cancel the entire service. After a length phone tree, they stated that I would receive no bill as my service was never hooked up and to return the router to the nearest Comcast store which I did the following day. They stated again how I would receive no bill. First I received a bill for $128.69 with billing date of 3/21/15. I called Comcast and the recording stated I had zero balance. I then received a bill for $62.60 with a billing date of 4/7/15. I then called and spoke to a billing representative who stated she would place the request for the refund into her supervisor and it takes 24 hours to process. I called the following day and was informed that there was a still balance so I asked to speak directly with someone who could refund this money. I did and they informed me I would receive a zeroed bill in the mail. I called the following day to confirm that the account had no balance and they informed me that it still did have a balance. I asked to speak to a supervisor who assured me he zeroed my bill. Later that day I got a call from a collections department on behalf of Comcast and the amount of $62.60. I called and spoke with Mia Thompson the head of the billing department at Comcast who stated all she could do was file a ticket with the restitution department who has to call me, but her computer was showing a zero balance. She stated she could not call them as they are not a ""call center"". She stated this process could take 7-14 days. I informed her that I was upset as to how this would affect my credit and she stated that there was nothing more she could do. I went to the Comcast Store in Nottingham MD and they told me the same thing. I am now writing the FCC in regards to this bill that has been forwarded to collections as I do not have confidence that they will communicate with the debt collection agency and that this will remain on my record/credit. I have never come across a company that has business practices so unethical to charge someone for a service that they have NEVER received. I implore that you contact them and mediate this issue on my behalf to ensure that proper communication occurs between Comcast and this debt collection agency and that this does not negatively impact my credit. I also am requesting a written letter once the issue is resolved ensuring me that this debt is not still outstanding with Comcast OR the debt collection agency.
 Thank you,

166,"Firstly, I had Comcast for about a year and a half in total going on two years in September. I started out with a package costing $79.99 with great channels available. The internet was very slow and it cut off in our area between 1-5 pm everyday for a couple of months last year (this was a major issue but at the time I thought it was just our apartment). A representative came in and fixed everyone's internet connection in the complex.
 As my deal expired, Of course the price went up after our first year and a rep advised me to get the triple play package just so the price would be cheaper. It would then be $99.99/per-month, I NEVER utilized the phone service, don't even know what the devices look like. I did it, and it was good for a while but then as certain prices were added on to the bill after 3 months(It was probably promo channels) that I was unaware of, I decided to discontinue the television services and KEEP the internet services.
 At this time, a representative came and picked up the cable box and had me sign an order to discontinue it and pay off the outstanding bill. All of this is fine. Given that I was paying for the services anyway while the services were temporarily disconnected because that is Comcast policy, I DID NOT COMPLAIN, I complied. As I kept the internet services, Comcast continued to bill me full price for triple play an additional channels which I WAS NOT receiving. As I was calling to rectify the situation I was bounced around and around to different departments and I was on the phone about an hour and a half trying to resolve this situation. NO ONE had a clear cut solution for me. Majority of my wait time on the phone was 20 mins wait for each department I was transferred to so do the math. I was incomplete disgust because I am a working, full-time student that depended on Comcast for this service. For all this, I could have just got a different more affordable internet service provider that would not have caused me all this headache over billing issues and service interruptions. I mainly disappointed with their ability to rectify the situation once I speak to a representative. Today, Monday April 27, 2015 would be third time I am calling COMCAST to rectify the same situation that I thought I fixed 3 hours and two calls ago.
 THIS IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE TO ANY OTHER FULL TIME STUDENTS THAT I KNOW. The ability to work things out once is unheard of here.

169,"Hi -
 I've been a Comcast customer for a couple years. Recently, I had forgotten what Internet speeds I'm paying for and I checked my bill and my online customer profile for this information. It was not there. It took me nearly 20 minutes dealing with a customer service rep online to learn my upload and download speeds.
 This is unacceptable. I did some research and contacted Comcast. They told me via Twitter and online chat that they only list the name of the Internet plan on customers' bills, but not the speeds they're paying for.
 This lack of disclosure is an undue hardship on a customer's right to fully understand the services they are paying for, and to easily compare Internet speeds and prices among providers in our area.
 Comcast will make all sorts of excuses about why this disclosure to the customer is not made. But they are excuses and do not address the ongoing damage and harm that the company is perpetrating on their customers' right to easily access vital information about their account.

173,"Many issues including:
 1. they do not disclose what Internet speed on the bill on our online account
 2. with cable tv, they give you a free offer for a specified period of time (6 month for example) and then start charging you for it after the free offer has expired
 3. billing - they say that if we drop home phone (we have triple plan bundle) our bill will go up, not down
 4. they have an exclusive contract with Baltimore City so we have no other choice since FIOS is not available in the city.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/10/2015 8:00:24 PM:
 Comcast got in touch with me by phone and email. They were willing to allow us to discontinue the triple play and lower the rates (rather than what they have always said, which is that the rates go up). We cancelled our phone and are saving about $50/month for a year.
 However, the model they use is not fair to the consumer, or sustainable in the long run. I do not want to pay for stations that I don't watch (for example all the sports stations) even though Comcast has to pay for them. We need an alternative to the monopoly that Comcast has in Baltimore, thanks to our short-sighted local government.
 Thanks for your assistance.

175,"I don't use my Comcast Internet for much more than streaming Netflix and the performance is consistently slow, causing the stream to drop its connection to Netflix or slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) buffer the stream then I will have maybe 30 seconds of poor quality video and then it will halt and buffer again. This happens at all hours of the day and when the service is ""working"" the quality of the stream is extremely poor. I am not downloading anything or watching streaming services on multiple devices, its' ONE device running in the entire apartment. The device is located within feet of the router, so I know it's not a range issue. These issues have occurred constantly since I signed up for service in January 2015. I would love to switch providers, but there are no other reasonable options in my area (Baltimore City).

176,"I am paying for high speed internet (27mbps or so) with Comcast yet I am consistently getting cut outs almost a couple times a week and slow downs where it consistently speedtests between 10-17 mbps. In fact my speed rarely peaks above 22mbps. My service has cut in and out and i still receive calls either direct from comcast or their third party representatives urging me to add additional services such as tv or phone even though i dont have a TV or a land line. When I have called for service, the wait has been days and on occasion during the diagnostic of a slow down, my service will shut down entirely. I have been told repeatedly that it is because I am not using a comcast modem and I should rent one from them and they will guarantee that it works for a monthly rental fee which would far surpass the cost of buying one outright. I'm just generally displeased and have been over my year and a half of service with them. If I am consistently only getting half the speed I am paying for, I should be paying half the price.

177,"Comcast is the only service I am able to use for internet in my Baltimore neighborhood. When I initially signed up I was ""forced"" into taking a package of cable and internet despite only wanting internet--the force was created by ridiculous package offerings where it actually costs more to receive less service. In my case, it originally cost $89 for cable and internet but would cost $99 for only internet. Now, after a year of that 'promotional price,' I am being charged $110 for the same exact service with no options to downgrade service to a lower rate per month. These monopolistic behaviors are in no way beneficial to customers.

181,"I am a Comcast/Xfinity Customer in Baltimore, MD who wanted to downgrade my cable services because of the high monthly charges. I went through several downgrades to see if I would actually save money and discovered that the company charged me $99.40 in unexplained charges after I downgraded and then refused to add an $8.00 sports package after I made payment arrangements that included my disputed charges. MOnty in the changes department said he would not waste his manager's time or mine by even calli them to the phone and refused to let a supervisor assist with the call. He said that I needed to pay my bill and that noboby on earth could lift the hold on my delinquent account. Mind you; I just paid the bill. This company has shown false advertising in packages and when you try to downgrade they hit you with hidden fees and unexplained charges then disconnect your service when you try to get the issue resolved. I am requesting an investigation and resolution of my billing dispute.

The service tech who was installing the home security said you are in a one year contract with them and you can cancel at anytime but you will be charge 200 dollars just for canceling it. We have had this service for over a year now and we do not need it. I have called several times speaking to people who work for comcast stating that we are not in a contract and yet for the past months we have charged 29.99 for service we do not even use. I told them over the phone that we are paying for something that we do not need and yet our bill continuing being over 600 a month. I am always getting a disconnet note without them even calling me. They want their payment on time but yet they do not want to even work with you. The home security people are rude especially Ms. Angie and the supervisor who worked on June 9. No one wants to be accountable for their action and they just pass the phone to different department. I am very upset because I have trying to get rid of this home security of the longest and yet I do not use it. It has been over a year and now Xfinity is saying I am in a 3 year contract with them. I did not sign for a 3 year contract and I told them there was fraud committed. I do not want this account any more and I have told them this specifically that it is fraud and I do have a police report. I want this account to be removed because I am paying for someone else. I want account the home security to credit my account but I want to keep the other services (phone, internet , cable).

188,"I initially called Comcast on Tuesday May 12 about my speed issues. Did some troubleshooting,
 checked signal levels, determined a tech visit was needed. Scheduled a visit for Saturday May 16
 between 8 AM and 10AM (nothing sooner was available). Come Friday afternoon, May 15, I called to
 VERIFY the appointment. I was informed no appointment existed. I got upset but remained calm and
 insisted a tech appointment be scheduled for Saturday May 16, I was told that he would put a request
 in and dispatch would call me in 2 hours. 3 hours later, still no phone call. I called back and insisted
 on speaking to a supervisor. Was told that none were available, but he can help. He told me he put
 an emergency request in, and provided me a ticket number (a CR number) and he promised he
 would call back in 10-20 minutes. An hour later...still no phone call. I called back and was very
 frustrated at this point. Once again, I requested a supervisor but none were available. He stated he
 put an emergency request in for me, provided me a ticket number (an ER number), and someone
 from dispatch will call me first thing in the morning. 9:45AM on May 16 comes and I finally get a call
 from dispatch. The person told me there is NOTHING available that day or sunday and that Monday
 is the earliest available slot. Explained my situation, and I got told ""Its either Monday or never, deal
 with it!"" And was then hung up on. I immediately called into customer service. and spoke to another
 rep. She says she can get me an appointment from 3-5pm that day (May 16th) and she promised me
 this. She placed me on hold and came back stating she was unable to get this appointment but will
 have someone from dispatch call me back. I refused the call back as after being told few times I'd get
 calls, and never called back I was leery of trusting yet another rep. I insisted on a supervisor at that
 point. She placed me on hold and came back and said no supervisors were available. I again,
 demanded a supervisor. She said she will have one call me back. I refused and again demanded a
 supervisor. She states that they're busy right now. I told her that was fine and I would wait. She
 placed me on hold and 15 minutes later a supervisor picked up. He promised to get a tech out by
 3PM that day (May 16th), and I would get a call by 1PM from dispatch to confirm the appointment. As
 of 2:00PM that day I never received a phone call. So I went outside and opened the comcast box and
 found the cable connections were very loose. After I tightened the connections, my issues are
 resolved. This complaint is for the lack of customer service I received. I should not have to climb on
 the side of my house to correct an issue a tech should have done. My only option for high speed
 internet is comcast. I do not consider AT&T's 6mbps DSL as ""high-speed""."
189,"I have attempted repeatedly on the phone with Xfinity (Comcast) to learn what exactly might be causing my data useage to approach/exceed the 300g monthly limit.

It went from being an extra 10$ a month for the extra speed, to 12$, with absolutely zero notice anywhere. Not even an email stating the price increase in the email Comcast gave me.
 Sadly the only other Internet choice out here we have is Century Link, Which is not a Broadband service. I would readily switch providers if i had a choice. Not only is their business practices shady, they have some of the worst customer service i have ever had.

 Comcast Cable Issues:
 1. We live in a resort town when population increases or during peak user times morning and evening, internet service gets slow and is spotty.
 2. Constant outages with no notification.
 3. When you call with a problem they expect you to work along with them to diagnose sometimes taking hours of your time to fix their equipment or service problem.
 4. If problem can't be fixed they charge you to send a technician $50.00 and call it an installation fee. I rent this equipment $10.00 fee for a modem. $2.99 fee for each digital adapter per month.
 5. They arbitrarily raise your bill without notification. Bills are impossible to comprehend.
 6. Service techs say they only get paid 15 minutes per call after 15 minutes, I had one tell me he couldn't fix it in that time frame, so he left and told me to call again.
 7. They quote you prices on the phone but when you get your bill, its more money.

 lost emails, comcast does not return messages. I have filed a prior complaint, ELS ticket # 02003200. I got a email response from Elaine Singleton and she asked me to call her at 302-731-3715. I have left 4 messages with her to call me back without a return call and now I have lost 95% of my emails from my comcast home page."
192,"I'm trying to downgrade my service from their triple play to the double play since I no longer have my phone service through them. Their web site offers deals for existing customers here: http://www.xfinity.com/upgrade-center/offers
 I tried switching to Preferred XF Double Play with a two year agreement for $89.99 and was told I couldn't even though the deal is supposedly for existing customers. I tried talking to a supervisor or manager and they said they'd have one call me shortly. That phone call never came.
 All I'm trying to do is order a package that they advertise on their site. The plan they customized for me was barely less than my previous plan and my old plan included phone service. I don't have any other Internet options in my area or I'd leave them.

193,"I received a call while at work. I answered and said hello. The voice on the other end then responded 142 and I asked her excuse me? She then responded you owe 142 on your Comcast bill, do you want to pay it now. I told her no not right now I will pay it on the same day I always do. She then said ""well I am going to put on your account that you are refusing to pay"" *click -- That was her hanging up on me. I have done 3 tours in the middle east for the USAF and I have never once been that disappointed/angry at anything. The absolute worst service I have ever had from any company. I need to know someone will look into this monstrosity of customer service. How did Comcast make it this far?

196,"I called Comcast to ask why my internet was running slowly. By the end of the conversation with
 them they told me they were going to transfer me to NETGEAR (the brand of router that I have)
 because everything was fine on their end. So they transfer me and I think I am talking to NETGEAR
 but I get charged $169.95 from an outside company for a 1 year warranty on my products.
 I see this as very unprofessional, and very wrong of Comcast to do. Telling a customer that you are
 transferring them to someone only to be transferred to someone else and scammed out of money is
 absolutely horrid."
197,"I live in Bedford, IN and just recently moved to a place which is apparently unserviceable by anyone
 other than satellite internet which wont work for us. I was told that I could get high speed internet
 before I moved in and apparently I cant. Comcast refuses to take my house seriously. Ive requested
 for them to look at our property and if they would they would see it would be profitable due to the
 hundreds of houses that are in my neighborhood. I like to play video games, my son likes watching
 youtube and my wife loves browsing and watching Netflix and hulu. The caps the satellite people offer
 are ridiculous because we could use that in a day! Gaming for me is the only way I can stay social
 with my friends anymore due to my job, I would love for someone to take my complaint seriously.
 We're in the 21st century where almost everyhouse should have access to broadband internet.
 Please help me!"
198,"I inadvertently git behind on my Internet bill. Wanted to make an arrangement to pay the whole
 amount but it was two weeks til my next paycheck. Was told they can only set it up a payment 7 days
 in advance. Was told to set payment up to come out May 11th and then call back before to change
 payment date. I was told this twice By two different people. Called billing back today and was told that
 since the arrangement is with a bank they can't change it and there was nothing they could do. I was
 lied to twice and then lied to again because I was not made aware of the disclaimer or read that
 information at the end of the call. Had I would have known that I wouldn't have done it. Now I will be
 out eveN more mobey I don't have because of their lies. They need to be held accountable for their
 deceptive practices."
199,"I moved in at , Bel Air, MD 21014 and signed up for Comcast Internet service -was promised that the payment will be $39.99 +tax +modem rental fee of $10 per months. I called Comcast twice and they confirmed the fee. But when I got a bill it was.... $100.54 per month fee. I called Comcast and was explained that ...it is legitimate fee that includes $50 hidden fee they did not say to me about while I signed up. No way to get the fee reasonable - I paid $30 per month for the Internet all time before, and here for very slow, very frequently non-working service - $100 per month - that unbelievable, Comcast lied from the first moment I contacted it with service request. Even they promised $20 for not arriving on time to arrange the connection - Comcast ""forgot"" about the promise. I very skeptical that government is able to support affordable and competitive Internet service in the country, even if in 70 miles from the National Capital Comcast can commit such fraud without any remorse and apologies. $100 per month for slow and not reliable Internet it is not what US citizen deserved supporting FCC for their taxes.

200,"1. TTB provides VOIP phones for users who work from home. These phones have connected successfully to TTB without issue for several years.
 2. Around the middle of the week of June 3, TTB IT received numerous calls that the phones could no longer connect. In the course of TTB IT troubleshooting it was found that the issue was only TTB employees with Comcast as their Internet Service provider. Users with all other Internet service providers do not have the issue – their phones continue to connect without issue.
 3. On further troubleshooting it was discovered that Comcast is intermittently blocking UDP port 443 and this is causing the VOIP phone to fail to connect.
 4. Users with an ISP other than Comcast see the following on a TTB broadband test

 Please close out this Complaint as being successfully resolved.
 Background shared by our IT operations on Problem Resolution:
 Last evening our IT Department was contacted by a number of Comcast personnel, including some superb network engineers. Interestingly enough, I believe the Comcast contact resulted from a TTB employee passing the information in the broadcast to someone they know who works for Comcast. That Comcast person escalated this issue to the correct people and that was the key to this problem being resolved. This is the second day running where a non-IT TTB employee took action that resulted in a problem resolution breakthrough. My thanks for your involvement and willingness to help!!
 This turned out to be an exceptionally complex issue. The Internet is really a series of interconnected networks, all run by different providers. For the TTB employees with the issue, their Internet traffic went from Comcast to at least 2 other providers before it got to TTB. The issue was actually UDP Port 443 (don’t worry what that is) being intermittently blocked/lost/whatever. This block happened not at Comcast but at one of the provider networks between Comcast and TTB. After we worked with Comcast for several hours, they dropped us off the call and went to work with the other providers and worked until the issue was resolved on our behalf. It was exceptional support by Comcast!

 1. Comcast support engineers contacted TTB OCIO personnel on the evening of June 8, 2015. Those personnel worked through the evening troubleshooting the problem. They followed up with us this morning to make sure the problem is resolved.
 2. Comcast determined that they were not blocking UDP port 443 either intentionally or due to a problem in their network.
 3. Comcast engineers traced the issue to another network between Comcast and TTB and worked with those providers to correct the issues.
 4. The Comcast support personnel that worked with TTB individuals and told you that UDP port 443 was not blocked by Comcast were in fact correct. A lot (not all) of the UDP port 443 traffic was blocked by another provider in the path between Comcast and TTB, but not by Comcast.
 5. Because the issue was outside of the Comcast network this was a difficult issue that could only be resolved with the level of support we received from Comcast last night. The Comcast engineers worked with the provider that had the issue and their efforts led to the problem being solved.
 6. The problem is resolved.

201,"I called on jan 30th approx to see if my home security contract was up and I was told I was not in one. So in feb on the 14th I cancelled the home security and in march got an early termination fee 600 dollars worth. So I call on March 16th stating what happened and requested them to pull the phone call. A week and a half later I call to see why there has been no progress they state that you have to call the call center the rep was at to have the phone call pulled (nice to know now). So they file an escalation ticket and I am all like okay on April 7th I call and the rep states he makes a note to have them call me ASAP. It is April 15th I have called they said they can do nothing except stating that I was in a contract and they told me this phone call that you have 60 days to turn it back on (even thiugh on march 16th she said it was 30 days and I was 2 days passed that deadline) and I almost agreed to turn it back on and pay the stupid 40 dollars a month. Except, I was told I was not in a contract and for a month no one bothered to call me back like they were supposed to. I have been a loyal customer to comcast for 4 years but next month I will pay them the dumb fee and then find a new provider as they are a bunch of lieing, cheating, money stealing, people.

 FCC team:
 Thank you for reaching out to Comcast Cable regarding continue Internet issues. I would like to add to the complaint that I have been invoiced $36 for the service call. According to Comcast policies, if the trouble shooting call is not related to in-house wiring nor the owners equipment, there is no charge for the service call. In this instance, the issue was related to an incorrectly configured Boot File. The Boot File to the modem is managed, maintained, configured and pushed out by Comcast systems. There should be no charge for the service call.
 I just finished talking to Bob at Comcast Billing and he refused to issue a credit for the service call.
 Who do I need to work with to eliminate the overcharges?
 Thanks, (b)

204,"Dear Federal Communications Commission,
 Comcast has been charging us twice every month with equipment rentals, a claimed $10/Wireless Gateway fee and a $10/modem rental fee, even though we only have 1 modem. This makes me wonder if we are being charged incorrectly or the bills mis-printed. The account is udner the name of my father and I am wondering how I or the FCC could take action on this.

205,"On 6/26/2015, Friday, between 12:45 am and 1:30 am PDT, I attempted to contact Comcast Technical Support at (800)934-6489 six times. First time I called, they answered then they hung up on me. Second time thru the sixth time, they didn't say anything. They just hung up the phone. I don't know what type of game those foreign assholes are playing but it isn't funny. Those foreign assholes have no consideration towards the customers. What is it going to take for Comcast to do something about those foreign assholes who are taking away job from Americans? A multimillion dollar law suit? Those foreign assholes that comcast has employed treat me like dirt. If I were comcast, I would fire the lot of them and give those jobs to red blooded Americans. I don't appreciate going into a call center 10,000 miles away in a foreign country. I am an American and when I call Comcast, I want to deal with an American only and not some ignorant foreigner that is located 10,000 miles away in some damn foreign country. If it weren't the fact that Comcast has a monopoly here, I would switch to another cable company. Comcast SUCKS!!!

206,"I pay for internet and cable services from Comcast. Part of my package I’m supposed to have full access to HBOGO. I also pay Sony for their PS Plus package so I have their new HBOGO app. Comcast is blocking my HBO access to this app. Ridiculous that I pay both companies for access and then they block the service.

207,"I am writing to inform you of my complete opposition to the data caps that Comcast intends to roll out for most if not all of its broadband subscribers. These caps are clearly a way for Comcast to increase revenue and having nothing to do with network congestion. Source: http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-trials-what-are-the-different-plans-launching
 I do not understand how they can charge me for both the speed of my connection and how much I use it. If they are charging me based on speed, I should reasonably expect that speed to be available for use most of the time. If they are charging based on consumption, then why limit speed. It seems to be a catch-22.
 My family utilizes our internet greatly in our daily lives. We stream music through publically available apps, do a good amount of gaming and stream most of our media through apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc. We also regularly backup our computers through the cloud, for security purposes. Despite this basic level of usage, we are still above Comcast's projected cap of 350GB on a monthly basis. This is with managing our network intelligently by limiting the quality of the streams we watch and turning off apps and services when not in use. Even Comcast's data estimation tool projects we will be well over the cap.
 The crux of my complaint is that they are able to do this because they do not have the fear of competition in the marketplace. Per the recent FCC decision defining broadband as 25mbs or greater, they are one of only 2 operators in our area that can offer that speed. If both of these operators decide to cap residential data (as they both want to), it creates a duopoly in the local market . This is not the best and highest use of our nation's broadband infrastructure, much of which is subsudized by public money.
 Please do everything you can do ensure this policy is not implemented, or the rest of the country will experience the disasters that have occurred in the communities where they have tested these data caps.

208,"I just built a home in a new subdivision in Raymore, Mo. Comcast has clients in the same subdivision already connected. I'm a current Comcast client and I had contacted Comcast before I built and they told me no issue on getting connected at my new location. Now they are saying they have no plans to connect me. They have used several excuses none of which are real. Their first excuse was they didn't have cable run to this area yet. I explained to them that wasn't true and gave them the address of the homes that are connected. The last one was they can't cross other peoples property to get to mine. There are utility easements on both sides of the road so there is no such issue. The neighbor right next to me has been trying to get connected as well. Another one further away in the subdivision was told they would connect him for $10000.00. That is stealing and I can't believe they told him that. They should be fined for suggesting they be paid such a crazy amount for them to provide a service which they are in the business of providing. There are no other choices here in Raymore for cable my understanding is Comcast is the only cable provider. They have this market, but yet won't provide the service. I was finally told I had to talk to their construction department which I have left messages multiple times and they say they will call you back within 24 hours and it has been weeks and no call back. They are terrible and if I had another choice I wouldn't even be trying to get their service but since they are the only one that can provide service in Raymore I have no other choice. Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. I can be reached at

212,"Numerous billing and service issues ever month and I have only been a customer since February. I
 left Comcast prior for the same reason and joined Verizon however I moved and Comcast happened
 to be the only service provider in my area. So against all reasoning I joined them and once again they
 provided the service I've come to expect from them. On top of the never ending problems when you
 finally get through to them you connected to a representative who english is sub par therefore a
 language and comprehension barrier occurs. They never fix your problem even though they say they
 have fixed it so you have to call back again to actually get the problem fixed the following month. I call
 to pay my bill and ask them the amount (which is never the same as whats posted online) and when I
 pay that amount I get a notice the next month because I was short $10 its so frustrating. They never
 connect you to a manager when you ask them to. It becomes very frustrating when all you want to do
 is enjoy your service and pay your bill.

218,"I have searched the Internet looking for a local Comcast number, or corporate number to call concerning the billing problem I am writing about, but have found nothing.
 This complaint revolves around unresolved Comcast Cable Billing, per the attached bill. I’m told by Comcast, this bill does not appear on my account and therefore they can’t view it. In other words they don’t know anything about how I got this bill. The attached bill reflects credits of $110 from Comcast ($212.55 less $110 in credit, leaving a balance of $102.55). The $102.55 was paid on time to Comcast. Since they cannot find this bill their position is that I owe for the total of $212.55 plus my normal bill amount. This is the essence of my complaint although there are service related charges detailed below.
 The telephone and internet component of my service has been going on and off for the last several months (sometimes several times per hour). Comcast has made repeated service calls (approximately 9 visits) replacing the modem, cables inside and out, splitters, ground wire etc. They also drilled a new hole in the outside of the house to ease the running of an interior replacement cable. After each visit, the telephone and internet service worked for a short period and then returned to the on/off cycle. After the last visit, an inside cable was replaced but he system still did not work and the technician said that sometimes just plugging the modem into another wall outlet would solve a problem. He did and the internet and telephone have worked since (I would think that would have been tried on the first visit).
 To Comcast’s credit they gave a series of credits on my last bills but still charged for replacing wiring inside the house (which did not solve the problem). The billing person I spoke to today, April 13, said she would submit a request for the wiring to be removed from the bill. However, I doubt this since, on April 5th I spent nearly 1 ½ hours on the phone trying to straighten out the bill. That person agreed that my bill should be adjusted and it would be updated within 24 hours. However nothing has been changed on the current bill.
 I have found the customer service people and technicians to be nice but typically, when reporting a service problem or trying to resolve a billing problem I am talking to someone in a far away land with less than good English and poor listening skills. To end, the Internet and telephone problem should have been resolved on the first visit i.e. plugging the modem into a different outlet. I have spent many, many hours talking to the billing department and being at home with the Technicians while they did hours of unnecessary work.
 Hopefully the FCC can intervene and help me resolve this billing problem.
 Thank you for your attention.

219,"I tried to get Comcast cable internet at my home. The home is near other homes which are receiving cable internet services. Comcast has avoided providing me with internet services for years. The company has offered excuses about service area and the type of telephone poles around my house in what I believe is an effort to avoid incurring the expense of providing me cable internet. Internet with reasonable speed has become akin to telephone as a utility. The only company in the area that will service me is Frontier Telecom. Frontier hasn't given me any difficulties as a customer, but in their advertising in the area they promise speeds of 6 MegaBytes per second. The plan I pay for states I could get 6 MegaBytes download speed. I currently only receive about 1.5 MegaBythes of download speed. The telecom companies in my rural area are abusing their customers and potential customers because of their oligopoly. Is there anything you can do to either force Comcast to meet my reasonable request to service the property, or compel Frontier to provide me with the speeds they promise in their advertising?

220,"Scheduled Comcast installation (bundle, phone internet, tv) for May 28th 3 wks prior. I called May 27 to confirm install & they said it was cancelled. That started my BP going in wrong direction! I called my comcast rep & he said he would try and get install asap for next day. That took several texts & phone calls! He even told me to call his supervisor & I placed several calls to him also. Tech came out on 29th and did half install, I was not happy. They had to come out a 2nd time. I have made over 50 calls to comcast since complaining that I will not pay my first month bill until I get some satisfaction. All they did was waive the install fee. My BP has been raised in the last 3 wks going through over 50 calls to get satisfaction for the pain & suffering they put me through. I should not have to call that many times to get what I deserve. I also called to speak to a director at a higher level & they put in a ticket #ESL01957453 on June 16. No call back yet. I am so frustrated with comcast to the point I wish I could get a different carrier, but I just moved to senior housing (after being on the wait list for almost 3 yrs) and had to move the end of May 2015. I had FIOS prior for years & they never put me through this ever in over 15 yrs. My first comcast bill is due Monday, June 22 & I have told them (at least 10 people) over the calls that I am not paying one dime til I get satisfaction. I am asking for the first month bill to be waived due to pain & suffering of what they put me through with no call backs. I always pay my bills and will pay comcast going forward, but not until I get the 2nd bill from them. If they threaten to cancel me, there will be justice! ALL I WANT IS MY FIRST BILL WAIVED AND I WILL BE A SILENT COMCAST CUSTOMER GOING FORWARD! If this does not get resolved in my favor, that first month bill balance can stay on forever, because it's not going to be paid ever! I hope you understand, I am 63 and don't need this as a first time customer. Someone dropped the ball and cancelled my install and I wish I knew who it was so I can get them fired!!!!! IT WAS NOT ME...ALL I DID WAS CALL TO CONFIRM MY INSTALL DATE WHEN THEY DROPPED THE BALL ON ME :(
 I AM ONLY ASKING TO WAIVE THE FIRST MONTH BILL. THE INSTALL FEE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR WHAT I WENT THROUGH, SEVERAL PHONE CALLS, TEXTS, AGGRAVATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, STRESS, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE!!!

 All they did was take off the install fee!!
 This has affected me mentally and physically due to my heart condition.
 Who waits til the day before to CANCEL MY SERVICE?
 May I ask why they won't be calling me instead of a mail response?
 Also I thought I made a copy of my complaint to you....is it possible to get a copy of my letter??

I called the technical support and they told me they will send someone on Monday, June 15, 2015 from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I stayed as home waiting for the technician, and at 4:44 pm a got a call from them to tell me the technician will be late and he will come maximum by 7:00 pm, so I agreed on that as I had no choice and I waited but nobody was showed up. I called and be surprised by an automated response telling me that my appoint rescheduled to Wednesday June 17, 2015 without any notes. After that the appointment rescheduled to Sunday June 21, 2015 after a long call with the customer service to complain. Unfortunately , I got a phone call today Saturday June 20, 2015 and they want to reschedule my appointment again which was a shock to me as I never expected that to happen after all my calks and complains with their customer services. To add to all of that, I received an email from Comcast on June 16, 2015 sending me a bil of $ 107.71 due on July 6, 2015 and I have not even activated their seri ice till now.
 Because of that some friends advised me to file a complain with you as you can protect the customer from such issues.
 P.S
 I tried to solve that with them but I couldn't and I tried to reach a higher level in customer service to speak about that but I couldn't reach anyone. In general it is difficult to reach them.
 Thank you and I do seek your help because I feel they screw me up.

222,"Dear Sir or Madam,
 I opened Comcast's Xfinity service by calling them about two month ago. An agent told me the price was $54.99 a month and she could help me open the account. I agreed. However, they charged me $64.99 a month. I called them twice about this issue in the past two weeks. The first agent told me they would call me back. However, they never did. The second agent basically hung off the phone after I told her what happened. I think at least their agents are not honest. I felt a kind of being robbed and fooled. $10 is not a big deal. However, I do not want to be fooled in such a way. So I decided to file a complaint. I am wondering if you can help me make them set the price to the right one. In this way, I also think we can make Comcast a better company.
 Thanks,

223,"I've been a customer with Comcast for over 6+ years and my only complain is that anytime I've done
 any upgrades or downgrades, I've been on the phone with them for hours, days and weeks
 sometimes because of the billing issue. The amount I get charged is always more and I never get the
 same information from the agents - at times, agents refuse to give their ID number and even hang up
 the phone, knowing that the conversation is going to go nowhere.
 I've attached my previous bills (October 2014-May 2015) and initially was paying an amount of
 $29.99; but in January 2015 I got an upgrade and was specifically told that it would be a $12.00
 increase in addition to the $29.99, which should add up to $41.99 (with the taxes) and that price
 would be good for a year (January 2016). The month of April my bill was $45.15 - no reason given, I
 paid it. And not for the month of May it's $56.99. That's a $15.00 increase from $41.99 - without any
 apparent reason. I called Comcast and after almost 45 mins to an hour of hold and being transferred
 I'm told that my promotional rate is over. How is it over if I just got the promotion in January 2015?
 I've attached the older bills and have previous bills as well (before October) if needed. I would highly
 appreciate it if someone could please look into this matter. I'm a full time student and I've to keep my
 spending at a budget. I do not have cable TV, phone service; just internet because I need to get my
 school work done from home, but with these fluctuating bills without any reason is really not
 acceptable. Last individual I spoke to, her name was Fey (no agent gives out last name) and ID # 2J4
 I await your response earnestly and thank you for your time and consideration into this matter."

 RE: COMCAST CABLE TV AND INTERNET SERVICE
 This is
 MI 48382
 3 phone calls and 4 online chats (by me) at least 6 phone calls, including hang ups, by my renters and nearly 10 hours of my time alone on the phone in the past few weeks and they have again screwed up and cut off the service at my rental property.
 We finally figured out that someone at Comcast signed me up for online billing and so I wasn’t receiving bills. When bills weren’t paid they cut off service. No one could find where I signed up and different people said I was and wasn’t signed up. Twice now I was told to pay the minimum immediately (which I did) and they would reinstate service and mail copies of the bills to me. And, not to worry no more was due until end of June..
 Then TV was restored but not internet. That required another 3 hours on the phone and a service call.
 Now service is cut off again. Renters called and were told it was shut off for nonpayment. I still have received no bills (inluding the past due ones that they twice said they would mail to me).
 Neither me nor my renters have any more patience left with these people. Every call is at least 2 +hours and no one understands English or the problem. Talking with a supervisor is out of the question. I was told last week, one would call me right back. After an hour, I called and they said to be patient. I waited by the phone for another 2 hours and never did receive a call. So, I had to start all over again.
 Today, I asked for a supervisor 3 times in the first 10 minutes and after 30 minutes, when I finally said I will not speak to you any longer, I want a supervisor or I will contact the FCC, they cut me off.
 This is outrageous treatment of customers. Everyone knows that Comcast is the most hated company in America but why are they allowed to do this to us?
 If I have the opportunity, I will also talk about how they give these “specials” that all expire at different times so that your bill is always different and you have to call in and go through a couple hours of negotiating to get it resolved. And, then, it can only be adjusted going forward, so the changes they make to your account have to be paid, even though you haven’t approved of them.
 My renter has a heart condition and is continually being stressed by them. I get so stressed I get sick over it. I’m a senior widow and I can’t do this all the time.
 What can you do to help me? I don’t mind paying bills but I need a bill to see what I am paying. I have always paid what they want when I call in and begged and been promised that bills would come in the mail so I could pay everything owed. How can they not send me bills and yet charge me late fees and cut off service and charge reinstatement fees? I haven’t had a bill since March and have made 2 credit card payments to them on the phone for reinstating. (b) (6)
 This is such an abuse of power and is so wrong.
 Thanks for whatever help you can give me.

 Since I filed the complaint on 6-18, I had a phone call from Comast on 6-19 from - Judy K., Executive Customer Relations, Comcast l Corporate, Office: (734) 254-1696
 she wanted to resolve the issue. I told her she was premature because I still had not received any bills to pay and credits had not been discussed with me. She said she would review my file and talk with me later. Then I received an e-mail from her with the same information. (Note, she said she would review my file but obviously hadn't prior to contacting me.)
 Fast forward to yesterday. and my renters (at the service location) received a call that ""their"" (my) account was overdue and service would be cut off. There is no reason for them to be calling my renters! Today, June 24, I received a notice in the mail, dated June 19, 2015 (a week ago!) indicating that I must pay $286.35 by June 28 (Sunday) or all service would be discontinued and I would incur reactivation fees etc. ! I have no idea what the $286.35 represents. I have asked for bills since March and have received none. In my numerous discussions with Comcast, I have requested copies of the bills so I could pay them - and - 3 times, told that they would be mailed to me - NOTHING! . I have asked for them to be faxed but told they cannot do that. On 5/30, I received a similar notice, dated a week before and with 2 days (June 1) to pay or be cut off .
 How did they let this notice even get to me? Why didn't this Judy actually read my file and figure out that I need bills to pay and do something about it! I don't know why I'm not getting bills but after so many weeks of this and hours of phone contact with them now pushing up into about 12, I am sick with stress!!!!!
 Fine these people!!!

 Please first re-read history below.
 I received the ""closing"" letter from Comcast yesterday. It is so wrong on so many levels! The letter accuses me of signing up for ""online billing"" and then not paying my bill. And, that they magnanimously provided credits to me for some late fees and reactivation fees!
 The issue here is that, since March, I have not received any bills! Each time I called to find out what is going on and to get a bill I was merely told what to pay and paid it. Numerous times I was told, (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 including by Judy K, the Comcast agent handling this complaint, that I WAS NOT SIGNED UP FOR ONLINE BILLING and should be getting bills in the mail! And just as many times I was told that I WAS SIGNED UP which made more sense because I was not receiving bills. With no bills to pay, my service was cut off twice. Add to that, then there was a technical problem and when they came out to repair, they tied the booster into a LIGHT SWITCH!!!, so that when they left and turned the light out, the service went out again. This prompted another service call which I understand I have been charged for. I do not have the July bill, despite Judy telling me that I would receive it by July 15. This is what happens every month. When I think I have this
 straightened out, I am promised a bill and never get one and then they cut off my service for not paying.
 I asked many times who signed me up for online billing because I would never do this and would not know how to use it and was never given an answer. I am a senior widow and these inconsiderate people are tormenting me. I have spent upwards of 15 hours trying to resolve this with them. I have been given the runaround and blamed for not paying all with their condescending attitude and basic rudeness. Now, in their closing letter, they admit that I was signed up for online billing in April and that they finally took me off of it in June. (Note that they didn't say who signed me up!) Once again, if they actually had taken me off online, I think I would have received a current bill in the mail and I have not!
 When reading off some of the charges on the bills I hadn't received, I was told that there was a charge for a movie. I told the agent Judy that I had asked everyone who could have possibly done that and everyone said that they did not rent that movie. Judy said that she would reverse the charge if I put a movie block on the service and when I said I didn't want to do that, she said ""well then I won't reverse the charge"".
 I asked the agent, Judy K, who was supposed to be settling this, what she was going to do to keep me as a customer and she replied ..... ""well, I am going to mail a copy of the old bills to you and be sure that you get bills in the future and I see that some charges have been reversed"". Really? Again in a condescending tone and with total arrogance! What about all the other service charges, late charges and credit when we did not have service!
 Despite what the letter says, THEY HAVE NOT APOLOGIZED TO ME.
 Since I don't have the July bill I was supposed to receive, I have no idea what the new charges presumably are for service tech, reinstatement and late fees again. And, even though I made a phone payment the other days for $100 just to make sure I didn't get cut off again, I have no idea where I stand with charges and all the payments they have taken from me over the phone since March.
 This is so unacceptable and such an abuse of power.
 If you, the FCC, cannot fine them, demand an acknowledgement of their errors and full resolution, I guess legal action would be my only recourse. And, that is not something I want to do.
 How do they manage to operate this way? The power of monopoly maybe??
 Thank you,

 Judy,
 This is exactly where I
 expected this to be.
 On 6/23, my renters
 got a recorded call saying that their
 service would be cut off for non-payment (there is no
 reason
 to be contacting my renters! I
 gave that phone number for
 serviceman to
 call prior to arrival). (b) (6)
 (b) (6)

 On 6/24, I received
 a FINAL NOTICE BEFORE SUSPENSION AND
 TERMINATION OF XFINITY SERVICES in the mail. It was date
 a
 week prior 6/19 and gave me 2 business
 days to pay
 $286.35. I have no idea what
 makes up this amount because
 I still have
 no bills. Since March I have requested bills
 and as late as 6/18 was promised all old and
 current bills
 would be mailed to me so I
 could see my charges, promised
 credits and
 credit card payments that have been taken while
 talking to your service people to resolve
 this.
 Saturday 6/27, still not bills and
 now a promise to cut off
 service AGAIN!!!
 I can't believe you even let this
 notice get sent out during
 this inquiry.
 I can't believe I still have no bills. The
 last supervisor said I could count on him
 sending bills
 because he was a
 ""supervisor"". I told him all the prior
 promises were made by ""supervisors as
 well"" and I doubted if
 I ever would
 receive them. Correct again!
 I'm
 expecting to be cut off tomorrow and at this point,
 hardly care. I have spent going on 12 hours
 in the past 2
 weeks with you. My primary
 renter has a severe heart
 condition and I
 am a senior widow. We are both stressed
 out to the max.
 You called me and then
 sent this e-mail and it looks like
 that is
 all that has happened. When I spoke with you
 on the phone on 6/19, I told you I was not
 settling with you
 until I got bills and
 credits promised. Neither one
 have
 happened. Likewise, I'm a bit surprised that , in
 your email, you indicated that you would
 review my complaint
 and get back to me.
 Don't you think it would have been
 appropriate to review my complaint BEFORE you called and
 emailed me?
 This is exactly
 representative of the COMCAST service that I
 and everyone else complains about. Your
 insincere
 words mean nothing. You will
 drag out any situation as
 long as you can
 until the customer gets so frustrated they
 give up.

228,"Comcast has a 300 gigabyte data cap in my area, which used to be 300 gigabytes. It has become increasingly difficult to stay underneath that cap. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only Internet service provider in my area right now, besides AT&T who only provides a 700 kilobyte/sec internet connection in my area. The data cap is the same whether you have a 3 megabyte/sec connection or a 10 megabyte/sec connection. It is completely unfair that people with a faster connection be punished more because they exceed their data cap much quicker.

229,"My girlfriend and I have, on numerous occasions, contacted Comcast regarding poor performance on our home Internet speeds, in addition to price hiking. My usual method of communication is by phone but the redirection to different agents is awful, so my girlfriend used her Twitter account to contact Comcast publicly and directly. Our issues were resolved for some time but they continue to occur. These issues mainly revolve around my data speed being too slow. I pay for 25 mbps minimum from the provider and have records that they have been shown where speeds are not as advertised. I am educated and technically knowledgeable and they tried to explain the issues were router location, among other things (the router is in our open living room and the signal was awful within 3 feet of plain sight from the router). After a few added complaints, our issues were resolved quickly overnight. They persist occasionally, as recently as this weekend. It is unstable and unreliable, and I am not compensated for the lack of service that is advertised. In addition to the service issues, our account received a price increase without notice starting October 2014. Until I spoke with a manager about my issues, we were completed unaware of this price increase and had subsequently incurred a number of late penalties for the lack of payment (which was unfortunately set to auto pay a specific amount). These late fees and price increase were demanded to be paid in order to restore service earlier this year.
 Please, FCC, see this is made right!

230,"My internet was running slow on WiFi. I called in, spoke with a rep, and she did some troubleshooting that involved switching channels on the router, but that didn't help. So she scheduled someone to come out to my house and look at it- at no point in the conversation was a fee, or the possibility of a fee- mentioned.
 A technician came and changed the wiring- he said it was split multiple times, which probably had an impact. He did some work (I have no idea what he did) but it didn't really help. He ended up saying that if we really wanted to see a difference, we should buy our own modem and router and maybe something to boost our signal. Again- did not mentioned that a fee would be charged or a fee might possibly be charged.
 This month I realized that a fee was charged, but customer service will not waive it, despite acknowledging that it was wrong and I should've been notified. They negotiated waiving half of it- but I also did not receive any kind of mailing or other alert that the fee had been charged- and I ended up being charged a late fee- because the first fee was not paid. Moreover, they charged a late fee before giving us any notice or opportunity to make that payment!

232,"A little over two weeks ago I moved to a new apartment. I went to purchase internet through Comcast since it is one of the only providers in my area for fast internet. I saw online a promotional price available in my area when I typed in my address until the beginning of the week of 6/21/15, for $39.99/mo for Blast! Internet at 50mbps for the first year. The second year was $54.99/mo, then after that would be the regular price of $76.95.. I purchased it online, set up my account, and my internet worked. I was surprised at how there was no hassle aside from conveniently not receiving an order confirmation email even though my order went through.
 On 6/18 or 6/19 I received my Comcast bill and I was being charged $76.95/mo for the internet service, and not the $39.99/mo that was shown on the website and the Order Information page before I actually submitted my order. I called Comcast support on the phone and each person I told about my issue said a variation of ""I can't do that, let me transfer you to this department who should be able to help you."" I was transferred through 5 people, before the 5th person went to transfer me to somebody else. While waiting for the 6th person to pick up, the line was disconnected. I called back and had to go through the whole automated thing again so I could talk to a person, and when being transferred to a person, the line disconnected me not once, but twice. I eventually reached another person who told me ""Oh, if its an online promotion we are unable to do anything about it over the phone. You need to use the online chat for this issue.""
 I then went to use the online chat and talked to one person who said ""That promotion does not exist and is not available in your area. The only offer available in your area is $59.99/mo for Internet Plus + Blast!"" So i asked him how this deal cannot exist if I am specifically looking at the deal right now that says its available for my area. He would not answer. Eventually our chat ended. Within moments of our chat ending, my person modem (not rented through Comcast) was restarted and I did not have internet for about 5-10 minutes. Convenient that it happened right after he had access to my account.
 I talked to a second chat person and she was extremely helpful and completely understood why I was unhappy. She noticed my account was improperly marked as a current customer rather than a new customer and that is why I was not given the promotional price. She notated my account that my package should be the Blast! $39.99/mo, but I had to call Customer Solutions Team and they would see the notation and fix my service in the system. I called them and ended up with a person from Billing I think who transferred me to somebody else who could help me. Even though my account was notated to be fixed, she would not fix it and said that the deal was not in her system for her to change it either. I again talked to somebody else who ALSO said that deal did not exist and that if it is an online promotion then they do not have access to it and the only way to get that promotion is to be a new customer and purchase online. This lady had an offer for $49.99/mo Blast! Internet, and offered me a $120 credit which would basically make it a $39.99/mo Blast! Internet. I still wasn't too happy
 but I wasn't sure if any other person would offer me this. I was still was concerned with my bill because I was being charged the full price for this month still, and she said I would just be given the credit on next months bill. But that doesn't solve the issue that I'll be paying 1 month at $76.95, and 11 months at $49.99 with a $120 credit. If I had the full 12 months at $39.99 I would end up paying $480, but with this $76.95 for 1 month + 11 months of $49.99 - $120 credit I'll be paying $506. She didn't seem to understand that. In addition to that, it would be $49.99/mo for the first year, then $69.99/mo for the second year, then the regular price of $76.95/mo afterwards meaning that the credit would only benefit me for the first year but I was still being screwed over on the second year by $180. I talked to another person and tried explaining it to her and she understand what I was concerned with but she also said she could not offer me the $39.99/mo promotion because it was not in the system even though that is what I confirmed my order on.
 So at this point, I was stuck with the $49.99/mo + $120 credit, but was screwed over for the second year. I looked at my account today (6/23/15) and I received credits of $8, $53.36, and $21.56, but at the same time I also received additional charges of $53.56 and $8. meaning I still had a credit of $21.56 on my account. However, it still says I owe Comcast the full price of the Internet. As a new customer I am completely disgusted with how they treated me.

233,"I believe we are being throttled by Comcast. We are paying for 25Mbps down and I believe 5Mbps up. This equates to 3.125MB/s down and 0.625MB/s up. I have tested our speed using Speedtest.net (while no devices were downloading anything and everyone else in my house was sleeping, so I'm the only one online), and it determined we were not getting the speeds we are paying for. This may be tied to my family's data usage for this month, which would constitute throttling. Comcast's website also mentions a 250GB data threshold, which we don't have. I'm not sure why it would even be mentioned (even if they say they aren't enforcing it) unless they are just proving why they are throttling us.

 Request #367313 ""Renting Equipment We Don't Want"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #367313:
 Comcast is forcing us to rent out their modem/router, which is raising our bill by $10 monthly. We don't want or need their equipment, but they sent it to us without warning around a year and a half ago and started charging us for it. Also, many of our devices are having trouble connecting to our internet recently, which probably has something to do with the throttling I mentioned in my previous complaint.

234,"I moved to Bloomington Indiana in the fall of 2014 and immediately signed up with Comcast for cable, internet and telephone service. From the first day, I have had constant trouble logging on to the internet, or getting on to the internet only to have it cut off on me within minutes. I have had numerous techs out to fix this as well as the televisions inability to stay connected with the xfinity. I have complained until I am blue in the face, listened to one excuse after another, put up with numerous techs sent out to fix the problem, supervisors who promise but never deliver on going to the next level as far as fixing the problems. They all seem to agree that the two issues are connected, but no one is concerned enough to truly delve into the situation and fix the problem. Out of desperation, last month when talking to a supervisor, I said that the only reliable service and response from Comcast to me is that my bill arrives on time every month. I then said that I was having a true problem figuring out what I was actually paying for when I have received such sub par service, and really felt that until my service is fixed to my satisfaction, maybe I should just refrain from paying my bill. She then informed me what a foolish idea that was because it would only result in my disconnection with Comcast and the resulting damage to my credit.

235,"I have a fixed income. I got behind on my bill and was unable to pay the past due balance that they gave me that was required to reactivate my internet service. I told them in the middle of May that I wasn't going to be able to pay the amount for some time. I got a letter in the mail at the end of may telling me that on the 31st of May my internet service would be completely disconnected and that if I wanted to keep it I needed to pay the 100 something dollars past due balance plus the month of June's balance, so a total of 200 or so dollars. However it is now June 25th, my service has been deactivated but not disconnected like they said they would and they continue to add months of billing for service that I'm not receiving. Now the bill is over 300 dollars and includes not only the month of June which I couldn't use their internet service at all for but now also includes the month of July. I can't pay and shouldn't have to pay for months that I didn't/don't receive the service that they want me to pay for.

237,"I called comcast to activate a replacement modem and in doing so, they reduced my internet speed
 by 90% from what I had been experiencing for my last 3 years of service.
 The agent offered me a cable and internet bundle that I declined, and now my internet is 10% of it's
 original speed. I have screenshots on several of my home devices from speedtest.net that indicate I
 had been receiving my original speed for several years. The supervisor told me I am now ""getting the
 speed I am paying for"", which does not even meet the FCC's definition of broadband. I just want the
 same speed I have been receiving for going on 3 years. I have upgraded and downgraded Comcast
 services during this time and have never had this happen. I believe that the rep who worked my
 account deliberately reduced my speed because I declined a cable bundle."
238,"I have a modem that I own, which Comcast keeps saying it is their modem. It is not. I purchased it on my own. I never even received any equipment from them at all when I first signed up for their broadband internet in early 2013, since I informed the Customer Service that I already had a modem. So I don't know how they can try and justify these charges, even after fighting (and resolving) the issue three times now.
 Ever since getting internet from Comcast, 1-2 times a year Comcast would add the rental charge to my bill without informing me about it. I had to fight the charge at a physical Xfinity (Comcast) store to get the charges reversed. I have to be vigilant on every bill!
 When I asked the customer service manager at an Xfinity store location, he informed me that Comcast does an audit multiple times a year, and my modem keeps incorrectly getting flagged as theirs. It is not theirs, I own the modem. I never even received any modem from them. I've talked with customer service over the phone many times, but they refer me back to the physical Xfinity store. It can only be taken care of in person.
 I have to drive to the location (my time and money for gas to drive there), plus time to wait in line for the privilege of getting my monthly bill fixed.
 I asked the customer service manager if he could put a note on my account that I own the modem, so it would stop charging my modem rental fee's, he told me Comcast does not have a system to track that. So 1-2 times a year I have to fight the bill because of this fraudulent modem rental charge. Over, and over again.
 I recently received a letter form Comcast dated 09 June 2015, that they will start charging me again for my modem that I own. No where in the letter does it say how to dispute this charge. I will again have to take time out of my day, spend money on gas, and put unneeded miles on my already-old car to drive to the Xfinity store just to get a cable internet bill that is correct.
 In summary, my complaint is that Comcast keeps fraudulently charging me Cable modem rental fees, mostly without informing me to allow me to dispute them, or even a reasonable way to dispute it so that I won't see these charges ever again. In the meantime, I have to pay a larger cable bill then I agreed upon when signing up for their internet service.

242,"I just started service with Comcast in a home I just rented. Technician came to my home and brought receivers, because the house already had service before we lived there. Comcast proceeded with charging me over $300 in installation fees, which were never disclosed to us. I called back 8 times trying to dispute these charges and was promised a call back from a supervisor on numerous occasions. After the 8th attempt, I was advised that a ticket was submitted and that a specialist would review and get back to me. I spoke to a representative and told them that I authorize a payment of $120 to be charged to my card until the specialist reviews all other fees. Instead they proceeded with charging me the full amount. When I called them back to have it credited, they refused to credit me the money back. I had to contact my bank and have the charges reversed. I have had service for 2 months and it has been the worst service ever! The signal drops all of the time. I have spent hours on the phone with them getting this resolved. I work a full time job and have 2 small children and shouldn't have to call comcast every single day and fight with them for hours on end.

243,"I have Comcast service on 2 different address. I went to their office and returned their leased modem
 and asked to disconnect one of the address. Once I got home I realized that they disconnected the
 wrong address and I called them right away. After a lot of back and forward I got the Internet back to
 work but at 3 mbit only instead of 25 mbit which is what I've been paying for a while. The customer
 care representative said that she couldn't do anything about it , it was a billing problem and she
 transferred me . The billing department said that the can't do anything about it, and put us on hold
 and after 30mins they dropped the call. I'm very tired of this situation, every time I have an issue with
 the service I feel like Im getting a heart attack, it's very frustrating to deal with Comcast service."
244,"I have had service with Comcast at my home since 1999. I have always had my own modem for the
 internet connection with Comcast. In 2008 I asked Comcast to no longer provide me with television
 services and only provide me with internet access. I have always had my own modem for the internet
 access and NEVER leased a Comcast modem. I always had my bills paid automatically with direct
 charge to my credit card. In February 2015 I noticed that my bill increased. I reviewed the bill in
 detail and noticed that Comcast has been charging me for the television services and for leasing of a
 modem. I was able to access prior bills for only 9 months and all of them had the same charges. I
 contacted Comcast in February of 2015 and was on the phone with several representatives. I was
 assured that their accounting department will research this matter and refund me the money that was
 charged to me. I contacted Comcast twice since then and was told that the matter is being
 researched. As of today 5-15-2015, I have not received any communication or refund of the wrongful
 charges.
 I called Comcast today once again, because a $70 charge was noted on my bill due in two days for a
 service call. In fact we lost our Comcast Internet connection for 1 week last month. A service
 technician was called . Comcast informed me that we had to wait for 6 days for a technician to come.
 When he came, the technician identified a problem outside our home with a Comcast cable. He
 performed the repairs, all outside our home and restored the service. When I called today to dispute
 the $70 charge I was told by a representative that the paperwork showed that repairs were performed
 INSIDE my home. I stated to the representative that it is not true, and in fact to this day the new
 cable has not been berried in the ground and remains a danger to me and my family. The
 representative informed me that they will have to research the issue and determine if the repairs were
 performed inside or outside my home.
 Clearly Comcast is engaged in unlawful and deliberate overcharging to their customers for the
 equipment and services that area not performed. I am attaching the available bills as evidence of
 these problems with Comcast.

 does a speed test she gets 3Mbps download/1Mbps upload. She is going to purchase a new modem

 This morning, June 10th, I am unable to do the simplest task on my computer, for example, read and
 delete email. The speed I am receiving at the current time tested at 1.12 megabits per second. The
 performance package that I am paying for is supposed to be 25 megabits per second. My speed test
 results are variable but the highest result I have had is 10 megabits per second. Comcast does not
 seem able to provide me reliable ""high speed"" service. I am sure I am not the only customer being
 defrauded by Comcast and I have no intention of taking them to court. It would be good if people in
 my area had a real choice of providers. I, likewise, have no intention of letting their technicians near
 my equipment because it works perfectly all the time. It is the service that Comcast provides that
 doesn't work much of the time. I don't know why their ""highly trained technicians"" can't fix what is
 wrong with Comcast's service. What I want is what I am paying for High Speed Internet Service. In
 addition to paying for internet service I pay $70 a month for cable TV which I pay through my
 maintenance. For this amount I get basic service. The choice of programming for that large amount of

 This morning, when I wrote the complaint, the speed that I received 1.18 megabits per second was
 with the new modem that I purchased for $75 because Comcast's representatives told me that I
 would not be able to receive high speed with the modem that I had. I purchased a new high speed
 modem that supposedly gets 343 megabits per second and I still did not get high speed. The highedt
 speed that it tested at was 10 megabits per second and most of the time it got a little more than 3
 megabits per second. After I made this complaint the new modem that I have started to reboot itself
 every few seconds. I became alarmed that something would break and I called support to tell them to
 (b) (6)
 stop fiddling with my modem. I was told that no one was doing anything to my modem. I removed the
 new modem and reattached the old modem which worked immediately. It tested at 3.5 megabits per
 second. I have no idea what to do to get high speed internet but at this point I don't think that I will get
 it from Comcast.

 After being on the phone 2 days and being transferred from one person to another ,no one was able to help (7-8 transfers of telephone calls). They outsource to the Philippines.This service is horrible.

 Thank you for your assistance with my complaint against Comcast . I was initially pleased to receive an email from a Comcast executive in reference to my complaint which asked me to call them. I complied immediately and reached an answering device. I left my telephone numbers on the answering device for a Ms. Tonica Freeman . After a number of repeat calls reaching only an answering device I received an email from Tonica Freeman stating that was “ unable to reach me”.
 I checked my voice mail and missed calls list and find no such call was made to me nor were any messages left by Ms. Freeman so I must take it for granted that this was getting me nowhere.
 I have continued making calls daily to the number provided by Comcast and Tonica Freeman.I have a record of 7 calls yesterday made to the number provided 561-227-3426-3426. I enclose the record of such calls for yesterday June 25th. I have hit the proverbial stone wall.

248,"Comcast disconnected my account without reason or notice. I am disabled homebound. I moved in to my house and for 2 weeks had no new Internet service after setting up my new account. I called several times. They told me the modem was the problem. Then I called today to say there was no signal to my home. They said my account was cancelled.

 I would like to add that I was offered a 14.99 internet plan with no activation fee. This was after 4 telephone calls to correct the account which had been bumped to a TV account plus Internet when all I wanted was the 14.99 promotion. They seem reluctant to sell me the 14.99 internet and finally relented, only to cancel my service without my knowledge.

 Was told today by Comcast that they were sending a technician to my house for 39.95. I asked why and they told me it was for a service call. I called back 5 minutes later and the supervisor told me there was no need for a service call, or a charge, because the problem was with the Comcast system. Billing could not remove the charge. I still have no service and the FCC representative at Comcast
 never called back as promised. I now have charges and have never had service. Additionally, Comcast has added TV service to my account even though I only ordered Internet for 14.99. This is the second time they have done this without my permission. It seams like an ongoing game with their office."
249,"Comcast...
 My internet is out.
 I called 3 times, wasted literally 1:30+ minutes- no support at all.
 1-dropped call after attempting to set up an service to come home, 2-unable to set up the service due to an issue (?), 3-connected to California center where I live in Florida.
 Unbelievable service- no wonder Comcast is the 2nd most hated company.

250,"I have been renting my modem from Comcast for years and the original monthly cost was $7. Shame on me for not paying attention but I just noticed that they increased my monthly rental fee over a year ago and it's now $10 a month. They have never serviced it or replaced, so how can they justify the need for the price increase in my case. I know it's only $3 but multiply that by the millions of units they lease and it's an unjustified windfall for them. I can understand charging more for new modems but this makes no sense, how can the FCC permit this?

251,"I will try to sum it up and bullet this out. Background is that we moved, and I contacted our service provider Comcast in February 2015 to make sure our TV, phone, and internet would be a seamless transfer. I spoke with Bob who told me how it would all work and assured me that we are all set. In the end, he was correct, but all the in between information was catastrophic. Bob said this was a ""transfer"" of services, so once we move, the TV and Phones will no longer exists (we will get a new phone number), but email will continue through our mobile devices until our service is hooked up at which point everything will be back. This was supposed to happen on March 22nd, it is now April 14th and we are still not up and running, no internet, emails, TV, phones, nothing. We moved on March 31st. Email disaster too.
 At this moment, I feel as though we (for all services) and all of our emails are being held hostage by Comcast. If we could change providers without massive disruption to our life, I would, but because I was informed that there would be no issues, therefore, we decided to wait to get our Comcast service at our new house. This was supposed to happen on March 22nd.
 I am usually the one who is accepting of situations when they are clearly articulated, knowledgeable, factual, and provided by someone who is committed to customers. This is not Comcast.
 Issues:
 1. Misinformed that our new house had service, therefore a technician will come March 22nd to hook us up there - wrong!
 2. Technician comes 3/22 and cannot help us, the line was severed, there is no service to connect - no lines from the street to the house (which is over 400ft). He will talk to his supervisor to get a ticket in.
 --- we move --- not a word from anyone at Comcast.
 3. No word on this for a few weeks - NOTHING, no confirmations, calls, nothing - but our email was still working. I just wanted to confirm that we were on the schedule for getting a line in, and then service hooked up.
 4. April 5th week, I decide to find out what is going on.... this is where it goes crazy.
 5. Spoke with a service rep Izzy to see if I could confirm we were all set. She said the tech will be there April 21st. I know this, I wanted to make sure the construction people that they arrange are coming soon to do this part. She said she did not see a construction order, but the tech will be there 4/21.
 6. Spoke with Izzy's supervisor, to find out what is going on, does the Tech dig a trench or go into the trees, she said ""no"". I asked who can I call to find out about the construction part - no construction, no tech needed. I wanted to know the construction order was in and a date he/she would be there.
 7. She gave me a number that was not correct - name was right.
 8. Called Bob who gave me a number, but through the prompter his name was not listed.
 9. I randomly hit a number, left a message for someone to have the construction guy - Dave please call me. He did, he was great. (he is not affiliated with Comcast).
 10. In the meantime, our email was disconnected on April 12th - no clue why.
 11. Called to find out what is the problem here are some of the responses I got:
 * no clue
 * it is just disconnected, that is what happens
 * your email was not flagged as a transfer
 * I am so sorry, you have lost everything
 * your email stays active for 2 weeks and then disconnects
 * No you didn't lose everything, just from April 12 - 21st when you should have service back - those will be gone
 * Your account is flagged as a transfer so once your service is connected, it will all be there
 I spoke to four people - finally the last one Pat, seemed to get it right, but I don't trust anything from them right now. She asked me when the construction people will be there -- I said ""how would I know this, you guys hire them, they work for you..""
 13. I asked ""why"" should I stay a customer of yours (to Jessica) - she said ""we have the fastest internet""... considering I have nothing right now, no one ever said our internet would disconnect, NOTHING that this was going to happen. 14. I said ""why"" would I pay for your service going forward"" - I told her I did not want to pay for this service for a year. She had no answer, except ""let me review your plan"" thinking she could help us save money there.... I have no plan! I have nothing right now~
 I am absolutely blown away by the number of people and supervisors I have spoken to, all because I heard nothing and thought I would give a call to see where it all stands. I am a person who plans, takes action and ensures that things are all set when they happen, no glitches, no surprises.
 Due to their lack of knowledge, lack of communication, lack of true customer service, and one customer just checking in... 6 weeks later I learned how incompetent, uncaring and disinterested they are in their customers. I got different answers every time I spoke with someone. As I went up the chain and would get a ""supervisor"" on the phone, the story always changed (usually for the better, but never fully correct). Unfortunately, supervisors have absolutely no authority, and as one said ""my hands are tied"". I asked if I could speak with someone who didn't have their hands tied.. I finally got Pat. She said she would call me right back and 2 hours later, I am still waiting.
 I have spent hours and hours on the phone with them, on hold, shuffled from department to department, trying to find out where things stand, why things happened, trying to find out the truth, and all for what...? because I want my email back. Hostage - we are being held hostage by Comcast. I do not want to pay for a service that is as corrupt as they are, however, they have my life on hold as I have saved critical emails from the past that are important to our family life. Lesson learned.

 Our story continues.... although our email is now up and running (we lost 3 days), we were very much looking forward to our service being hooked up on April 21st - construction order in place, all set! I am counting the hours~!! Today, April 17th, we received an email from comcast ""confirming the change to our appointment to May 15th!"" Are you kidding me. Neither of us called to change this. Called comcast, appears a technician changed this, no notes, no email of who did it (I think his name is Bob cause someone slipped), no clue from the customer solutions. Unbelievable. We are standing our ground to be hooked up on April 21st. The customer support person put us back on the schedule for April 21st, however, we need a construction guy to come out too, she is working on this. We are at a total loss. Cannot believe someone change this, and the email said it was ""confirming our change order"".. See below:

252,"There is only one high speed ineternet provider available where I live. As far as I know Comcast has signed an agreement with our LFA that disallows other companies from getting into the market. This creates a monopoly as they are the only high-speed provider available unless we move out of town which is unreasonable to ask to have a different ISP with similar speed offerings. Due to the requirements of many web sites and services DSL service, which I am currently using from Verizon, is becoming increasingly insufficient for average use cases.

253,"I have internet service through Comcast in the Trenton, NJ area. I repeatedly find that customer
 service (via the phone, and I believe through my online account), will offer higher prices than what I
 see online, when they don't realize I have an account (not logged on). The Billing department, when
 challenged why I'm not hearing the lowest prices will tell me ""Oh, by the way, our department doesn't
 offer all prices. Do you want that department?"". How many customers never realize this and pay
 excess to this effective monopoly?"
254,"I pay for my comcast cable which includes hbo, Comcast internet, and I paid for my ps3 which has an app that Sony developed to play hbo go on my tv. I presumably paid for this app as it is downloaded from Sony available to people who purchased play stations. Right now comcast doesn't let their customers use the ps3 app because of ""purely commercial decisions"" meaning there are no technical issues, they are just blocking the use of the app to their customers. I was wondering why it is ok for them to block content I pay for on a device that I paid for because (presumably) they want more money from sony?

258,"Comcast overbilled me for their double play promotion in Boston, MA, 02114, by charging me 94.99/month for a plan advertised to be 54.99/month. They sent me an email receipt after ordering state the charges are 54.99/month. When my first bill came, it was 94.99/month plus installation. Numerous complaints and still not resolution. They added on a DVR and HD box when this was specifically not requested, fees of which amount to an additional 20/month, when none of this was explained or even asked for by the customer. Despite having a receipt (that they acknowledge), stating my original bill was supposed to be 54.99/month, they overcharged and are refusing to lower it below 74.99/month for the remainder of the year.
 They refuse to take off the HD fee of 10/month, despite the fact that it was nowhere to be found in the promotion OR receipt they sent me. I asked to take this off as I did not sign up for the service but they state that is not possible, and also told me they have no ability to fix my current bill but I should overpay and they will ""fix it later"" - my first bill was $150 (with installation ...for a service that is supposed to be $54.99!
 I don't think I should have to call them multiple times per month to sort out a billing issue they keep making errors on. Just charge me the price advertised, please.

259,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 year my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 70 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 Dear FCC,
 I think you should check with the the initiator of the complaint (me) before you close a complaint. It is not resolved if one side says the issue is resolved. Comcast still has not provided me with a copy of an agreement to review before I decide to sign or not.
 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if you require additional information.

263,"My neighbor has Xfinity/Comcast service for phone, Internet and cable TV. I was on the phone
 helping her drop Internet service (only¬) and trying to find out how much she would pay monthly for
 the reduced service.
 I was told she had to pay $180 to be released from her contract, a contract that she didn’t remember,
 but that Comcast claimed prevented her from downgrading her service for three years.
 After a half-hour of back and forth, the representative admitted that my neighbor had only been
 “presented” with the contract, but she had never “accepted” it. At this point I was put on hold and
 transferred to another representative, who, after more back and forth we may have given us the
 information we were requesting, I say “may” because we are not sure. All we were trying to learn was
 what would be her monthly bill if she dropped her internet service and kept her cable TV and phone
 service the same as it is now. This should be a simple, easily answered question. What we heard
 from the second representative was convoluted and not entirely clear.
 I interpret the statement, “You have a contract that says you must pay $180 to drop service” as
 fraudulent behavior on Comcast’s part. I cannot prove that it is standard operating procedure, but it
 did not feel like it was a singular incident. It felt like the representative was trained to mislead callers
 about non-existent “contracts” when they sought information about dropping service.
 In addition, I think that it was completely unreasonable for Comcast to take an hour to answer a
 simple question about the cost of reduced service. The delay, the questions, and the passing us to
 another representative felt like an intentional practice on Comcast’s part to discourage individuals
 from reducing service. I recently had another, entirely positive, swift experience when I called about
 initiating service with Comcast."
264,"Hi,
 I am currently paying for a 50 Mbps connection through Xfinity (Comcast) in Boulder, CO. This morning when I woke up however, the download speed I received was less than 1 Mbps. I then called Xfinity support and tried to solve the problem with the Xfinity representative, but 1.5 hours later nothing had been solved and (I believe) out of frustration, the Xfinity representative hung up on me. I called back immediately and asked to speak to a supervisor, after being on hold for over 25 minutes, I was told the supervisor was 'unavailable' and I could expect a call-back within 1 hour. This was about 8-9 hours ago, and I still have not heard a single thing. Just before filing this complaint, I called Xfinity support again to try to figure it out, and actually got to speak to a supervisor. I was told the slow speeds are, and I quote: ""completely normal, and nothing to be worried about"". I told the supervisor that this is unacceptable, as I have paid for a service which I am not receiving. Right after saying this, I got hung up on again. I am absolutely irate at the horrendous quality of Xfinity/Comcast's customer support service, and I would like an explanation about why customers are being treated this way. Also, while testing my internet speeds, I noticed something interesting. I ran 4 different speed tests, Speedtest.net, att.com/speedtest, bandwidthplace.com, and of course Comcast's own speedtest.comcast.net. Speedtest and Bandwidthplace gave me results of under 1 Mbps, and the AT&T test couldn't even complete due to the slow speeds. The Xfinity speedtest however shows I have a high speed connection of around 30 Mbps, even though I can barely even watch a YouTube video at a 480p resolution. To me this concludes that the Xfinity/Comcast speed test is wildly inaccurate, to a point where I actually feel lied to. To verify, I have included screen shots of the different speed tests I ran (all taken within 5 minutes of each other). Is there perhaps another explanation for this situation? Upload speeds however are normal at around 12 Mbps, which shows that the problem is not on my end. Thank you very much.

269,"Hi,
 I relocated from San Francisco to Montana in a hurry due to job offered. I took the comcast equipment with me to Montana because I didn't have time to return.
 I got a chance to called comcast sometime in last November/Early December about the equipment that I have with me them. The gentleman I spoke to told me that I just need to pay off and return the equipment and that would be it. I don't have to do anything else. I paid my ""balance"" when I called comcast a couple days before Christmas 2014 and was told that I have no balance with comcast but I should call Comcast in later in January 2015 to see if I have any balance left. It didn't make any sense because he just told me that I am all clear. He said that I need to call in to close my account. I don't have any balance left but my account still needed to be closed.
 I called in a couple times in January an was waited for almost 45 mins each time. I gave up because I was thinking that since I own comcast nothing and my old apt in SF was already rented then I should be able to move on with my life.
 In March 2015, I have a letter from Diversified Consultants with the message that I need to pay for $211.12 from account with comcast.
 I contact comcast again after I got the letter and they didn't want to communicate with me. It is not right for me to have to pay any extra than what I owed because I paid for the service and I return the equipment.
 If they want all their customer to call again after all just to close their account then they should make it more convenience for the consumer/their customers. There are multiple ways to do this but comcast chose to have the least inconvenience ways to deal with the customers who wanted out. To be honest, I only cancel comcast because they don't have service here in Bozeman.
 I finally have to money to pay today 6/13 which I end up paying $221.12 ( $10 process fee with Diverified).
 I am very upset because comcast took advantage of the situation. They make it very difficult to close the account which I have try my best to follow their rules. I couldn't becasuse I can't wait more that 45mins to close my account?!?
 I need my money back, $221.12. Please.

 If they are going to charge for usage, they need to provide customers with tools to manage that usage allowing us to limit bandwidth allocated to a given service, site, or protocol.
 They should also provide us with details on what service, site, or protocol resulted in the bandwidth usage.

I've asked comcast for a credit considering how slow my speeds were and I shouldn't have to pay full price when only receiving 60% of service. I know that if I was to pay only 60% my service would be disconnected pretty quickly. When I bring it up with customer service they laugh and say ""thats not how it works"" They also have somewhat of a monopoly of my area. The only other provider is Frontier and they cannot deliver speeds over 6 mbps, I do a lot of work from home and need the faster speeds. Please look into this, I am confident I am not the only one who's experienced this.

277,"A box appeared on top of my email saying I should use Xfinity internet. I closed the box. It came up two more times and the last time it froze my email. I could not use my email and there was no way to close the box. I called Comcast and asked them to remove the box and let me back into my email. They did something and after an hour I finally got my email back. This is the second time this has happened. I don't want to use Xfinity for my email. It was suggested that I call the security department to make sure that this didn't happen again. They never answered the phone. I held on for 18 minutes, then called back and held on for about 20 more minutes. I don't want this to happen again. They, also, slow down my internet every night between 6 and 10:00. Sometimes it takes up to 4 minutes (I timed it!) to open an email. I'm paying for high speed service and don't think that they should do this.

 getting the correct internet speed that i'm paying for. So I call to activate my new modem. It gets
 activated and the guy keeps trying to sell me the triple play package (I only have internet with them) I
 said No i have directv i don't need that. I said no thanks maybe 2 to 3 times. I get off the phone.
 About an hour later i get an e-mail confirming that I upgraded to the triple play package! He upgraded
 my account after i repeatedly said NO!"
279,"it has been over 1 year that comcast has not been able to fix our issue with slow internet speed and interrupted tv streaming. Each person that shows up at our house tells us it is something else and has to reschedule another person to show up making us take another day off from work. The wire was replaced from our home to the pole and that person said there was not enough bandwidth to give us steady streaming and we should buy biz class. we did and nothing changed, another person came and said it was our equipment so we bought another different apple modem or router thing and that still did not help. We called and the person on the phone sold us 105 speed service and said that would fix the system coupled with moving our equipment which we scheduled comcast to come to the house and do. The person never showed up. another lost day of work. Then they sent another guy who replaced our equipment and said the system did not have to be moved but he could not get good access and said there is a throtteling problem? and the issues is at the pole. he told us that we would never get the advertised 105 as the fine print says ""up to"" and not to expect much more than what we are getting because of the lack of band width to the neighborhood. He scheduled someone to fix the issue at the pole on a saturday, we waited home all day and no one showed. Today we have no service at all. I left messages and emails for comcast and they finally returned my call today and wanted me to take another day from work. I am very frustrated that internet is way slow and the cable programs can only be watched with blackout interruptions every few minutes. We are tired of giving up vacation days to people that cant fix the problem and are tired of being up sold to things that dont deliver what we are told they deliver. We have no options as comcast is the only cable company we have. What to do??

 While I have taken time off from work to meet the comcast people at my home they still have not fixed the issue. My tv programs just stop playing and the screen says looking for signal. I have upgraded to the 105 per the person on the phone but the comcast person that came to my home said getting 20 or 30 is acceptable because it is UP TO 105 not 105. Speed tests are erratic on our computer and were on the technicians setup. I want to know what is expected from a 105 service and should it be delivered consistently or not. If Comcast ie throttling the amount of bandwidth as one of their techs said they do should that be my issue? Is there enough bandwidth coming in to my neighborhood? Why does this company cause me so much stress and my PTO days wasted on non performance? I took a day off to have a guy not show. I did receive a call yesterday from another rep who wants me to take yet another day off or give up half of my sunday to hang around so another rep can check what the past three did. HELP!!!!!!

 It is 9:53 on MOnday July 27th and I am sitting here still after well over two years of issues with Comcast waiting for a page to load. Tehy still owe me three 20 dollar self imposed fines for not being here on time not showing up at all etc. THey were in my house out of my house replaced the wire to my house leaving the wire in my bushes and was told the problem is throttling? in the neighborhood. Lastly I was told perhaps they have to allocate more bandwidth to the neighborhood. No word and I am still with service that is slower than dial up. We can not get or try fios as for some reason it is not allowed here in Brick NJ Can someone please give me an answer as to why my house has to have beyond slow service speeds? Lastly I asked the comcast person after I was sold the 105 speed package what level is acceptable as I found out only after I bought this that it is UP TO 105 meaning it could be 5 or 10mbps upload and they will still be true to the program. WHat is acceptable continuous service when you advertise 105? Is it 50?80? or 30? We need some help so my kids can do homework at home and not have to go to the library to use internet. I appreciate the FCC but if you just pass my comments and expect them to do more than call me you may be mistaken. Who else shall I complain to my senators? Congressman? Governors office? WHats next?"
280,"Comcast is the only Broadband ISP available in my area. Because of this, I have to pay more for services I do not use. I had the Blast Internet (125 Mb/s Down 10 Mb/s Down) which is the fastest package available. I had this for a year, and paid about $47 a month. After a year, I would have had to pay $80 for the standalone internet package. I called their Customer Solutions department and they told me that I had to get cable to get a better deal. I do not use cable TV since I have Netflix and other streaming sites and apps. Therefore, I was forced into getting more services than I use to make my bill go down each month. They did throw in HD free for a year, but that is about 25 channels as I got the lowest TV package.
 I would love to take my business elsewhere, however, there are no other providers in my area that meet the FCC standard of broadband.

281,"I believe it is false advertisement when they claim that you can get an internet package for $54.99, but then charge you a $10 modem rental fee and other fees that are not regulatory or government imposed. The cost of the device rental should be waived since the device has to be returned when the service contract ends, or should be a part of the base price for the package. I purchased service through them in the past, and renewed service since and they always quote a good price and there is always at least a $15-20 difference from what I am told I will pay.
 Also, last year my service was cut without a good enough reason. It took them a month to tell me what I needed to turn it back on. In the end, I had done what they required a week into the dispute and they said it didn't work. So I did the same exact thing again, and they accepted it. I was never formally apologized to by the company for the frustration of not having service for a month when it was clearly an issue on their end. I would simply like a written apology from the company about that issue that is on file.

 According to what I have read in the paper and on line, Comcast/Xfinity will be issuing their customers a $5.00 credit for the days loss of telephone and internet, which doesn't seem enough for all the missed calls and emails. They have never before authorized a credit for any other time we were without service. We will have to wait and see if this truly happens. Thank you for your response.

283,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years, we were forced to move about 9 months ago and
 with nowhere to go we temporarily moved in with family. There was no need anymore to pay for
 Internet, but I liked Comcast and wanted to keep my email address with them and re-connect as soon
 as we were able to get back into our own home. I called Comcast to see what my options were, and
 they informed be that I could suspend my account for a small fee (somewhere around $8-10/month)
 and that would keep my account on hold but still be able to use the email. I thought that sounded
 good and agreed to that. The home buying process took way longer than expected, and after about 8
 months, I noticed my bill from Comcast was over $100. Shocked, I called them to see what
 happened, and that is when they informed me that I could only suspend my account for 6 months and
 when that time period was up, they started charging me for full service at a house I did not live at. I
 explained to them that no one told me that information and asked if that time could be extended.
 They said there was no way to do that and I would have to pay full price to keep my email going. I
 refused and went ahead and cancelled my account. I tried to talk to them about reducing my bill to
 the amount I expected to pay for that time, but was told to contact billing to discuss that. Their
 attempt to transfer to billing ended up in being disconnected. Other attempts were made to get in
 touch with them but were unsuccessful. Tired of trying, I decided to wait until I got my final bill to see
 if they fixed it or not. I never got a bill from them, I did however start getting phone calls asking me to
 verify my social security number so they could discuss a business matter, that seemed odd so I would
 not provide the information. Shortly after that, I received a collection notice in the mail from a
 collection company about the Comcast account for a balance of $108. I called the company, which
 was very polite and understanding and noted on my account that I was going to try to resolve this with
 Comcast. Again, multiple attempts were made to get to billing just to get the after hours message
 (sometimes during business hours). Finally I got through to someone, explained the situation, and
 only offered a $8 credit and still asked for $100. Asked to speak with the supervisor, at which point I
 learned that at some point one of the agents I spoke with lied about my conservation and
 documented that I understood about the 6 month time limitation. I was not informed about that until 8
 months into the account hold, two months after raising my rates without me knowing. The supervisor
 was rude and insisted that I was aware of the 6 month rule and refused to credit my account, and
 demanded I pay the full $108. Now, I am in the middle of trying to close on purchasing my house
 which might be in jeopardy due to Comcast's dishonest practices."
284,"I had to fight with Comcast to reduce my bill to the winter rate. It took 4 long phone calls and 2 web discussions before I was finally put onto the winter rate some time in January. I started in early October. I got some credit back but have no idea how much credit. Then I got a bill on April 24 telling me I owed $178 because they resumed my TV and internet service at a higher rate starting March 31. I called again and was told they reduce the service to basic service retroactive to March 31 where I would pay $67 a month. I was told I wouldn't come off of winter service until I called and I planned to resume service in May. I had no choice but to accept the deal to pay $67 a month starting March 31. I was told they would send me an email with the details of what I owe. I have yet to receive any details. REally getting tired of getting scammed by Comcast.

288,"Comcast is over charging me by about $10 each month. They agree it is an over charge. I want them to bring my account balance to $0, erasing all late fees and $5 administrative assistance charges and begin charging me correctly $34.34 as I was charged in my first bill August of 2014.
 When I last talked with Comcast they wanted me to pay the over charge bill in full before the credit is applied. They say that the next bill will be lower and that it will then be corrected. I want the credit applied and I will continue to pay them only what I correctly owe. In January I spoke with a women in billing and we agreed I would pay $35.63 each month. (Which is higher then my first bill.) The problem has not resolved. The billing is not consistent and the roll over of overcharges which then incur a late fee is ridiculous! I attached my first bill and then the December and January bills which show a few changes. The April bill is also attached, it is the most currant as of this filing.

289,"I am very frustrated with the service that I get from Comcast. When I originally signed up for their service, it was offered at a lower rate for the cable/internet bundle, which I was alright with, though I didn't want to have cable since I never actually watch it. The internet speed that they offered though was a good speed, so I decided to just suck it up and go with them. I started off paying about $64 per month in July 2014 for their Internet Plus bundle of 10 channels and 25 Mbps, to them raising the rate in January 2015 to about $68, and in May to $78! I ended up calling them to remove cable entirely from my bill, and they wanted to charge me $70 for just the 25 Mbps internet! I ended up having to sign up for 6 Mbps (A HUGE cut in the speed I had been using) in order to not spend an arm and a leg for the services I WANT to use. I think it's incredibly under-handed that they have the audacity to charge more for just internet service especially when it's the same speeds as in the bundle.
 I would cancel their service altogether, but the only other service we have in our area is AT&T U-Verse, and their service is historically spotty around where I live, and living in this day and age without having internet is no longer an option.

 everything since I have a child in school and need Internet), he instead added all comcast services to
 my plan. Internet and Home Security was not working properly and when I threatened to disconnect
 Home Security, I was told that I could not because I was in a 3 year contract. I informed them that I
 only signed a work order and I would never enter into such an agreement because:
 1) I am leasing my apartment and my lease is 1 year
 2) My job is uncertain since I work for Time Warner Cable (the very company they were going to
 purchase)!!
 They sent me the so-called contract and I received:
 1) The work order that I told them I signed (which states ""Work Order"" at the top and has my
 signature).
 2) A 5 page document that I have never seen before, is not filled out by me and most importantly, it is
 NOT SIGNED BY ME!!! WHO'S SIGNATURE IS THAT!?! It looks nothing like my name/signature -
 which is on the work order!
 WHAT IS GOING ON!?
 This HAS to be illegal.
 There is a scam going on with Comcast and their home security and consumers need to be made
 aware and protected from such blatant FRAUD!!"

294,"Several times I've called Comcast to try to lower my overly charged services, which includes Highspeed Internet and Cable TV, but have had no success.
 We don't use Cable TV at home, and one of the reasons we don't watch cable is because of the box they've provided us with is not HD, and all of the channels have black vertical lines on the side. And this is when my free to air antenna that cost me $14 at Walmart picks up beautiful quality channels.
 We mostly use the highspeed internet, which includes surfing the web, as well as streaming videos.
 I've tried to lower my bill by asking them to remove all of the cable packages and they always tell me how much more I would end up paying.
 Why can't i just have a decent 100Mbps highspeed internet package and pay $35 a month being that I own my own cable modem.
 I've tried looking for different providers, but the only other one available in my area is Verizon, which only provides DSL, a subpar speeds.

301,"I have had a 105 Mps plan from Comcast for $34.99 per month in Broomfield, CO. In May, Comcast raised my rate to over $80 per month with absolutely no warning or notice (I was specifically told when I was opening my account that I would have plenty of notice before any price increase) . Since I do not have any need for Cable TV or Phone services, I was told that my only option was paying over $55 per month for a slower internet only plan. After saying I will be canceling my service and switching providers, a manager was able to offer a slower internet only package at 50 Mps, at a rate of $44.99 per month.
 Now, ever since I switched to a lower speed plan, I rarely receive the advertised rates I pay for (consistently see speeds averaging 12/Mps), and am paying $10 more per month for half the speed I used to get (from 105 Mps to 50 Mps).

 Hello,
 I would like to add additional information regarding our Comcast account. We had a Comcast technician stop by on 6/25/2015 to try and diagnose the issues behind our very low speeds (12Mbps average - paying for 50Mbps). He was not able to find any issues, and during his visit, we were receiving the full 50+Mbps. Only a couple of hours later, our speeds dropped drastically back down to 10-12 Mbps - http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/941730544.png. I am not sure if our speeds are consistently being throttled, but ever since we were forced to switch plans, we rarely see over 20% of the speeds promised.
 We have tried everything, however Comcast is not willing to resolve the issue. We went from paying $34.99 a month for 105Mbps, to paying $45 a month for 50Mbps and only receiving an average of 12Mbps.
 All the best, (b) (6)

302,"I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 To Whom It May Concern,
 I have two items I’d like to address:
 - Merging of tickets:
 It looks like both of my requests have been merged into a single ticket. At first glance they’re both comcast issues and it makes sense to tie them together, but I believe those cover two very different behaviors and warrant different investigations. I have since received a voice mail from comcast which only addressed the exclusivity policy and not the throttling. Could we split these tickets up so that they can be once again addressed individually? I would also like the issue of Netflix throttling to be addressed.
 - Response to exclusivity:
 I received a voice mail from a comcast spokes person who made it clear that if I didn’t like this behavior I should contact my apartment complex rather than comcast. The reason I filed an FTC complaint and not a complaint with my apartment is because I have absolutely no power to understand the inner dealings of these contacts. If I complain to comcast they will just say it’s my apartment who brokered these deals, and if I go to my apartment complex they might even corroborate that version of the story. My hopes in filing this complaint were to make sure that I could believe these two third parties. I simply have no way of knowing for certain why I am being charged so much. I would still like the FTC to reassure me directly, rather than take these corporations at their word.
 Thank you for your help,

 I am writing you because after calling several times and attempting to speak with a supervisor and still no luck I am skipping the middle man and going straight to the top! I am sick of the lack of customer service your company provides! It all started when I contacted your company on behalf of my Grandmother because her TV has been blacking out every 3 minutes for a year now. She has called several times to get this resolved and still no one has fixed it so I stepped up to the plate. While on the phone I also questioned her bill that was $140 for TV and phone and they informed me she has internet which we canceled a year ago. Your
 Rep then informed me a technician while on the phone with her talked her into upgrading her plan. For one a technician should not ever be a sales rep because the last I checked their job was to fix not sell! So my grandmother changed her plan because she was assured this would solve her blacking out issue. This is very dishonest and tells me your company takes advantage of seniors and cares
 more about sales than customer service. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she told me it would be 72 hrs before I would speak to one which is also ridiculous! What company that values customer satisfaction has that type of policy? However I thought 72 hrs was long but it's now been almost 2 weeks and still no supervisor! I then called again and spoke to Danielle who set up for a technician to come and look at my grandmas TV this being the 3rd technician to come out and I asked if its not resolved what I would need to do to cancel. She told me there was no early termination fee because my grandma didn't sign a two year contract.( Guess your sales technician forgot to add that clause while selling her!) thank the Lord or so we thought! So the 3rd technician Michael Cox came out on Sunday June 7th and stayed for 4 hours he climbed the pole and changed out all of the connections and box and it still didn't fix the issues and continued to black out every 3 minutes! Danielle also assured me she would contact me and follow up with me Monday June 8th to tell me the amount I would be refunded for the TV blacking out and shocker she never did! So I then called And spoke to brittney who said there was no way of getting back in touch with Danielle which I know isn't true because each person I talk to is in your computer system and the calls are recorded! But I talked to brittney and she gave me her id number (952) so I could supposedly speak to her again which didn't work! She also assured me there was no ETF and I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor and she connected me finally after waiting 40 mins to Arimis who also assured me there was no $200 ETF because she didn't sign a contract and it was in the notes on my grandmas account that she wouldn't be charged! She also said all she could do was credit me $60 for my TV blacking out for a year which is such a tiny amount compared to the problems we have encountered! So now 3 of your employees on different occasions have assured me we wouldn't be charged an ETF! And when we went to our local Comcast in Brunswick Ga they told us there was no notation and that she would be charged an ETF! This infuriated me so I then contacted your company again and still no response from a supervisor so I have contacted the FCC and you.This is a company with no integrity and no customer service from my experience so far! I want to be credited for her lack of TV for a year and for the Internet we didn't know we had for a year and I want the $200 fee removed! Please contact me at

308,"Comcast is rolling out data limits on internet usage, but only in select markets through out their service area. The service area's selected are markets where Comcast faces little or no competition from other providers. These actions unfairly target Comcast customers who have no alternative options if they are dissatisfied with service or service limits provided. In addition tools provided by Comcast fail to adequately measure real time data usage , thus preventing customers from preventing additional charges. Data limits also fail to account for ""modern"" internet data usage from multiple devices, only tools provided are for PCs.

321,"Hello,
 I am having serious problems with Comcast, and when I try to contact them I am given the run around. My issues range from being stood up by technicians multiple times, being told i would be charged $20 for install and then being charged $200, paying for two lines of Internet in the same house but one is only half as fast as the other and they can't fix it and are charging me the same for both lines and claiming they are the same service, having am automated phone system that hangs up on you repeatedly and then a twitter support team who ignores you if they do set up an appointment with a tech they dont show. I could go on But i dont know how in depth to get.
 Please help, this is the most frustrating experience I have ever had with a service provider, and I know many people with similar issues with Comcast. Please help, they have been treating customers as expendabl While charging premium (even unnapproved, bogus charges at times).
 it's just plain wrong.

322,"I registered for a Comcast Internet/Cable package on 4-15-2015, see order confirmation attached. I originally ordered online then my order got cancelled, five times in a row. I also attached correspondence I had with a Comcast employee about the package and price I wanted. After all the back and forth I finally got the order confirmed with a phone representative for 74.94 (including HD technology fee and leased modem – 54.99/month base fee). Furthermore the agent told me to pickup my modem and cable box at my local Comcast store – 116 Beacon St. Somerville, MA 02144. When I got to the store, a woman at the counter told me that her colleagues on the help line are often wrong and that I should understand because Comcast is such a large national organizational. She cancelled my latest confirmation (I believe the 8th of the day) then went ahead and charged me a higher rate than I previously agreed with.
 I have now spent over 14 hours between setting up my order and trying to straighten out my billing. Every Comcast employee I talk to tells me a different story about the package. I simply just want a decent internet connection at a decent price and I shouldn’t have to go through this hassle to receive a basic commodity. The cable and premium packages were just a bonus as Comcast had a promotional deal. I believed I attached all the relevant forms but I would be willing to discuss my situation in great detail over the phone.
 Package I originally agree to:
 Blast Plus HBO package
 105 Mega bytes / second
 Basic cable
 12 months HBO free
 12 months Starz free
 free self install package

323,"I called in on April 20, 2015 to request for a cancellation of Comcast services at 101 1st St,
 Cambridge, MA 02141. I am closing this business location and moving out. The reason I did not call
 Comcast earlier was to avoid confusion or service interruption due to misunderstanding. Most service
 providers such as Verizon asked their customers not to call too early and better to wait until they are
 almost ready to move. I thought I was doing a good deed to Comcast to wait until timing was right to
 cancel services.
 I was dumbfounded to be told by the Comcast representative that the service could not be
 disconnected until late June. My account contract had already expired a long time ago. When I first
 signed up many years ago, I was never informed by the initial sales person that there was such a
 policy.
 After I presented my concern, the representative told me that in order to have the account closed
 effective 4/30/2015 I could send them a copy of lessor's official letter on company letterhead to prove
 that my business is moving out, as an alternative. I explained that I already had email conversations
 to prove that and there is no need for an official letter by the landlord, not to mention I never agreed to
 such a policy. I did NOT need to do this, but I had emailed the lessor and enclosed our emails here.
 The lessor thought it was ridiculous what Comcast asked. It was outrageous to spend hours and
 hours to follow Comcast's absurdity.
 I have always paid my invoices on time. We purchased our own modem and there is no equipment to
 return.
 I have written letters to Comcast to express my concern. I also faxed and emailed. Nobody replied. I
 have no other way to resolve this but have to come here for help. I simply want to make sure the
 Comcast service was canceled in the above location by April 30, 2015 and I shall not be billed for any
 service in this location after April 30, 2015. Any invoice prorated shall cover a period up to and only
 up to April 30, 2015. I really need to have a written confirmation by Comcast that the above is done.
 Given such a level of distrust on Comcast I cannot have any peace in mind until I see their final
 confirmation."
324,"12 days ago I called Comcast to request internet service for my new apartment. I spoke with my apartment building's ""Residential Comcast Consultant,"" Brian Leyden <brian_leyden@cable.comcast.com>. I was very clear that all I wanted was internet. No TV. No Phone. No Home Security. I just wanted internet. He says great, it will be $39.99/month for 105 mbps and drops off a internet self-install kit at my apartment complex. A few days later I attempt to activate the device with no luck so I call customer service. They inform me that the only service I've been signed up for is Basic Cable and that they're not sure how I got a wireless gateway in the first place becuase I was never signed up for internet service. I spend an hour on the phone with them while they fail to activate my service and device. Then they say they'll ship a new device to me overnight at no charge. The next day I get a bill for $175 that shows me being charged for basic cable that I never asked for, for the internet package I requested, for a $60 install service charge, and for the shipping cost of two devices, one of which is supposedly shipped overnight and the other shipped 3-5 business day speed. The device that was supposedly shipped overnight never arrived. 4 days later I get the standard shipping rate device. It doesn't work either. I call customer service again. They tell me I'll need to either go pick up a new device from a customer service center or have a tech come out for which they might charge me $50. I didn't think it was appropriate to be charged for a technician so I went to the customer service center and tried installing one last device. Of course it did not work so now I am scheduling a technician to come to my apartment and will have to fight to have fees removed after the fact. Now more than 10 days after I was promised internet service I have no service, I have wasted hours and hours of my life, and I have a series of completely nonsensical bills charging me for services, fees, and devices that I either never wanted, never received, or just plain did not work. Moreover, I have repeatedly contacted Brian to see if he can help resolve the issue and he has completely ignored me.

 Thank you for helping resolve my problem! This was awesome."
325,"I signed up with Comcast, my only choice for high speed internet required to do my job as a web developer upon moving to our new apartment in Cambridge, MA. My previous provider Verizon Fios was sadly not available and had far superior services in Arlington, MA.
 They offered an introductory bundle including TV cable services with HD and HBO bundled with their Blast! internet package ($60) which meets my needs for working from home and on-call. We haven't used the cable box for more than a few hours in the 3 years we've had the plan and it sits unplugged so that it's not wasting power. We use online services to watch any TV and movies we need, including HBO Go included with our subscription.
 After the introductory period ended, we saw no reason to continue paying for a service we don't use that sits unplugged and attempted to remove the cable TV service from our plan. I was told that we would have to cancel service entirely to retain just internet and that the price would be HIGHER for less services (just Internet) but the rep offered to give me a discount on my bill.
 Over the past year, Comcast has raised my bill from $80 to now over $100 without any notification or apparent reasoning as the bill doesn't state why their service prices keep going up. Internet alone would cost me up to $90 according to their representative and they offer no way to cancel online, only via phone and via a separate number you can only get by calling or contacting them first.
 I'd love to switch providers, or even have the opportunity to switch but there are no other providers in my area (unlike my electricity, gas utilities...) so Comcast is free to do whatever they want to my bill and service which due to my job I cannot work and earn a living without. This is an inexcusable state that we live in where companies can exist with an effective monopoly and use their pricing power to boost their numbers for the TV services just so I can have access to internet.
 The only way this has been somewhat tolerable is playing mind games with their support staff to get ""retention"" benefits which is a pointless and time wasting endeavor. NO ONE I know pays the same price for the same service as Comcast uses price to manipulate retention and customer service ratings.

327,"I recently canceled my cable because I only want internet service. At the time I was offered a bundle that included cable HBO and other channels that I do not want or need. The price for this package was $54.99 a month for 12 months after which the price would naturally increase. I should mention that I live in a community that has no other high speed service options so now I pay $72 dollars a month for high speed internet. I feel this is to high a price considering that Comcast will lower my bill if I take other services that will in time go up in price and land me back in a situation where I am paying for cable that I don't watch. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

328,"On June 15, 2015 I attempted to order Internet service from Comcast, the cable provider serving my area of Camino, CA, 95709, for my premise address of 2900 Observatory Drive, Camino, CA 95709.

 Please see the email string below. Comcast is demanding I pay a $535,000 fee in order to fulfill my order for 25Mbs Internet service. I believe requesting such a large sum in order to fulfill the order is in violation of Title II of the Communications Act and specifically Section 254(b)(3) requiring Internet Service Providers to provide access to advanced telecommunications in all regions of the nation at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.
 Additionally, this fee demand violates Section 202(a) of the Communications Act insofar as it is an unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory charge in order to effect a common carrier communications connection per Section 202(b).
 I appreciate the FCC's prompt response to this complaint. (b) (6)

329,"When I open my account with Comcast, their agent told me there is no Product Installation Fee/
 activation fee, I just need to pay the monthly fee $39.99. However, in the second/third month, they
 tried to charge my $33.20 installation fee, without any explanation. I contacted with Comcast
 customer service several times, at beginning there was no one told me anything about this fee, I felt
 that their agents are not aware of this fee neither. Finally, an agent explained my that I was charged
 for this installation fee, however this fee is not shown anywhere on their website, or their agent did
 not tell me I would be charged for this neither. I think they really should refund me that. I attached one
 of the chatting transcripts for your reference."
330,"About 2 months ago, intermittent Internet (and phone) outages became very frequent and were lasting up to a week. I was without service about 50% of the time. After multiple phone calls and two visits, Internet service was restored but they changed settings and my wireless router ceased to work. They replaced it with theirs, then replaced that with a new Comcast modem/router, but download speeds remain below 1 or 2 Mbps on all of my devices, except the TV which downloads at around 200 kb/s which equals about 1.6 Mbps. I have a wireless desktop, laptop, iPad, and work laptop, and have not been able to use them for anything more than checking email for two months. I have wasted days on the phone and waiting at home for visits with no results. The most recent visit that I waited for today was supposed to be between 3pm and 5pm. Instead, I got a phone call from the tech at 5 which lasted for 2 1/2 hours. He claimed he had not come to the house because he did not want Comcast to charge me for a service call. He asked stupid questions, and never seemed to understand the problem. Now I have another appointment for tomorrow morning for another service tech to come. Another morning wasted when I can't work.

331,"I have attempted to work with Xfinity to get my balance under control . I was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I was informed via an online chat that I could set up a payment plan. I had called the provided number and they simply told me I had to pay my full balance as it was all due then in order to have my service on. I reluctantly agreed to it. The Payment date of 06/03/2015 comes around and I have a $105 charge placed on my account from comcast. They state no charge exists in their system and it was not applied to my account and the additional FULL payment of $335.65 was still going to withdraw from my bank account. It was suggested I should contact my bank to remove the comcast payment, in which they would also block any incoming comcast payments on this day.
 then the rep online notified me that's an entire balance. Not just the past due balance. Why would i be told the balance in full if required, when it isnt all due. the rep i spoke with on the phone stated it all needed to be paid as if it was all past due. As of now I am still trying to speak with someone to hold my account on comcast, as i was on hold on their phone lines for over an hour until it told me then just closed and to call back tomorrow. Tomorrow will mean my rent check bounces and im evicted.
 I have absolutely never in my life been so lied to by a company. I recently am getting over a divorce and comcast is the ONLY one that basically said we dont care, not working with you. I do need this as my main line of communication with work. I sincerely hope this can be resolved, as they are quite reluctant to actually do anything to be such a great company. They are the only true high speed carrier in my area and they absolutely know it.

332,"I am paying for what Comcast claims is the highest internet speed to our home. However, when
 checked periodically internet speeds have never exceeded 20 Mb/s on the download and the upload
 is ever worse. Despite them claiming it is supposed to be around 50 Mb. Plus latency is high
 sometimes as much as a minute or two. Refer to attached copy of Xfinity letter asking me to
 exchange their old cable modem for a new one at ""no additional cost"". This occurred primarily after
 Comcast requested to installed the newest technology in cable modems and sent it to me for
 installation; it didn't work and then another one was installed by their own technician. Nobody ever
 mentioned in writing or verbally that Comcast had a new policy to limit total data usage to 300 Mbytes
 per month which they are now claiming we have to paid extra for. So, we get higher latency, slower
 speeds after 12 years of using the same old modem and have to pay more. Why? I have protested
 about their technical issues since the new modem was installed because it doesn't work well.
 Suddenly after installation, I started getting calls from Comcast's Security Customer Services
 indicating that I was about to meet the maximum data usage and will have to pay more. After several
 calls, nobody has ever indicated there was a limit of 300 Gbytes per month except this afternoon.
 This is a new contractual issue and a misrepresentation on the part of Comcast which was never
 approved by me verbally or in writing. When called in the past, they even told me to disregard the
 calls and not to worry about it.
 I am reporting this to the FCC as it MUST be looked into by your department because it is most likely
 being used in millions of other unsuspecting Comcast/Xfinity customers and households.
 FYI, I was using an old cable modem for over 12 years and Comcast sent me a letter asking me to
 change (see attached) it, claiming it was at no additional cost, for a new cable modem/router, which I
 later found out it also was broadcasting an Xfinity hot spot right from my house without my
 permission. The company claims to have now hundreds of thousands of internet hot spots, of which
 my cable modem, is one. This was NEVER authorized by me and I finally had it disable which the
 company conveniently forgot to tell me it was there to start with. I only found out about it when after
 complaining my speeds and latency have gone up and internet service is worse now than ever, their
 representative said that disabling their Xfinity hot spot would probably help and if it some after I was
 able to disable it.
 FCC, you must do something about these companies which continue to add charges without impunity
 and using lies and half-truths to charge more money to innocent customers which trust them in good
 faith. I have to watch their bills like a hawk because every other month or so they add items and costs
 which are not authorized by me.

 Dear FCC or Zendesk, whoever you are:
 Well, not surprised, I will see what Comcast has to say when their written note is received.
 What you are effectively telling me is that the FCC simply acts as a ""mail messenger"" or say a ""mail
 intermediary"" and does not evaluate whether the veracity, accuracy or legitimacy of Comcast's reply
 has any merit? By the same token, did you assess the veracity or accuracy of my complain or simply
 passed it on to Comcast? Probably, the latter is what you did. And then left it up to Comcast to offer a
 ""reply"" to me, which the FCC neither assessed nor investigated? Am I mistaken?
 I will reserve my judgment until their reply is received but it seems rather useless at this point. The
 agency the government has created to protect the consumer and ensure there is no abuse is merely,
 in this case, a ""pass-through"" non-entity. In other words, since the great majority of the population has
 no idea of your regulations and laws regarding telecommunication licenses, etc., you simply assume
 once Comcast or any company answers the problem (by definition) is resolved and closed. It seems
 to me you are being somewhat biblical and ""washing your hands"" out of this issue, without assessing
 if there was any validity to my complain or Comcast's answer. However, if my conclusion is incorrect,
 please do let me know ASAP.
 BTW, according to licensing arrangements, Comcast is apparently the only one authorized (a
 monopoly) to provide cable services in our county (other than satellite or an antenna for local
 stations) and I have no other options or recourse. I am curious to know, did Comcast showed you a
 signed copy of the contract or something which confirmed I agreed to this ""new"" internet service
 provision? Did you do any investigation? Have you investigated if the FCC received any other
 complains similar to mine? My guess is probably not. Correct? The FCC simply took Comcast's word
 and closed the complain. Is that it?
 Respectfully,

337,"I am in the Atlanta market. However, I'm far enough away from Atlanta that I only have one option for broadband Internet, and that's Comcast. In fact, I only have one other option, slower than the FCC's definition of broadband, for any Internet access at all.
 I'm in what Comcast calls a ""test market"" for its capped broadband Internet. They do not offer uncapped residential plans, so this is my only choice for Internet. They offer me a good speed (50mbps), but the cap is only 300GB per month. That means they only allow me to use that connection for the equivalent of 13 hours and 40 minutes each month, or a little under 2% of the month.
 The vast majority of my internet usage is streaming video: My wife and I follow baseball on MLB.TV (go Cards!), my sister in law lives with us and watches TV shows on Netflix during the day when she's not working, and another of their sisters is living with us for the summer and watching anime shows on Netflix after doing her summer school work.
 The Cardinals regularly play 25 games per month. At about 3 hours per game and, as MLB.TV advises, around 3mbps for the highest video quality (which they don't allow me to lower manually on the platform we use to stream it), each game is around 4 GB. That's 100 GB per month if we only watch the Cardinals games.
 Netflix runs about 3 GB per hour for HD video, which much of their content is. So if my sisters in law watch an average of 3 hours per day of Netflix content, they're blasting through another 270 GB. Even if they limit it to 2 hours that only leaves me with 20 GB of data to use for non-streaming Internet.
 If I buy one game in a month through GOG.com, Steam, Origin, or the PlayStation Store and have to download it, I'm over my quota and am automatically billed for my overage. An overage that, I have to point out, costs Comcast marginally nothing.
 That's what 300GB looks like for a modern family. And Comcast is penalizing us for getting our entertainment through means it can't compete with.
 I urge the FCC to take action against Comcast and protect the open and useful Internet I grew up with. I fear I won't recognize it if nobody holds companies like Comcast accountable.

339,"The area where I have internet service (metro-Atlanta) has a data cap that was put in place in 2013 for 300GB. Comcast is imposing this data cap in a market where there are no other viable competitors available. Thus, Comcast's actions are that of a monopoly and ultimately extortion.
 They are punishing and taxing us for data that we already pay for. For individuals that go over their monthly allotment, Comcast changes an additional $10 for 50GB. However, if you pay an additional $10, you get a plan that doubles the amount to 600GB. In a sense, Comcast is stating ""pay us more, and we'll stop charging you for data that wouldn't have charged additionally beforehand anyways"".
 These deployments are selective to areas that Comcast has a major hold on the market. Data caps are nothing but a inhibitor to creativity, enjoyment, and ultimately productivity of the American people. Comcast has imposed these fees and restrictions on our usage for the sole reason that they are future proofing their current market structure.
 Internet Service Providers understand that cable television is outdated, and more and more households are going to streaming services strictly. The data caps are a massive restriction that will hamper our ability to use the internet as it was intended.

340,"A technician came to my home to check the internet. Apparently there was an issue outside and also with my connection.
 The day after that, I have now always internet connectivity issues with my modem, which was working just fine. I called customer service, they sent a reset signal and told me that there is an issue with their system.
 Since the beginning I wanted to have a different internet provider, but, due to a non-competitive agreement between the apartment complex and Comcast, it is not allowed to have other company, hence service.
 Want to have my service up and running as I cannot perform my daily activities.

342,"Not only did it take almost 3 months to finally and completely shut off my service from Comcast, their own final statement shows that I returned all of my Comcast equipment on March 30th, 2015, but I was still charged for service for over a month after that.
 After my final personal interaction with them, on May 14th, 2015, they completely revoked access to my account, including all past information, leaving me with only the previously downloaded bills and statements to refute their charges.

343,"Comcast notified of three courtesy months of exceeding 500GB per month data usage. Yet, we incurred $10 Speed Boost charges after first month of using only 90% of 500GB. The speed boost charge is actually for data and this is deceiving to call it ""speed"". Secondly we incurred charges during the ""curtsey"" months. Monthly rate for modem lease jumped from $7 to $10 and it's the same equipment we've had for several years. Why should we pay more without being notified for equipment that's the same, not newer? Each time we attempt to call billing we're disconnected so I cannot speak with a representative about our billing inconsistencies.

344,"On February 11, 2014, I contacted Comcast/Xfinity via their web sales department inquiring about services. I was presented and agreed to a 2 year contract for the XF starter triple play bundle with an incentive of a $300 Visa gift card. A couple months later I called customer service regarding the gift card, as I had not received it, and I was told my account had to have 3 months if good standing before it would be processed (I was in good standing), and to check a gift card website for updates on when to expect it. I checked, and there was no record of me. Checked later, same. Well, life happened and I forgot about it until having to contract customer service recently for another issue. I was directed to an email, we_can_help@cable.comcast.com, for help. I wrote an email describing the situation, and received a call from Barbara, apparently an executive customer service agent (phone number 888-966-7794 x3014459) looking to resolve the issue. I was told, in so many words, I am a liar. There is no record of my accepting that incentive after reviewing my history. I would have had to call and have a verbal agreement for the gift card. Nothing of the sort was ever asked or explained to me when I had ordered from the agent. She then informs me that they didn't even put me on contract, I was signed up for a completely different promotion. She also let me know that I should have known that if I looked through all my paperwork I got after my agent to sign up that I didn't get the incentive, because, ""that's what I would have done."" Insulting my abilities as a consumer. She informed me that she's sorry but there's nothing that can be done because there is no record of anything abs they can't check with the agents for transcripts of the initial correspondence with the agent where I agreed to the contract because they don't keep them in file, and even suggested I should have kept that transcript myself. I trusted blindly, I guess. Well, it's a bait and switch regardless.

In addition to this, my receipt of the check would have been impossible because they (Comcast) sent it to the wrong address multiple times.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/28/2015 1:09:45 PM:
 Thank you for your assistance with my complaint #363169. I received the copy of Comcast's answer to your inquiry and have found their account of our interaction to be inaccurate. I wish to clarify my concerns and restate that my assertion that Comcast manipulates prices and performance. Despite their indication otherwise, my complaint remains unresolved. (b) (6)
 Comcast wrote to the FCC that I requested a promotional offer; I did not. I requested fair pricing for a la carte Internet service, whereby the price for standalone high speed internet service is less than equivalent Internet service that is bundled with cable television and landline telephone service. Comcast continues to manipulate Internet pricing in an effort to bolster its subscriptions to Cable Television, most likely in an effort to artificially improve its advertising viewership claims. Comcast's offer to discount my Internet subscription for one year does lower my price, however this temporary accommodation in no way alleviates nor addresses the actual issue of unfair price manipulation to the masses who have not complained to the FCC.
 Secondly, Comcast indicates that it provided a courtesy credit to my account to remunerate me for making multiple calls to their customer service line. This $180 credit was requested by me for a different reason. It is a partial reimbursement for overcharges for the past 24 months whereby Comcast charged me for high speed Internet service of 75mbs or higher, yet provided service of substantially inferior speeds (due to poorly maintained equipment in my neighborhood). Comcast has repaired their cables and their promised service delivery standards are now being met. Comcast did not offer the partial reimbursement for over charges, rather it provided the credit only upon my insistence.
 Regards, (b) (6)"
349,"I have been having problems with Comcast in billing issues.
 The problem is Comcast when opening a new account by default sets the account to ECO Billing without informing its customers. The customer has to remove a small dot from web page in order to receive a paper bill for services ordered.
 Additionally, Comcast does not inform the customer when the billing cycle is and never notifies the customer that the bill is available and where it can look at.
 In fact I never even had access to the Comcast web page do problems with Comcast log in for some 6 months.
 I have been trying to figure out past billing do to Comcast imposing late fee billing, which Comcast refuses to address.
 It has taken me some 12 months to get off of ECO Billing and that only happen because I had to call the CEO Office of Comcast and that took some 8 calls before it was done.
 I still have not received any of the past bills and just how the late fees were calculated.
 Comcast also during this time frame I paid for services that I did not received and also billed for services that they did not disclosed and I contested these facts and they did give some adjustments

350,"I have been struggling for the last three months to try to get the internet speeds that Comcast has
 promised me. Every time I call, Comcast is reluctant to do anything but reset my modem. Clearly after
 the 50th time of resetting my modem, they should conclude that it will not reset my modem. They had
 recently sent a technician to my home. The technician was incredibly rude and poorly educated. He
 said, ""Everything on Comcast's side looks fine so clearly this is your issue."" Then exited my property
 indifferently. I am tired of paying for a service I am not receiving. With that being said, I would like
 Comcast to be forced to solve this issue immediately. On top of that, I desire three months of my
 ""services"" to be credited back into the account as I had not been receiving them."

I have called comcast time and time again and they send a signal and 30 minutes later I have no connection again. Every single time I call they do the same exact thing and tell me it will work and sure eno it doesn't.

352,"Comcast is merely a provider of service and doesn't own the internet. With this move customers will actually come out better with the data plans they have set up for their phones versus what Comcast is offering. Comcast pays nothing for the bandwith they use, yet they want to increased the cost to customers for data usage because they know they can get away with it. This is merely a ploy to protect tv/cable providers who have been losing customers and money for some time now and to make up for the money lost.

356,"I believe Comcast is unfairly inflating their customers' internet usage and charging them overages that aren't actually occurring. I have seen my internet usage in Georgia approach the 'cap' every month and started noticing that the internet meter was still climbing (both on Comcast's website and the desktop app) even when all of the computers in the house were turned off while we have been out of town.
 This made me curious and I have done a few experiments in the past few weeks. I completely disconnected my Comcast cable modem from both the incoming cable and the power outlet, so the modem is completely turned off and no possibility of data usage should occur. I did this for a week. I made a note of the internet usage reported the next day from work (to make sure that the meter had completely updated). I then checked it a week later, and it had reported that I had used 28 GB of data. This is not possible. I did the same experiment a few weeks later, and it showed a usage of 19 GB. How is this physically possible? Comcast either has a major problem with their metering or they are intentionally inflating usage to cause charges for exceeding the cap.
 I have started looking at some of the forums online and am finding that other users are experiencing similar issues.
 Comcast should be investigated on this issue immediately. There is no actual justification for the data cap other than to take advantage of people's ignorance to how the internet works.
 I don't wish to give my full information at this time as I fear Comcast will harass me for reporting this.

357,"I live in an area where Comcast is our only option for high speed internet access. I am a graphic designer, and transfer large files over the internet for work. I spoke with Comcast in the last year, and asked what I could do to get my data limit raised, even if it costed me money. I was told that if I upgraded my internet speeds to the ""extreme 105"" plan, I would be given double the usual 300gb/month limit, 600gb/month. I agreed to this plan, and got the corresponding monthly charge increase. Comcast has since denied any knowledge of this conversation, and claims that it isn't possible for me to receive this data increase and I must be misunderstood about what the previous representative claimed. I know for a fact that I am not mistaken, because I made sure to confirm this claim with multiple representatives before I agreed to the monthly cost increase. Now, I am stuck with extremely fast internet access, but the same data cap I was willing to pay to avoid. I was lied to by multiple representatives of Comcast, but they know they are my only option and they do not care if I am unsatisfied with their service. they have a monopoly on high speed access in my area and they are abusing their power.

 I couldn't see the details of my new plan until nearly a month later when the next billing cycle started. I discovered that Comcast was charging me $70 a month for this new package, with $8 in fees and taxes that they are required to offer.

359,"Several months ago I called Comcast because Internet connection fails, downloads are slow and
 sometimes the TV does not receive a signal. The Representative told me that the problem was on my
 end due to a faulty connection. I investigated and eventually opened the concrete box where the
 Comcast connection comes in from near the sidewalk in front of my house. The cable inside this
 concrete box comes out of a tube which is an inch or so in diameter. This tube is full of water. Where
 the two cables go into another tube the end is covered in mud. See attached photo. I speculate that
 this could be an issue of the faulty connection on my end. Also, this concrete box is 5 inches tall and
 has presented a tripping hazard. I have contacted Comcast six times now asking for resolution of
 these issues. I started using Comcast's chat session so that I could keep record of the contacts. Each

 hours. The last chat session with Comcast was last night and the chat session was terminated
 because of poor Internet connection. No technician has come out to even look at this issue.

 Thank you.
 I am so very happy that you are helping me on this issue. I was talking to a neighbor the day after I
 requested your help and a Comcast service truck drove past my house. So, I do know Comcast's
 service trucks visit my neighborhood even if they do not stop.
 Best,

 I do not understand why my complaint is closed when Comcast has done nothing to resolve the
 issue.
 The cable coming in from the street/sidewalk area is still submerged in water and the cable
 connection concrete box is still too high and presents a tripping hazard.

360,"On 6/1/15, broadband service became extremely irregular ie. slowdown, loss of signal, back up at reduced speeds, down again, etc. After rebooting my router and modem several time I finally felt it was time to contact the customer support group at Comcast, my provider. I called 611 (I am a Comcast Phone subscriber and that is the best way to reach them) and immediately was disconnected. I called again and received a voice message stating ""No one was available at the moment"" and to ""Call back later"". Out of frustration I called 00 on my phone to reach a Comcast operator - after waiting for 3 minutes an operator came on line and immediately asked if I was calling regarding my broadband service disruption. I replied ""Yes"" and after I reviewed what happened when trying to contact Customer Service, she stated ""Customer Service has turned off their system as they feel they are overloaded with calls"". My reply, ""yeah, that's great Customer Service""! Amazingly the phone operator agreed with me. She courteously went on to say the outage was extensive covering most if not all of CA an perhaps other Western States. I thanked her for her courtesy and taking the time to share with me the service issue.
 Thank you for not allowing the Comcast/OTW merger to go through. It is bad enough dealing with Comcast and OTW individually - Imagine what a disaster it would have been as a merged monopoly.
 Sincerely
 Cazadero CA 95421

361,"First Comcast disconnected my internet/phone without authorization , this occurred during a move. We were still charged a early termination fee of $90. As attempt to remedy the unlawful disconnect the original 2 year contract for a fixed rate of 39.99 for phone/internet services special was offered and contracted into at the new address. I was given a self install kit which turned out to be in non working condition. I spent at least 40 hours attempting to get service with Comcast employees on this faulty box. Finally a Technician who knew what they were doing was able to determine the box not working. I was asked to return box (an 3 hour commute) when I was given a new box but while attempting to get services, I was informed that unless I paid 60.00 dollars for an alleged bill form somewhere in the past that I had no prior knowledge of I could not get services on. This was going on 6 weeks of daily attempts to initiate service so I was forced to pay the amount without researching the validity of charge. A family member has a medical condition which emergency services have been needed and could not risk being without a phone any longer. The new box and the alleged 60.00 charge changed the account number twice. Both times I was assured by every Comcast employee that I spoke with that the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 was still in effect.
 I received a call from on the the Comcast employees who attempted to trick me into contracting into a different service agreement with service fees that were incrementally raised every 6 months. I CLEARLY DECLINED THIS OFFER why would I enter into a contract that was not as good as the one that I had with Comcast. f It was beginning to appear as if Comcast was attempting to break the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 contract by whatever means possible. Comcast monthly fee are paid by automatic withdraw from a account that a Payee of mine pays. She had been unable to resolve the escalating fee indicated that Comcast was not upholding the contract with me. In a trip another 3 hour commute I spoke with the Comcast employee who instituted the 2 year 39.99 month rate. HE remembered the original agreement and states the issue would be rectified in 3 days and gave me a Confirmation number reflecting such. This was after many more hours spent by me on this issue including long chart with a Supervisor who stated I just needed to go to the local office. The bill was never adjusted. The Supervisor at the local office does not respond to my emails as promised more time spent on this issue. The bill has now escalated so high that the Comcast employees have actually said I'm being ripped off for the services I'm getting. I now not only want amends with bill adjusted retroactively to reflect the contracted amount of 39.99 for 2 years and reimbursement for the overcharging but to be compensated for the extreme amount of hours spent on this issue.

362,"Comcast's justification for business pricing is that the service is bundled with a bunch of tools that we do not, and never will use (and are generally useless). We requested that we have home internet at our business, but they say that is not possible. In addition to this, Comcast will lower home internet prices even more if you threaten to cancel every year, which itself is a shady practice. The result is that business internet is about three times more expensive for the exact same home service. If there were real competition, we would not face this issue, and pricing would be more reasonable.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/30/2015 6:14:22 PM:
 Christine Nussbaum from Comcast contacted me regarding this complaint.
 My complaint is that Comcast charges nearly twice as much for commercial bandwidth as it does for residential bandwidth, and that there is no difference between the commercial and residential product.
 Christine noted that is was only Comcast internal policy that dictated this pricing.
 Their justification for the commercial pricing is that the building is zoned commercial, and that is how their pricing works. The only difference that she could state between the commercial and residential service is that if there were to be a service call, that they would address it right away.
 I noted that there is no competition in our area that has the bandwidth we need for our business. Comcast is our only option.
 Christine stated that there is competition from Century Link. I explained that they cannot provide the bandwidth we need. She insisted that the amount of bandwidth is irrelevant, and that Century Link is indeed competition.
 The only conclusion that a reasonable person could reach is that Comcast knows that there is no competition at that bandwidth, and so they have decided to price gouge.
 Thank you for your consideration.

365,"Greetings good people of the FCC, my name is and I am filing a complaint in regard to
 Comcast's imposing of data caps on users not only in the Atlanta area, but nationwide. In this widely
 connected digital age, a consistent availability of online service is a cornerstone of American life. That
 aside, it is simply outrageous that paid for residential services in particular have data caps. Many
 people have families, multiple using online devices and services at a time. This quickly consumes
 data, and it is detrimental to consumer relations that such data caps exist, as they clearly do not take
 this into any regard.
 Atlanta is one of the largest metro areas in the country, and it is simply absurd for data caps to exist
 in significant area of the United States. Additionally, it is an exploitative measure I feel, in order to
 undermine alternatives to traditional TV services such as Netflix, and discourage consumers that pay
 for their internet service to pursue such means of entertainment. It is not at all indicative of keeping up
 with the current technologies and services of 2015 and beyond. Everything is connected: game
 consoles, phones, televisions, and even watches. This trend will only magnify in the coming years.
 Data caps are stifling to the current needs and the future potential of such matters.
 With innovative streaming services such as Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon, and many channels
 themselves offering streaming of their own content through online services, there are individuals like
 myself that wish to get their entertainment through the use of such services as opposed to traditional
 TV. Comcast is intentionally trying to stifle such competition I feel through the data caps. Not only do
 I find this unethical, I feel it should be illegal. I do hope the good people at the FCC do take an active
 interest and effort to combat these data caps, as they have no place in a technologically advanced
 society like the United States.
 Please strongly take my words into consideration and thank you for your time.
 Sincerely,"

368,"I was charged for a service fee when I requested a technician to come out to fix my internet due to lost of connectivity constantly. Initially, the first technician claims that it was my splitter that was causing the connectivity issue. After a week, the problem persist so I called the customer service to report the recurring incident. They say they will send out a ""senior technician"" to take a look. Finally, the technician said there was an issue with the line connection out by the street where it runs a line to my house. He fixed the issue and the company billed me for the repair. In my opinion, this is a infrastructure repair cost and the customer is not responsible for the repair cost. As a customer, I pay a monthly subscription fee to have a working internet and should not be responsible for upkeep of their infrastructure to provide that service for me. In addition, not to mention the terrible customer service from their call center. I was told that they will investigate my issue and give a call in return. Two weeks later and there was still no call so I followed up. Not only I was told that the company does not give call back to their customers and that my billing concern was resolved. So in conclusion, I was deceived and lied to by customer service representative and I was unethically charged for a service to fix their infrastructure to provide me with internet service that I should have with my monthly subscriptions.

369,"I would like to bring to your attention, as I am sure many have done before, the terrible practice of Comcast instituting data caps of 300gb. I happen to be in one of their test cities, and I can tell you that the data cap limit they want to eventually bring nation wide, is not only anti consumer, but spits in the face of Net Neutrality. I don't have tons of options as far as ISP's go, so Comcast is what I'm stuck with. So much of the modern daily life is spent utilizing the internet, it almost seems impossible to live without it. Putting a cap on the amount of data we are allowed to use is allowing Comcast to tell us how we need to live our lives. People who do a lot of work at home, and are constantly downloading, uploading and transferring files, making video calls and even working online. Damn near everyone consumed digital media, whether it be on a PC, smartphone or tablet. Watching videos, playing games, keeping in touch with the rest of the world. Why should Comcast have the power to dictate how what I can do and when? Data caps have been and will continue to be a disruptions in the every day lives of consumers everywhere. I can't even sit down and enjoy a movie via Netflix in my free-time without the fear that it might take up precious bandwidth. Data caps are, in a word, bullshit. I hope that you all at the FCC are able to see what a terrible precedent data caps would be. Companies being paid for the usage of bandwidth is one thing, but placing arbitrary limits on ones usage and charging overage fees is a clear example of milking the consumer for all they have. Please help stop the caps.

370,"Dear FCC,
 As with previous experience with Comcast, I was not surprised this time around to once again have a problem with them. After arguing my bill going up without notice (almost doubling), I decided to go ahead and cancel my service early as I was moving out anyway. The bill, $76.95, was auto-drafted on 5/30 for service that was set to run May 11th-June 10th. I called Comcast on 5/28 and told them to cancel service on 5/29. So the $76.95 would have been an incorrect amount. Now Comcast tells me that I have to wait 30-45 days for a technician to ""physically disconnect"" service before the adjustment is posted and the credit is give. This is a rental property so I have no idea what a technician needs to do at a property where the new tenants likely have Comcast service already. Additionally, they don't have to come out to activate my service so they shouldn't need to come out to turn it off. This is criminal. They wrongfully took money they knew was incorrect. If this were not routing through my roommates account I would walk down to the bank right now and do a chargeback. I would also like to point out that this was not explained to me when I canceled that this would happen. I was also told that the auto-draft would NOT process because of this. So they lied and took out the wrong amount. Talking with them via live chat seems like there is nothing I can do.
 Sincerely,
 and authorized user on this Comcast account)

371,"Our house has not one but two comcast internet boxes and both deliver less than average quality. Probably about 10 times a day, the internet box will kick off devices for absolutely no reason. This has been happening since November 2014. Basically when we are in the middle of browsing or streaming, the internet will stop working and according to the computer, I am connected to the network but have no internet connection. I then have to disconnect and reconnect. Once in a while, it won't even let me reconnect. I have had comcast come out to our house twice and tried to explain our issues but somehow the geniuses over at comcast can't understand the problem or the magnifying frustration that it causes. The Comcast tech guys tell me they see no problem and that it must be my computer. But this problem on happens with the comcast box internet, not any other network I try and conncet to. Furthermore, it happens to every device in our house including ipads, iphones, macs, and windows computers. Why is it so difficult for comcast to provide internet that is good quality. Also, when we moved into our apartment in August, it took comcast 17 days to finally come out and set up our internet even though I called a month in advance and they assured me that I could set it up my self despite the house never been wired for comcast before. I honestly think we need a new internet box and I tried to telling comcast that but they didn't listen to me. If I could switch to a different provider I would.

374,"I live in a condo/apartment community that has negotiated with Comcast for cable television, so a type of basic cable TV service is included with my rent. When I moved here initially, I was given a promotional rate of $40 for the Performance tier of Internet service. After a year, the price for the service increased to $65, which I take to be the standard price for unbundled cable Internet. I called Comcast and they agreed to reduce the monthly price to $53.
 I've not had any particular problems with the Internet service, but I still feel as if Comcast is using my situation against me. Because the TV is effectively coming to me separately, I can't get a package deal unless I add phone (which I don't need) or premium cable channels (which I also don't need). As a result, I end up paying for Internet as if it were my only service. However, since the cable connection to my unit has to be on because of the agreement with the HOA, it is hard for me to see how the marginal increase in service by adding Internet is costing Comcast $53/month. I have my own equipment (both modem and router) as well, so the $53/month seems to be merely for the (modest) Internet speeds I get. Like many users, I find Comcast's added services (e.g. email) extraneous, and probably the only service I even monthly is streaming live TV online (which actually requires the TV package and not merely the Internet).
 I don't have much negotiating power with Comcast because the alternative ISP is a mediocre DSL connection through the local phone company. Since the cable service to my unit is negotiated through the HOA, it's hard to imagine how there will be any serious competition in my complex anytime soon. A company in the area is working on building out a fiber network, but I expect it to be a long time before they are even close to my place.
 In addition, about a year ago, Comcast began encrypting their cable TV signal to my unit. I had to appeal to current FCC rules regarding encryption in order to maintain the HD signal for local channels. I now have two cable boxes attached to the same TV--the standard set top, and the HD decrypter--in order to keep the level of service that I had when I moved in. Comcast wants $20/month more to combine these two into a single HD cable box.
 In sum, Comcast is my only serious option, and they appear to know that and have benefited from my weak negotiating position.

377,"I have a bundle serivce with Comcast for which includes TV and phone aside from Internet. Comcast Charge me for equipment that was never installed by the technician. For the past 4 to 5 months I've been calling multiple times a month to get reimbursed for the 250 dollars they charged me. The Over charge I've recieved was from Home Security and everytime I've called I get told that I need to talk to somone in Home security but whenever I do they tell me that there is a Note in the system saying the amount that needs to be reimbursed and waiting on manager approval do to the amount and the next billing cycle it should take affect. Every month I have my service disconencted due to chargers that was an error from Comcast, every month I've been having to pay reconnection fees and when I talk to a representative they tell me the same thing and I never get the reimbursent. This past Monday I had my service disconnected yet again the day before an importan exam I was taking the cost me 600 dollars. Instead of studying I spent atleast 3 or 4 hours dealing with comcast to try and fix this issue which lead to me failing. The following day after spending hours with a representative I was told that everything was taking care of and my service was brought back up, then again the my service was disconnected. I am beyond frustrated and If it wasn't for the fact that I don't really have a choice for another service provider I would have left comcast. Everytime I've tried to talk to a manager I've not been able to, no paying customer should go through what I have gone through and even still have the same issue.

381,"Last year I moved to Indiana, and when I had Comcast Internet setup, they asked to check my credit. I allowed this, as I did not realize it would be a hard inquiry and could affect my credit. The job in Indiana did not work out, and I moved back to Virginia, and set up Comcast Internet there. This resulted in another hard inquiry. This has affected my credit, such as the deposit amount required when I moved to my new apartment. I feel Comcast should not be allowed to place a hard inquiry to set up Internet service for a customer. If this cannot be changed, they should at least have to explain in more detail how it can affect your credit. If I was aware of this, I would have asked about other options.

382,"Comcast communications is jamming the wireless signal and is not providing the mega bytes that
 customers are paying for. my wireless cell phone was not able to utilize the wireless signal/internet to
 search the google maps. the error code stated that the internet speed was too slow. I then checked
 the speed that is comming into the system (at the actual computer) utilizing 2Wire.com and the
 reading was 2.5mb. We are paying for 25mb. Comcast will direct their customers to their site to
 perform the speed test to get a false result.
 a few weeks ago Comcast did send the technician to our home to address the many complaints that
 we are having with their service. They charged me $40 for the 2 visits to fix the problem that THEY
 are having with the service. they said the problem was my Modem. They installed their modem
 (Comcast) and we are still having problems. This should be criminal for them to charge for a service
 visit to fix a problem that they are having with their system.
 WHY am I paying Taxes and funding the FCC if contractors are allowed to extort customers at will?
 This is WRONG! Comcast is jamming the full use of the wireless capability of the internet. Internet is
 defined as (a network of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, WIRELESS, and
 optical networking Technology )."

384,"We set up our new address and activation through the Comcast website about a month before we moved on June 1st 2015. 2 weeks ago we were contacted by a customer service representative about installation and was told our new home was set up for service; all we had to do was plug everything in and call to activate. We moved and set up everything on June 2nd, called the activation line and after 2 hours was told our internet box was the wrong one for our area. They gave us an address for a office near our new home and business hours. We drive there and the office has moved 10 miles further than the address given to us. Which isn't a big deal but, the customer line should have known since that location has been open since March... We get there and everything seems fine EXCEPT, the customer service line has put in an order for a self install kit to be mailed to us...after we were told to drive to the location. We call to have the kit canceled so we could just pick it up while we are there. It takes 3 calls for someone to actually pick up the phone after the automated system (all we could hear is talking in the background). The representative (that didn't disclose her name) said that they couldn't cancel the order since, she would have to start over completely if she did. Mark (the rep at the xfinity store) ended up speaking to her, he tried to explain the situation and she still denied help. Supervisors got involved at this point (they were very quite about what transpired) after about 30 mins we left with new equipment to be installed at home. We bring the equipment home and begin the installation, the Internet doesn't connect after 20 mins. We call back speak to a tech, she does everything she can and then tells us our home is not set up for Comcast! She sets up for a tech to come out, the tech will not be here until the 11th! We are now going into 2 weeks with a service that I think we over pay for. This has been one of the most stressful moving experiences of our lives. It seems like they don't care if they loose our business, I just hope that someone does something about this company's level of care for their customer. We will be sending out warnings to every customer we come across and hope that they finally realize how much they actually impact already stressful situations. The only good thing I can say about this company is that the Hull St location in Chesterfield, Va was fantastic.

387,"Hello,
 After being a Comcast customer for over 7 years I am finished. Watching my bill steadily climb as rapidly as the percentage of network downtime, and receiving no solution after numerous repair visits and several where no one ever bothered to show up.
 Having a home based business, I couldn't deal with the 4-12 hour internet outages which were occurring 2-3 times a month last year on the Residential side last year, so, in February I switched to Comcast business services with promises of better support and uptime which ACTUALLY appears to be true. The salesman also assured me my bill would be very close to my current Residential price, but alas, my new bill is apparently $537.67 for Business class phone and internet and an additional $242.26 for television from the Residential side. Starting at the $99.00 Triple Play bundle, I'd say that's a pretty impressive price increase curve. After some investigation, It seemed like a simple mix-up, Residential never was informed of the switch, so had continued to pay my monthly $242.00 bill, and now the Business side wants me to pay for the last three months of service all at once (Yes, the same three months I've already paid through my triple play package), but apparently none of the employees at either Comcast Residential or Business Services can figure things out.
 Over the past 3 months, I have spent over 26 hours on the phone with over 20 Comcast employees (9 just today) trying to explain the billing mistake, as well as correct service problems after the initial switch to Business Class. Comcast is not willing to refund anything at this time, even the 10 minutes of on-site installation which was billed at $49.00 and switch fee of $99.00 which resulted in no internet or phone service for 4 days.
 Today, after 4 hours on the phone, I was finally guaranteed corrections to the billing error by a representative of the Chicago Retention office, but oddly, she couldn't figure out how much of a correction, or what my combined monthly bills will be after the fix. She also could not provide me with an incident number, account number for my Business service (which nobody seems to have), or any single person or department to follow up with once the corrections were made.
 Sincerely,
 .
 Chicago, IL 60647 (b) (6)

388,"My medical office had Comcast business internet for several years. A year ago I retired and closed the office when I turned 75. I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right. Big Corporations lie and cheat people and think nobody will stop them. Have they no shame?

389,"On January 6, 2015 I telephoned comcast to disconnect my service at a small business of which I owned. They said I needed to sign a disconnect notice and it would take 60 days to shut off the service. I gave them my e mail address and asked them to send the paperwork. On January 8th the paperwork still was not received so I telephoned again. Once again I was assured that they would send the paperwork though my e mail address, once again it was not received. On January 13th another phone call was made, this time I asked the gentleman to stay on the line with me to make sure all paperwork was received. He did. I received the paperwork (with him on the line) filled out the paperwork, and waited until he received it before I hung up the phone. I was told he had received it, and I was also told the disconnection would take place on March 14, 2015.
 The shop closed, and I personally took the equipment back to the Comcast building, once there I asked if there was any other money that I owed to make sure things would close smoothly on March 14th. The person behind the counter told me she had no shut off for me on March 14th. I went out to the parking lot and called the comcast 800 number to find out what was going on. They told me they did not have any shut off for my account. Then assured me once again that it must be some type of internal mistake and it would be closed on March 14th. At that time I had received what I thought would be my last comcast bill before closing. I asked if I should pay it and they told me no, just to wait until I receive the final bill and settle it all then. I waited.
 At the end of February beginning on March I upgraded my personal Comcast account and had more equipment I had to return. I also received a bill from comcast which I thought was my final bill. But the bill also had a $20.00 late charge on it. I returned my personal equipment and called Comcast to complain about the late charge. They once again said they did not have the shut off on the books but it must be an internal mistake they will make sure all is shut off by March 14th. They also at that time waived the $20.00 late charge and told me I should pay the bill pending. I went back into the building and paid the bill.
 I thought was was done with until I opened my e mail on April 12th, that told me I was pass due on my account and owed $300.00!!!! I once again telephoned Comcast to be told that no one ever received a disconnect order but they would put it in right away so that the disconnection would happen on April 13th and a supervisor would call me back to discuss the $300.00 bill I refuse to pay. Once again I stayed on the line, once again the young lady assured me that she received the disconnect document and it will all be done by tomorrow April 14th.
 Once again I called on April 14th to make sure this was all done with, once again the same story, they never received the document. Once again filled it out , once again waited until until the person on the other line received it, but this time I received a confirmation that it was received. And now he is telling me it will take 60 days to complete and I am to pay for these services. Once again a supervisor was to call back.
 I called again today, was told it was not disconnected as of yet, was once again told a supervisor will call back, I am not holding my breath.
 I need this madness to stop! Why would I have returned all of the equipment on Feb 4th if I was still using this?
 I have no idea where else to turn. I do not feel I owe them another penny.
 Thank you

390,"Dear FCC (Tom Wheeler),
 I'd like to start by saying please make the internet a 'Title II'. Comcast's customer service is terrible. I mean I don't really need to give any examples because as I'm sure you're fully aware but they practice fraudulent billing techniques , throttle speeds, and place data caps. In the passed I've had all those things happens. My bill every month went up exponentially which has forced me to cancel with them more than once but I have to keep coming back because they basically hold a monopoly (we need more Antitrust policies) . My area, Chicago doesn't have a 'data cap' or 'data threshold' yet without fail at the end of the my connection speeds suddenly drop drastically. I'm paying for 100mpbs and they give me 5mpbs usually this is because of some sort of data cap and or threshold which was not advertised upon the agreement. I'm not only one who was trouble with this terrible company. I refer to you to the popular website reddit.com. They have a section dedicated to people who have trouble with comcast (http://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/). Please Mr. Wheeler do something about this company and anyone and everyone who practices fraudulent business practices. It's ridiculous and laughable that we being the United States of America have the worst internet out of all of the first world countries. It's also ridiculous that there are some third world countries who have our same internet speeds or better.

391,"Regarding the statement ""Video clips and outtakes are not required to be captioned when shown on the Internet."", this seems to miss the point of providing captioned content. Many websites (such as ESPN.com and Grantland.com) utilize short video clips and podcasts, which make up almost half of their available content, and would provide for a much more enjoyable experience if we, the deaf, could understand what was being said. This statement is outdated and needs revision.

 Good Afternoon,
 Thank you for contacting the Federal Commission Commission (FCC).
 • FCC rules cover full-length video programming. Video clips and outtakes are not required to be captioned when shown on the Internet. However, when a captioned TV program is re-shown on the
 Internet in segments, it must be captioned if substantial portions of the entire program are shown in those segments.
 • Consumer-generated media (e.g., homemade videos) shown on the Internet are not required to be captioned, unless it has been shown on TV with captions.
 • Movies shown on the Internet are not required to be captioned unless they have been shown on TV with captions.

394,"I've made multiple payment arrangements and everytime they never end up following through, then disconnect my services. I then call and get bounced around to an average of 6 ppl. Finally I get someone and they say it was never in the system. Then they took my payment for $224.42 and when I check later they decided to charge me that amount twice. Causing my account to go negative. Of course they're going to charge me for reactivation fees etc. Every month, every time it's the same call I have to make and they never seem to get it right. No matter if I go on Twitter or any other social media options. I don't know how they are still in business. I'm basically paying car payment prices just for cable and internet. These people are real crooks.

395,"Since past 5 months, the internet connection is extremely poor. There is problems of intermittent disconnection, meaning internet would just stop working for 5-10 seconds then would start working again. But this would happen every 1-2 minutes, hence it is very difficult to use internet. I have complaint about this to comcast atleast 6-8 times, but they are giving me excuses and not doing their job. I file an official complaint but they do not follow up ever. Please help me get good internet and I want compensation for the harrassment of time, and money.

396,"Hello,
 I am having ongoing trouble connecting wirelessly to the internet. This has been happening for over a year. My internet speed runs slowly even though we have the fastest residential speed through Comcast. Our wifi signal is constantly looking for a signal. Also, our internet connection just bumps us off the internet throughout the day, every day. I would say that it happens more often during the evening hours. We live in a modest sized home, and do not have more than two cell phones, one iPad, and one computer. This issue happens on all of our devices, as well as with the devices brought in by any guests that may be visiting/trying to use our homes wireless connection. I gave called Comcast in regards to this matter, and they have now referred me to your site. Hopefully you can help my family out in regards to these issues. Thank you so much for your time :-)

397,"I was experiencing problems with my internet, so I called Comcast to help mend the issuue. They ran
 me through a few basic troublshooting issues and when that didn't work they said they can send a
 workman out to my house. I asked how much that would cost and i was told $40. The workman
 showed up, and did next to nothing. He told us we needed to buy a completely new router, and he
 left, without the problem being fixed. I then decided to simply change the wifi channel that my internet
 was on and that solved the problem. I was charged $70 from Comcast to have a workman come out
 and do absolutely nothing. I am so tired of this company and would sooner get rid of cable all together
 then to continue my service. I feel completely ripped off and devalued as a customer."
398,"Consumer has bundled internet and cable service with Comcast. She is a victim of bait and switch;
 her monthly rate continues to escalate for the same services. She started out with the internet
 essentials at $9.95/mo; her cable has increased from $14.95/mo when she signed on to $59.99/mo.
 When she signed up she was told 2 cable boxes were included free but now she’s being billed for
 them. She’s billed for TV Guide which she never wanted; she asked them to take the charge off, they
 stated they would eliminate the charge but they never did. She wanted to disconnect her cable
 service because she cannot afford these increases. Yesterday, when she called in she had difficulty
 terminating the cable service and today it is still not shut off. As a resolution, the consumer wants the
 $14.99/month cable plan she was originally promised. ***CTR367-phone***"
399,"I was billed for a service call which I was told there would be no charge for. I rent a modem from
 Comcast and it was faulty so they came out to replace it and charged me for doing so plus an
 additional fee to set it up. After I complained multiple times they agreed charges were invalid because
 I shouldnt have to pay for faulty equipment and removed them from my account only to charge them
 again. they will not allow me to speak to a manager and shut off my service because I didnt pay the
 extra charges. I had to pay to restart my service. They also say that I signed a work order which I did
 not, but will not provide evidence of this order."
400,"We moved to Chicago in May 2014. We signed a two year contract with Comcast. When we
 switched apartments within the same building, we were told that if we wanted to keep the shows on
 our DVR, we would have to have a service technician come to install the new service. The service
 technician screwed up and we did not get to keep our shows. Comcast made up for this issue with a
 credit after several phone calls. Then, we realized that the old email account we used with the prior
 apartment was not transferred to our new address. I called and it was supposed to be switched.
 When I finally got word that it was, there were no emails. They were all gone. Now, I have to wait
 another 24 hours in hopes that they recover my VERY IMPORTANT emails. In addition, the speed is
 so SLOW. It is faster for us to use our cell service than to use the internet. And they say we have the
 ""Blast"" which is supposed to be very fast. I have never had more problems with a company in all my
 life. How is a company with terrible service and customer service still in business? Oh, because they
 pretty much have a monopoly."
401,"I started a 25mbps internet plan with Comcast Xfinity two months ago, and at the time, I wasn't
 notified that they would throttle my speeds based on my modem. I talked to the rep extensively, and
 this was never mentioned. This is also a modem I've used previously with Comcast and has delivered
 the speeds advertised.
 Flash forward, after two months of DL speeds at 15mbps, I chatted customer service to ask why it
 was so slow. They said that it's because of my DOCSIS 2.0 modem. This particular modem is rated
 up to 38mbps, much more than the 25mbps speeds I'm paying for.
 If this is the case, why doesn't Comcast Xfinity tell consumers before they sign up for a plan?
 Additionally, why can't they deliver speeds they advertise to modems that are more than capable of
 getting that speed?"
402,"HBO GO is not accessible on my Playstation devices because of the service provider ""Comcast"" is
 blocking my access to the service. If I had a Microsoft XBOX device, I would be able to access it
 there but I do not want a Microsoft product. I subscribe to the HBO service through Comcast but
 Comcast is not allowing me to use the service on the PlayStation device even though there is the
 HBO Go app available. Other service providers allow access like AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable,
 DirecTV and many others. I believe Comcast is block access to the HBO Go service that I pay for on
 the device I use most frequently."
403,"I called into Comcast to troubleshoot my Wifi connection, I was on the phone with 2 separate
 technicians for an hour. Nothing was able to be resolved and I asked for an escalation ticket to be put
 in as the matter was an emergency because I work from home. The tech and his supervisor proceed
 to put in an escalation ticket. They let me know that someone would be calling with an hour with a
 time frame for when I could expect a technician. I never received a phone call from either Comcast
 tech support or a field tech. I processed to call Comcast back 2 more times for an ETA and no one
 was able to give me any information besides that the tech would call me as soon as they were
 available. At the end of the day, NO ONE came out and I was stuck losing a day of work and pay.
 There still has been no follow up on this open escalation ticket."
404,"On Monday, May 18, 2015, I contacted Comcast customer service and asked to schedule a transfer
 of phone and internet services to a new address, to take effect on June 13th. Simply scheduling the
 transfer took more than two hours. I was disconnect twice, and during my third call, a Comcast
 representative, named Elizabeth Kilpatrick, stated that I could not transfer services unless I added
 cable television services to my account. When I indicated that I did not want cable television
 services, she directed that I could simply use it if my satellite services were unavailable, but that it
 was a necessary portion of the bundle.
 Apparently, Ms. Kilpatrick improperly entered the transfer order. As a result, my phone and internet
 services were immediately disconnected. On Tuesday, May 19, 2015, I spent more than five hours
 on the phone with Comcast customer service trying to resolve the problem. I spoke to more than a
 dozen representatives in at least the following departments: customer service, technical support,
 billing, customer solutions, activations, transfers, and ""resolutions."" I was disconnected at least five
 times and had to restart the entire process multiple times. After more than five hours on the phone, at
 9:30 PM, I was told that nothing could be done to restore service as the necessary departments were
 closed. Services were not restored.
 On Wednesday, May 20, 2015, I again spent more than five hours attempting to restore service.
 After being disconnected another half dozen times, I was directed by a Customer Solutions
 representative to hang up, leave work, and travel to the nearest Comcast Customer Service Center -
 nearly 10 miles away - because only the local branch could resolve the problem (despite the fact the
 problem was created at a national call center). Upon arriving at the Customer Service Center, I was
 instructed that they did not have the tools to restore my service at that location. After nearly three
 hours at that location, I was asked to leave as the Center was closing. Services were not restored. I
 was also informed that my telephone number had re-entered the pool of available numbers, as it was
 no longer provisioned to my account, and could be reassigned to another customer. I was unable to
 port my number to another provider.
 On Thursday, May 21, 2015, after more calls, more disconnections, being on hold for hours again,
 services were finally restored.
 On Friday, May 22, 2015, I called Comcast and was instructed that no transfer was scheduled on
 either of the two accounts that I now had with the company - the original or the new one that had to
 be created to restore service. Moreover, no transfer could be scheduled until I paid the $220+ bill on
 my account. As an aside, I am (or was) enrolled in Comcast's automatic payments system, which
 automatically deducts payments from my account. The $220 bill also included $80 or so of ""past due""
 charges. When I inquired as to the source of these charges, I was told that $80 came from my ""old""
 (now closed) account, and it was past due because the account had been closed. No payment had
 been due on my account when I originally called on May 18, 2015. The remaining $140 was
 apparently for ""installation"" and ""activation"" of my ""new"" account. In other words, Comcast has
 charged me over $200 to restore service that it improperly disconnected.
 As a telecommunications attorney, I bill my clients by the hour. The value of the time lost in trying to
 direct Comcast in how to remedy its own mistakes is more than $8,000. My wife, who is an
 independent pediatric speech language pathologist, had interruption to her business in an amount
 totaling more than $3,000. When all of the above was explained to Comcast representative, I was
 told that I would have to pay my bill before any of my complaints or problems could be further
 addressed. To date, there has been no resolution."
405,"I signed up for Comcast internet on April 30, 2015. I used my own modem and router, they said I
 could self install and would need to send a self install package with a cable card. They sent the
 package, no card, so I sent it back and they said they would send a cable box for inventory reasons. I
 received it, they tried to help me install via web chat, turns out they sent me an old broken box. i had
 to send that back too. I gave them the modem number, and they said they couldn't get a signal so
 they would need to send a technician . technician said everything was fine, and he said he didn't
 know why Comcast kept telling people they can self install because he needed to come out and apply
 Comcast cables outside. I continued to have internet outages everyday, I called them and they sent
 another tech out, he contradicted the first tech. also, when I called again, they said my account was
 changed from the internet plus package to the economy package, I didn't do this, they said it was
 fixed. over the course of the next 10 days, I called in when I saw my bill online, it was filled with
 charges including, 3 tech visits at $39.95(there were only 2 and supposed to be free), 2 package
 deliveries at $9.95(also their fault and supposed to be free) and so on. I was transferred, hung up on,
 and spoke and typed to so many agents to deal with the charges, when I also found out that they
 were charging me more for the deal I just signed up for online, and could not change it back being
 that it was ""unavailable"". I explained that I already signed up for it , it was still available online, and
 they kept saying that different places and groups have different deals, and they transferred me to
 everyone, hung up, promised calls back, and lied over and over. They said it was an online deal and
 had to be dealt with online. the online people, web chat people, said they couldn't do anything, only
 supervisors. I finally couldn't take it anymore and canceled. only then after yelling that I just want out
 and please cancel now, did they start to say, ok , maybe we can help you with that. I have never been
 treated to badly , or felt more sick to my stomache, or been more disgusted by a company in my life.
 all this and more was only less than 2 weeks into have their service. the day I finally said enough, I
 had no internet service for 10 hours. since I cancelled I keep getting calls from them about ""helping""
 me. this is the worst customer service, and worst form of fraud and false advertising I've ever
 encountered. These are some of the agents I dealt with, don't know if the names are actually
 real...Laquandria, manager Kendra Williams who promised a call that never came, Natasha, Javier
 Cavalir in Florida who also promised a call that never came and gave me a fake number to call for
 help, Linda Misky, Sharon, Pretty Aldrelyn(web chat name), Kyle, Chris, and many others. All rude,
 condescending, and liars. They completely and in the worst way take advantage of the fact that there
 are not that many internet options out there, but I would rather have nothing than ever deal with that
 disgusting excuse for a company again."
406,"I had ordered an Internet modem as part of my xfinity plan on Monday may 17th and the box was
 suppose to arrive Friday may 22nd as a self install unit. it did arrive on time but when I tried installing
 it myself i noticed the only way to install it was with a cable technician coming out to my apartment as
 there is no coax connection inside my apartment. I called customer service immediately to send a
 technician to my house. the first time I called I was on hold for 20 minutes until someone answered.
 once they answered they said they had set up an appointment for Monday may 25th at a time frame
 of 1-3pm. They sent an email with a link in case I wanted to reschedule. When I clicked on the link it
 took me to my account but it said I had no appointment scheduled for my account. it worried me so
 the next day Saturday may 23rd I called customer service again to tell them about my problem. one
 lady said she would redirect me to the correct line to fix my problem but all she did was hang up. I
 called back and was placed on hold for 25 minutes AGAIN so I decided to quit and call the next day. I
 called again sunday may 24th to customer service and explained to them my problem. the lady said
 there was still no appointment set up for my account. I was furious and asked if there was anything I
 can do or why I even got the email to reschedule an ""appointment"" I never even got. She finally set
 up an appointment for me but said the earliest appointment available would be fore Friday may 29th. I
 am beyond furious that I had been lied to about a technician coming to my house Monday and now I
 have to wait a whole other week after my package has arrived just for the service to be installed. My
 phone has ran out of data and I needed the wifi so my phone company would stop charging me for
 going over my data limit. I now have to wait a whole week for my internet to be installed after
 expecting it to be only one day. I haven't even started my business with Comcast as a customer and
 they're already showing poor customer service quality. I wish I could talk to a supervisor or higher
 manager to get my point across. I feel disrespected for being hung up on the second time I called and
 also for being lied about having an appointment that was actually never set up. I wish to talk to a
 higher manager or supervisor as I had cancelled plans on Monday may 25th to wait on a cable
 technician just to find out that appointment was never really made. If I can't get an appointment at a
 sooner time I might just have to cancel my account before it's even activated due to how they treat
 their customers. This is my first time purchasing cable from a company and its already going bad. I
 need answers as why I was lied to and hung up on."
407,"Today June 1, 2015 we had schedule installation for Internet service from Comcast. We had a window time frame of 10-12pm. Finally 11:33 I received a phone call from the comcast 800 number and a man on the phone says that the tech is outside my apartment and confirmed my address and I said great I'll be right down to let him in. I go outside and no one is there no tech no truck. Then my wife calls me from her job stating The Tech doesn't have the equipment to install our Internet. Then I told her that i just got a call from the 800 number about tech being at our apartment and while im still outside no one is there! Now more then 10 minutes later i receive another phone call from 800 number stating that the tech left because no one was home! I was outside the whole time no one ever showed up. We our first time customers. When we called to customer service nobody even cared we were called liars!

408,"I've had a problem with Comcast and their service for quite some time now. When I had service with them my internet never really worked. My Wi-Fi never really worked. My connection was always going out but I stayed with them considering I didn't have time to stay on the phone with them everyday due to the fact that I have a job. They ended up disconnecting my service due to my bill. When I called to take care of the situation no one was able to help, literally no one wanted to pickup the phone. I stayed on hold for about 20 minutes every time I called. I called 3 times. They encourage you to go online to take care of bills so eventually that's what I did. On May 31, 2015 I paid $59.94 towards my account via the internet, by the way not using their Wi-Fi. My online bill stated that I needed to pay that amount and the rest was due my the middle of June. I call back Tuesday the 2nd of June to find out that my services have been totally disconnected therefore I no longer have an account with them. When I called, that's when I finally get a person to talk to and he states, you have to pay an additional $61 to restore my services. I informed him that's not what it said online. He completely disregarded that and continued to tell me I needed to pay $61. A company that encourages you to pay online, you'd think all info would be correct. They lied and completely fabricated the truth entirely. I paid the amount that was asked but they still insist, no that's not all. My services are still out. I'm out of $60 from them and they still don't help me. Poor internet service, poor customer service, poor company completely! Please help!!!

409,"I made the mistake and got Comcast internet almost two months ago. First it took almost two weeks due to them having another tenant listed in my apartment#1. Then I had to keep calling kept getting the run around. Then finally when it was alledgedly straighten out. The CSR told me that the $60.00 charge for installation/tech would be waived and that she could not do it that day due to the ""billing"" process which was another lie. I called back the next day after installation to make sure the account was updated and was told that ""oh yes, dont worry about it it will automatically be updated. Of course that wasn't done. Service was interrupted on 5/30/2015 and I spent over 3 hours calling the 800#, talking with billing and them telling me there wasn't anything that they could do. Then I tried dialing local comcast and they didn't know what to do. I asked several times to speak to a Supervisor last Saturday and was denied and switched back into the que to start all over again. My bill is suppose to be $29.99 plus tax per month. Not the first bill of 95.00 Comcast has lied over and over including expecting me to talk to the tenant and go into the local office when the technician who installed service for the other knew they were not in my apartment # and he should have called it in to verify it and CHANGE THE APT#. It has been nothing but HELL since the first conversation. Why would anyone agree to a$60.00 charge to hook up internet when you can clearly do it yourself. It's not hard. I even said no to the charge and it was suppose to have been waived because it took comcast over a week to supply the service and now the one person that I did speak to on June 1st, is stating a ""play on the words"" that the csr entered when she put the service order in. GO BACK AND LOOK UP MY ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO YOUR QA CALLS. See how many times I called in the beginning and how many times I called on 5/29 and 5/30/2015. This is ridiculous. I'm going to keep calling someone in the State of Illinois including a BBB complaint until it is resolved. Denying me a Supervisor. Waiting for 3-45 mn per call for someone to answer not including the csr who have me a 800# that isn't even associated with Comcast. Then because I didn't have the bill with the account # on it and my mother was on the phone trying to help me the csr stated she could not look it up by telephone# or last four of ssn which is an outright lie. Comcast hooked service up in the basement of someone who gave their apartment# as #1 instead of basement. The tech rang my bell in 12/2014 when he came out stating that he had an order for apartment#1. I said no he didn't but he apparently installed it anyway knowing these people did not live in apt#1. But, sent me through hell stating that they took my slot in the two flat building. This held my service up for over 10 days. No apology or anything. Then you want to add $60.00 for a tech. No way. I didnt even know that Comcast mailed the equipment until my 20th phone call. Comcast is training its employees to make the sale by saying whatever is necessary. Then when you try to call back with questions or try to resolve any problems you get treated like crap. Since more than one person exhibited this behavior it must be common place. LISTEN TO YOUR CALLS! LOOK UP THE ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO THE CALLS.

414,"I called them to price internet service. Was told $115 per month plus $9.95 shipping (This includes my former basic cable usage). After spending three hours to connect (Because of modem issues) I receive a bill and it is for $133 a month. They overlooked including other fees and taxes. I would not have changed from ATT for no difference in price as I thought I was saving about $20 per month. Classic bait and switch tactics knowing it is a pain to switch companies and reconnect everything. I feel they should be fined heavily when what they quote you turns out to be grossly (And I believe intentionally) under actual cost. They state they record these conversations I feel they should provide recorded conversation to verify what I am stating. I called their office and receive the normal ""Well the representative erred and should have included all costs in his quote""

415,"We opened our account with Comcast mid- May of 2015. Since then we have had no Internet service. This is despite 5 appointments in which Comcast technicians came to our apartment. None of the technicians have provided us with service and claim that another appointment is required to fix the issue, which is always changing and never resolved. Additionally, on three separate occasions we waited for a scheduled appointment for 2 hours before learning the technician was not coming. First, the claim was that their system accidentally deleted the appointment. The second time the person writing the ticket wrote our phone number incorrectly and the tech never called the number on the account. The third time a supervisor promised an escalated appointment time and the technician never called to confirm. Today another technician came out and claimed we needed new wiring however it had been replaced by a team of three technicians the previous appointment. We are being charged for non existent services and Comcast doesn't seem to be interested in rectifying the problem.

416,"Frequent outages and billing issues. I've called Comcast at least 7 times now, trying to get my account right after moving, and I'm still being charged incorrectly. Plus, we have frequent outages. Apparently service is out for the next 45 min. based upon the last call to Comcast. This is unacceptable. I'm using my cellular data plan currently, but I still get charged by Comcast, even when they can't provide reliable service. Please investigate. This is a common occurrence with this company.

419,"Hi,
 I have a small business at 4001 W Devon Ave, ste 340, CHicago, IL 60646. Comcast is the ""ONLY"" internet provider in this building. Even AT&T does not have any internet connections here. Due to this, Comcast charges excessive amount of $70+other charges for a basic internet service. Also, the force to have a 2 year contract to get this price.
 I am stuck since there is no other option and Comcast has complete monopoly in this context. Similar internet for personal use is sold for just $30 but Comcast is inflating the prices to take advantage of this monopoly in this region.

 Request #353451 ""Monopoly of Comcast and price es..."" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #353451:
 I am at 4001 W Devon Ave, Chicago, IL 60646. Comcast is the only provider in the building. Their basic internet has been priced at 70 dollars and they insist that they will not give me xfinity product because building is a business address. The basic internet has other fees like $200 of installation fee unless you sign for 2-3 years of contract (even when you supply your own equipment). I received a call from Comcast that suggested that they charge $70 for basic internet everywhere but that is not true. In residential buildings where there are other options, comcast sells similar services for 24.99. Comcast told me that there is a data cap in 24.99 service. I asked them to sell me that same service with data cap to me ( I am not against data cap) but they will not.
 Comcast is exploiting this monopoly and taking advantage of people like me. I need FCC to intervene and ensure that ordinary citizens should have reasonable access to internet as reasonable cost.

421,"I just want fast internet, and Comcast is the only provider to offer the speeds I need. They gave me a ""promotional"" deal for the first year, but then refused to honor it for the second year. The only way I could get the speeds without switching carriers was to pay an extra $30 and upgrade to a ""Basic Cable"" bundle(which I do not want), which only includes non-HD versions of the channels I already receive OTA. Additionally, they have encrypted these basic cable channels, requiring me to lease an ""HD"" box, instead of being able to use my TV's built in tuner. I was then sent a box and charged a ""Self-Install fee"" even I explicitly told them not to (I was told that a supervisor would call me back to record my complaint - its 35 days later, and Im still waiting)

422,"Price gouging monopoly. I can not get RCN to my building , ATTs not even broadband so thats not an option. It leaves me with one company who charges 120 dollars for shit service. 50mb down and 10mbps thats megabit not megabyte. I wish megabyte, why invest in infrastructure that doesnt keep consumers happy. I am currently in Ireland right now, in rural Ireland and can get 80mbps down for 49.99/month. Fucking trumps our shit service. I live only 10 miles from downtown Chicago where there are huge nodes and server farms the monopoly comed for the fiber lines to be UNUSED. They lobby so we can not open our own municipal internet they have lobbied so hard i wouldn't be surprised if he pandered the FCC after his shitty run as a mayor.
 NO MORE bullshit promos where the rates double after 6 months.
 NO more price gouging on rental fees, taxes are acceptable if they actually went to infrastructure.
 DO NOT propose a data cap, i have 4 IT professionals living in my house and we push 1TB monthly. we are in a 1st world country data consumption is not the problem, or on mobile cheap fucks.
 Let local coop government set up their own fiber, because they wont do it.
 Stop lobbying comed to keep their fiber lines unused since the 90s.
 FIX THIS MONOPOLY IN CHICAGO, Competition sparks innovation we are using a infrasturcture not upgraded since the 1980s our entire infrastructure is falling apart. Fucking garbage.

423,"I was basically harassed with calls for weeks from Comcast every day asking me if I wanted to upgrade form basic internet to a faster internet with HBO and Basic cable. I said no every time until I finally couldn't take it any more and as it was only $10 more every month I just did it. HOWEVER. The only reason i did was because they strictly told me I could cancel and go back to my ORIGINAL deal if I didn't want it within 30 days. Somewhere within that timeframe, I called and cancelled because I dont even watch TV. I was told my original deal wasn't available any longer and I would just end up paying more for internet alone if I took away the TV/HBO. I think that is absurd and I want to go back to our original payment and internet speed without HBO or TV.

424,"Comcast's primary business method seems to be committing the biggest bait and switch possible on the American Public. My story is not the only similar story, and in fact is rather mild on the Comcast Scale.
 When I signed up for my current internet service with Comcast, I like many others was offered a lower promotional rate. The Comcast representative told me that when my rate goes up after the promo discount, to call customer service and there would be an option to reclaim that promotional rate, or something similar. I called customer service soon after setting up my internet service, and was guaranteed the same thing by a second representative.
 When my rate increased, my call to customer service was frustrating to say the least. On several occasions, I was told that lowering the rate after the promotional deal expired is not something the company does, nor do they even have a lower rate than what I was paying. Which is patently false, as my billing statement from the month previous was near 50% lower than the new ""standard"" rate. I was then told I had the lowest possible price, and offered several other packages, all which were significantly more expensive as an alternative. I was also not told about their broadband-only packages as required after the purchase of NBCUniversal.

426,"On June 24, 2015, I contracted with Comcast Xfinity internet for a $19.99 a month package for 3 mbps. I have experienced interruptions and problems to the service. After speaking with Comcast on the phone to explain my issues, they recommended I upgrade my internet speed package for $49.99 a month with 25 mbps internet speed. I purchased this package in hopes my internet speed would increase. However, my internet speed has not. Please see the enclosed pictures as proof. As I have not received the service I contracted for I consider Comcast in a breach of contract. I expect them to rectify this breach of contract and provide the services I paid for. I request a reimbursement of $138.18 which represents the proportion of the sum I have paid for the service that I have not received.

427,"I enabled automatic payments on my Comcast account on 7/17/2014. I was comfortable enabling automatic payments as my previous bills had consistently been the same amount. That changed a couple billing cycles later.
 From November 2014 to March 2015, Comcast charged me a DOCSIS 3 Modem lease fee for the cable modem that I own. After multiple phone calls and much confusion from Comcast customer service representatives, the charges have stopped and my account will be credited. The first charge was $8.00, the four subsequent cycles were $10.00.
 I still feel the need to file a complaint regarding their negligent business practices. There were no changes made to my account prior to the charges appearing. I should not have to inspect my bill each month for erroneous charges - Comcast should have a system in place to prevent this sort of thing.
 I have attached my billing statements for the last 15 months as proof.

428,"My primary complaint is that Comcast/Xfinity has manipulated there service delivery to me during my moving process. I prepared by calling Comcast ahead of time to transfer my service address. I did this because my wife and I work from home and require internet. I was approved for a ""self-install"" (plug in my own equipment and be good to go). After 5 days I found out from the Comcast technician that my building was not wired for comcast service. Comcast manipulated their service area in order to keep my business even though they knew that my building was not wired for service. I lost 4-days of work and had to call off work due there manipulation. No apology or compensation has been issued at this time. Below is the timeline of events
 - On 7/16/15, I filed for my service to be stopped on 7/20/15 and transferred to my new address on 7/21/15. I was then approved for a ""self install"" on 7/21.
 - My tv/internet/phone was turned off on 7/18/15. I called Comcast on 7/18/15 and I was told that our service could not be turned back on because we were moving. After a hour on the phone I was told that our service will be turned back on in 24 hours. It was not turned back on. I called on 7/19/15 but I was told the same thing that I was told the previous day.
 - On 7/21/15 I attempted to ""self install"" my equipment with no success. I called tech support but was told that I needed to call the ""sales department because my account was terminated."" When I called back on 7/22/15 I was told that my account has been re-activated and it will take 1-5 hours for the system to turn my equipment back on.
 - On 7/23/15 I called back when my service still was not working, customer support stated that that they will have to send a technician to my apartment to turn on my service. The appointment was for 7/24/15 between 10:00am-Noon.
 - No technician arrived on 7/24/15, I called and I was told that my appointment was rescheduled for 7/25/15 for 10:00am-noon. I was not notified of the appointment change.
 - When the technician arrived I was told that the building was not wired for comcast and he had to ""wire the building."" I had full service on 7/25/15.

429,"I signed up for a 50mbps plan from comcast/xfinity. I self-installed a my own modem, and for the first day or so it worked great. Then my speed dropped like a rock. I've had three technicians come out to determine the problem, and every technician has disagreed on the cause. The first said my line was bad. The second said the building's cable box is to blame. The third said the cable box was fine, and my modem must be the problem. I got a new modem, and it couldn't even hold a stable signal. Now its been over a month and I still don't have a reliable connection. I was even in contact with a technician supervisor, and made plans to leave work early so he could fix the issue, only to have him ignore my calls. I've reached out to @comcastcares, but they've been unresponsive. This is beyond unprofessional, and i wont stand for it.

 Spoke with Comcast. Did not address issues about billing outside of saying that certain promotions had ended which still didn't explain small charges in original complaint. Also stated that a late fee was due for missing billing by 3 days. Acct is always in good standing. Amount stated that I owed in late fee was also different than the printed late fee in the bill.

431,"The only ISP that offers reasonable speeds in my area (Comcast) refuses to give me the price offered on their website when I have the same package listed, except with even fewer features. When I call Comcast's Customer Service department, the representatives constantly dodge my issue, offering to lower my speed by a factor of 3 and subtracting $10 from my overall bill. Also, every time I call and believe the issue is resolved, the actual bill I receive is completely different from what I was told.
 All I want is to be offered the package that is offered on their own website.

 At the moment, there is an offer on their website for $49.99 a month for the ""Internet Plus with Blast!"" package for 75mbps down. My current bill forces me to pay for $70 for this package! I would gladly switch to a different provider, but Comcast is the only ISP that provides ""broadband"" service as defined by the FCC.

432,"The price I am paying for my cable internet is not comparable to the local telephone companies Fiber that unfortunately falls short of my residence. I am currently paying comcast for 50Mbps and only getting about 16Mbps on a good day. I have been told it has something to do with my end of the line.
 If it has to do with my side of the line then I have to pay for a tech to come out and tell me everything is in fact good on my side.... I can't stand that this big company can force me to pay for an issue that is not in any way cause by me. The rates are outrageous and customer service is just as poor.
 The United States Navy hunts pirates but some how we still are dealing with Comcast. If I don't find justice from this end I guess my next step is to file a complaint with General James Mattis to seek retribution. Thank you in advance for your time!

433,"I have been an Xfinity customer for over 3 years. I pay them over $60 a month for just internet service. When I initially signed up with them over three years ago, their sales representative checked my service area and promised me download speeds of 25mbs and upload speeds of 6-8mbs. They also sold me on renting the modem from them and buying the router from them as well which I did since they described the modem and router as best in the market. When their installer guy came out to my house, he wanted to drill holes all over the walls to install which I had to help him figure out a way to minimize the drilling. I then asked him about the modem and router being installed. He said the modem is an okay brand but he has never heard of the router brand. I was already at a point where I said just install the equipment so I can get going. My router crashed within 5 days of use and would not give out any connection. After 3 days of calling Xfinity customer service, getting the run-around, being transferred to 4 different departments, being hung up on 3 times and them telling me ""Well the sales department will try to sell you on anything they can and there is nothing we can do"", I figured I will just take my loss and go buy a new router which I did. I bought a decent router for about $80. Ever since I have had the modem, my speeds have been at almost dial up level. I have tested my modem speed and it shows I get about 4 MBS download and less than 1 MBS upload. I contacted Xfinity numerous times about it and all they did was have me restart my modem and unplug my modem over and over again. I finally asked them if they can ship me a new or updated modem. I spoke with the representative on 4/13/2015 but did not get his name. He processed my order and confirmed I will receive my order in 3-5 days maximum. I did not receive my modem in that time period so I called Xfinity again on 4/22/15 and spoke with Denise in customer service department. She confirmed with me that my order was processed and is on its way and that I should see it arrive in about 3 days. I still did not receive anything from Xfinity. In the meantime, I am paying them for service and I have almost zero connection 5 out of the 7 days of the week. So I contacted Xfinity again today 4/29/15 and spoke with David who advised me that my order was cancelled. I asked who cancelled it, he said he did not know, I said what might have caused it to be cancelled, David did not know that either. I asked for the representative’s name that processed my order initially, David said there was no name, just a note that showed the order being processed. At this point I was beside myself and decided to file this complaint as it has been almost 3 weeks since I have placed my order for my product and still have nothing. David had to re-process my order and at this point I will have to wait another 5 days for my order to arrive (assuming it does not get cancelled again). In the meantime, they have continuously charged me my monthly rate for an outdated product that they sent me that does not even connect. Can someone please look into this as I feel I deserve to be compensated for my time and money I have paid them for all this time. Thank you for your consideration.

435,"I initially signed up for the Comcast Internet Plus Blast with 105 MBPS (listed as $49.99) in early April. I had never had Comcast before, and stupidly didn't listen to friends and family who warned me against them. Thinking that this was a good deal, I had called one of their representatives for my apartment complex to confirm that the promotion was still available and request installation for April 19, 2015.
 The technician showed up within the quoted time frame, and had no idea what promotion I was talking about. Due to a language difference, neither of us could figure out what the other was saying. We spent about 20 minutes getting nowhere until he assured me that I was getting what I requested. Aside from a SUPER slow MBPS speed of 20, everything on the video end seemed to be correct.
 I received my first bill a few weeks later. I immediately noticed that the package was listed incorrectly on my bill as ""Internet Blast Plus 25."" I was still getting internet speeds much lower than I was paying for and had been charged for a package over $60 and discounted to reach the $50 range. I was double charged a $37.50 instillation fee (I was quoted $35) and charged $10 for an HD box that I did not request and was not informed of.
 I proceeded to play phone tag with my ""representative"" for nearly two weeks. After being promised that the issue would be fixed and seeing no results, I contacted Comcast's customer service department over the phone. I was told that they had never heard of this promotion before and that they would be unable to honor it for me, even though I had a screen shot on my phone and wanted to email them a copy. I was told to go to my nearest Comcast store for assistance.
 The next morning I did just that. I was told by the higher ups at the Roseville location that they would fix the package in the system and upgrade it on my account. They seemed very eager to help me and I was relieved that I finally had someone who appeared to care about my frustrations. They told me that they would estimate the updated charge and I could pay it then as a credit to my account, as they weren't able to see the updated amount due. I ended up paying $118 and was assured that I would see an update in speed when I got home. I did, but 45 MBPS is still much lower than the 105 I was promised.
 I was sick of dealing with the issue and was hoping that the speeds would get better in time. They never did. Fast forward a month to today. I received a new bill in the mail for $152.12. According to this bill, I had not paid $71.63 and was charged $10 in late fees along with the most current bill of $80.49. Needless to say I had not received anything from Comcast since my initial incorrect billing statement that I had thought to have resolved in the store. Part of this charge was a $17 charge for a ""Speed Increase,"" with a $7 ""Service Discount."" Seriously!? My package is still incorrect, I am still not
 getting the speeds I was originally promised, and now they are trying to charge me even more money.
 I immediately called customer service, again, to be told that I must have missed the bill in the mail. I informed the representative that I had never received it and requested that they drop the late fee if I paid the total amount immediately by credit card over the phone. He informed me that Comcast would not, and that they would also charge me $5 for paying over the phone. He told me that if I did not want to pay the $5 over the phone fee that I could again go to the Roseville store for assistance, but that they would not drop the late fee either. I was so frustrated that I hung up on him and paid the total bill online.
 I am so sick of Comcast. The do not deliver on their promotions and service speeds but are not afraid to charge you additional money wherever they can and without your consent. I am still not receiving the speeds I was promised, am still being charged for an HD box I did not want or request, was not sent a physical bill for last month's billing statement as I had requested, charged with a $10 late fee anyway, as well as a extra $10 ""Speed Increase"" charge. Their representatives are shady, unhelpful, and uncaring.

438,"I called Comcast on 3/30/2015 to get a higher Internet speed. I was put on hold and was disconnected. I called back and tried the call back feature. They called back and I missed the call so I started over. After much discussion I was told I could get a deal with TV and 2 movie channels and 25mbs Internet speed for close to $60 a month. So they changed the speed and I checked for the 2 movie channels and found none. I called back and asked for just 25mbs internet. Put on hold and disconnected. I feel they are evading and misleading costumers. There are a lot of complaints on line about this type of strategy of frustrating customers until they just give up and keep their poor service. I called back again and finally got information on 25mbs internet only for $44 a month for 1 year . I kept asking to verify this price and the agent kept saying this was the correct price and I would get an email stating the details. The email stated it would be $75 a month. I called back and asked for a supervisor. I was told the $75 was what I would be charged for 25mbs internet and no tv. I was lied to and manipulated into getting something I didnt ask for. I see in forums this is what Comcast does to get clients into higher priced packages. It is fraud, lies and corruption. Actually it is a corrupt business of racketeering across state lines that is covered under the RICO act.

445,"1. On April 24, 2015 I called Comcast to inform them that we were moving to a new location and asked to have our services transferred there. Our current contract at our old home was a bundled package for $109/month.
 2. We were told that our bill would increase to $159/month for the bundled package because the promotion could not be transferred to our new address that is located approximately 7 miles away.
 3. We asked Comcast to cancel the service because we were unwilling to pay the additional $50 for the same service
 4. A service rep named Lawrence then told us that we could transfer the promotional cost of the service to the new address. He noted that he would have the billing reflect that we would pay $109 for the bundled services by April 27, 2015.
 5. When we received our first bill from Comcast at the new address, we were charged $159 for the bundled service.
 6. We called Comcast on June 16 2015 and were told during that phone call that the bill would be adjusted to reflect that we would pay $109 for the bundled service. When we paid our bill on June 20, 2015 it was reduced by over $100, which I assumed was the adjusted bill.
 7. I received a new bill on June 25, 2015 that itemized the bundled package costing $159. When I called Comcast re why this package is not the agreed upon $109/month, the service rep told me that she is not sure why anyone would tell me they could reduce the cost of the bundled package because the promotional costs do not transfer to new addresses. She also told me I had 30 days to change my mind about the service and since I did not cancel the service in 30 days, we are responsible for paying the $159 for the bundled.
 8. We would like Comcast to honor their agreement to us that we would be charged $109/month for the bundled package and have that rate reflected on each subsequent bill. We would also like Comcast to reimburse us for a total of $100 that represents the additional $50 that we paid on our bill for the May 2015 and June 2015 bill. If Comcast refuses to honor their agreement with us, we would like to terminate our services with Comcast without a termination fee since they did not honor their agreement with us.

When I called Comcast re why this package is not the agreed upon $109/month, the service rep told me that she is not sure why anyone would tell me they could reduce the cost of the bundled package because the promotional costs do not transfer to new addresses. She also told me I had 30 days to change my mind about the service and since I did not cancel the service in 30 days, we are responsible for paying the $159 for the bundled.
 8. We would like Comcast to honor their agreement to us that we would be charged $109/month for the bundled package and have that rate reflected on each subsequent bill. We would also like Comcast to reimburse us for a total of $100 that represents the additional $50 that we paid on our bill for the May 2015 and June 2015 bill. If Comcast refuses to honor their agreement with us, we would like to terminate our services with Comcast without a termination fee since they did not honor their agreement with us.

446,"My Comcast modem stopped working on 5/9/2015, I purchased a new modem because I was unable
 to get to comcast during their working hours, Internet would still not work. A Technician came to the
 house on 5/10/2015. I was never advised that there would be a charge and I did not anticipate a
 charge since it was a malfunction of the modem provided by Comcast. I was then sent a new modem
 by Comcast that I did not authorize, I was charged $9.95 for the modem, which I did not need and a
 $10 monthly fee. I had to take the modem to the UPS center in my town to return to get this charge
 removed. After I spoke with a rep on 5/26 and told her I was unhappy with this and would be looking
 at other providers, she disconnected my Internet that I am still paying for. I had to make several calls
 back to Comcast to get my Internet turned back on!"
447,"In December of 2013, I moved to Florida to complete my education. The apartment where I was renting recommended Comcast/Xfinity for my internet, cable and security alarm needs. The comcast salesperson , Mr. Richard Feliciano asked me to sign a 2 year contract to which I protested as I knew I was only going to live in Florida for a year to 15 months. Mr Feliciano told me not to worry as in the event I move, they can transfer the services to my new address. He said Comcast/xfinity is a,""nationwide"" company and there should be no problem. In January 2015, I informed them I was moving to Closter, New Jersey. I was flabbergasted to find out they don't provide services to my current address. I wanted to continue with their services but they couldn't provide it. They penalized me an early termination fee of $ 700.00 when it was Comcast who could not fulfill their part of the contract. While it's true that the guarantee of moving the service is not written, you can anonymously call any comcast office and I guarantee you that you will receive the same verbal assurance/lie that they can move the service nayionwide. Please stop Comcast from victimizing the public with their aggressive sales pitch and lies.

449,"See complaint #126096. My email changed in and around Feb. 11th 2015. So my has changed to I had complained originally about keeping my email address that I had with comcast before I changed to ATT uverse on 2/10/15. I called comcast the day after my services were installed by AT@T as I was advised. I did speak to a Kit in the corporate office. That said she never got any email address complaint issue from FCC. She said they had no record of my cancelling my service on training notes they had made. But my experience with Comcast is in Sept. 2014 and thru October 2014 when I transfered service to the location I live at now . They didn't get half the messages I left. I had to go to other Departments within Comcast. So it didn't surprise me they had no training record. They don't tell you that you may be taped for training purposes. I started Uverse service on 2/10/15. I have copies of all 3 service with AT@T internet, tv and phone. I live on social security I wouldn't have kept both going. I did ask what my last bill would be when I called in Feb. Told about 103.00 plus 20.00 from my old bill. I also discussed they would be getting a complaint from FCC as well as AT@T to try to keep my old email. Which the guy who signed me up with ATT. uverse promised. Kit was rude to me . Tried to trip me up I kept saying 2/10/15. She said she only saw a call on 3/10/15. She got me off track and kept referring to 3/10/15. Trying to put words in my mouth. They could of check my call record on my voice mail and to see services weren't being used. I did call Comcast again in March around 3/10/15 to find out why I was still be charged for all 3 triple play services. I spoke to customer service first who sent me to another department. That person said I was being charge for internet only. I attempted to dispute this but she wouldn't budge or address my issues. If you stay with comcast they aren't as rude but leave them and they don't care what the customer has to say. This has been a mess since the origiunal complaint with you in Feburary. As before in October 2014 Comcast workmen left open a electrical door that in 6 inches or so off the ground. We have kids in this complex and if it rains that wiring could short out. They were working on this box for another customer at the beginning of May or end of April 2015. I called to tell them about it. That box is still wide open. It needs a certain key to lock and close. As they did with this dangerous issue in October 2014 leaving it un fixed they are doing it again. But of Course they keep such good records. I blocked the door with a something I owned and 2 days later it was stolen. If it causes a fire or a young child or even a animal is hurt. They are liable.

450,"I bought an Xbox One in April of this year, 2015; Ever since, my internet connection has been boggled down. Before my purchase of the Xbox we had a download speed of 128Mbps with uploads of 10-12Mbps but the only items used on the network were 2 pcs, a laptop, 2 tablets, and 2 phones. But now that we have the Xbox, we all of a sudden drop from 128Mbps to anywhere from 25Mbps to 50Mbps if we are lucky to get even that but the upload speeds remain at 10-12Mbps. It's clear that we are being penalized for having an Xbox after years of service to the same company who has a monopoly on the entire surrounding area, and frankly a $200+ monthly bill should provide the service that I'm supposedly ""guaranteed"". The sooner Google can come to California the better because someone needs to send all these monopolizing companies a nice wake up call for terrible service, overpricing, and just the generalized screw the customer because they have no other options bull crap.

451,"On May 22 after two weeks of intermittent service, Tech Service Call revealed house needed
 Comcast to rewire. Made appointment for Tuesday, May 26, 2015 for 10 am to 12 pm. Received
 confirmation email on May 25 at 7:19 AM (time stamp attached and second file has appt info). At
 10:49 AM while on PHONE BUSINESS CONVERSATION THAT I COULD NOT INTERRUPT, I
 received a voice message (attached file). When my PHONE CALL was complete at 11:29 AM, I
 listened to the voice message which was from Comcast saying ""We are sorry we missed you."" THEY
 HADN'T MISSED ME. I WAS ON THE PHONE!!!!!!! What if I had been in the BATHROOM!!! I called
 Comcast, waited 8 minutes on hold and informed the REP that I was at the HOUSE WAITING and
 the REP TOLD ME YOU'RE SCHEDULED for between 10-12 PM. There will be someone there. I
 asked, ""ARE YOUR SURE?"" The Rep answered, ""Yes, your status is OPEN. Someone will be at
 your house between 10-12."" WHEN NO ONE was at my house by 12, I called Comcast at 12:29
 and was TOLD, the other REP didn't LOOK FAR ENOUGH, YOUR STATUS IS CLOSED!!!! I asked
 for a TECH TO BE SENT as I AM STILL SITTING HERE WAITING. At 1:50 PM, I was told that
 someone would call me BACK within 1/2 hour to TELL ME IF A TECH COULD MAKE IT TODAY.
 REALLY???? ANOTHER wasted hour of time. At 1:16 PM, I received a CALL FROM COMCAST.
 ""Unfortunately, no one can come to your house today. There are no techs available in your area.""
 THIS IS Comcast's POLICY: IF for ANY REASON YOU CANNOT REACH YOUR PHONE WHEN
 COMCAST CALLS AFTER COMCAST HAS ALREADY SENT A CONFIRMATION EMAIL, whether
 you're on the toilet or your child has an emergency and you can't get to the phone to answer , YOU
 LOSE YOUR APPT, YOUR CASE IS CLOSED, EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE WAITING IN YOUR
 HOME AT THE SCHEDULED AND APPOINTED TIME AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CALL AND TELL
 COMCAST YOU ARE IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU COULDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE.
 So WHEN COMCAST CALLS YOUR PHONE and you use a walker and can't get to the phone to
 answer it, YOUR SCHEDULED APPT IS CANCELLED--even if YOU CALL COMCAST AND TELL
 THE REP YOU'RE IN YOUR HOUSE. WAITING!!!!
 Why do I care? Because tomorrow FPL is turning the electric off in my house so that I can have NEW
 ELECTRIC PANEL WIRING. AND NOW, I DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE TIME THE REST OF THE
 WEEK--SO I AM WAITING FOR A SUPERVISOR to RETURN from LUNCH to CALL ME and
 EXPLAIN WHY THERE ARE NO TECHS AVAILABLE FOR MY APPT TODAY THAT COMCAST
 CANCELLED AND THEN MISREPRESENTED TO ME THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CANCELLED.
 But when I went onto Comcast to get my account number, MY APPT is STILL SCHEDULED at 2:02
 PM in the AFTERNOON! I have attached copy of that as well. Please look in the lower right hand

457,"Much like the complaints of other Comcast subscribers, they are the only broadband provider available at my address and their billing practices are forcing me into paying for services I am not interested in having.
 I have expressed an interest in removing cable, in fact, I never wanted it in the first place. After talking to two different representatives on the phone, a representative in the store, as well as checking at specials available online, there are no other price options with reliable internet speed other than the one I currently have.
 My bill is over $80 in order to have just 25 mbps of download speed. I've looked at all options to lower it, because $80 is just too much in my budget in order to do some of my work at home from time to time. If I wish to cancel the cable service (that I was coerced to bundle in), I've been informed my bill would actually INCREASE. Opting for a lower speed would save pennies but drop my internet speed DRAMATICALLY to a mere 3 mbps of download or 6 mbps of download speed.
 I shouldn't be forced to subscribe to a service I do not want in order to be able to afford a reasonable (but still VERY slow in the grand scheme) internet speed.

I contacted Verizon and they said Comcast had it shut down as I was switching over. So now we sit with no house phone, no internet, no upgraded TV and no security system.

462,"On March 12, 2015, I called Comcast to request cancellation of my home internet service. My year of promotional pricing for the 50 Mbps service was up and we were looking to reduce the cost of our broadband service. CenturyLink is offering us a 20 Mbps service for $29.95 for one year with a one year contract plus a $25 Visa prepaid card. The retention representative my wife and I spoke with said she would drop us to a 24 Mbps for $34.99 a month for one year after which we could attempt to re-negotiate for another deal or special. We accepted her offer because the broadband service from Comcast is stable and my wife works from home, so that is very important to us.
 I noticed a significant drop in speed after the conversation, but it wasn't until a few days later that I decided to visit speedtest.net to check the actual throughput speeds. I was very disappointed to see download speeds between six and seven Mbps and upload speeds around one Mbps.
 Shortly thereafter, I signed onto an online chat (transcript attached) with a Comcast billing rep who confirmed the plan we were downgraded to was actually a 6 Mbps plan for $34.99. I expressed my frustration and the rep transferred me to a chat with a product support specialist (I believe that was the department). This rep was not helpful at all and I told them I just wanted what I was promised, nothing more.
 During this chat, my internet service dropped and reconnected several times. As I stated earlier, our broadband is always extremely stable, so I can only assume this rep didn't want to deal with my issue and was cycling my connection on and off to get me to go away. I am sure this is unacceptable by any standard. I let the issue go until today because I hate dealing with this kind of run-around, but this needs to be resolved, so I called Comcast again. I spoke with a retention rep and told him about my issue and recounted my previous interactions with the Comcast reps. He stated that there is no 24 Mbps package and offered a 44 Mbps package for $44.95. I told him I only wanted what I was promised by the first retention rep and he said he couldn't do that. I asked to speak with a supervisor to lodge a complaint and he said he could submit it for me because he didn't want to raise his hand and wait for one of the few supervisors available today. He suggested I submit my concern via Comcast's customer feedback website. I thanked him for his help and have decided to file a complaint here.

463,"When I use my Apple TV on my Airport Extreme router, I can stream videos, mainly because of the
 encryption protecting the server identity. But when I reconnect to the Xfinity Arris router instead of the
 Apple Airport Router, the connection will freeze up almost like an endless buffer. no progress is made
 usually. This happens mainly on the Youtube and HBO apps, sometimes on Netflix. When I check my
 connection speed, It's fast enough to stream. I typically get around 15 mb/s on my phone, 20-25mb/s
 on my computer, and 8-10 on the Apple TV. I've found that I am not the only one with this issue. I've
 come to the conclusion that Comcast is throttling my internet based on the device"
464,"I called yesterday to cancel my service and Comcast wanted to charged me about $170 for early
 termination. This amount to about 2 months service. If I wasn't in the military I would be faced with
 this charge. I am complaining because this fee has nothing to do with the service considering that it
 is just a ""flick of a button"" to turn off (or on) a service."
465,"I had comcast internet installed in February on a plan for 105MBPS. I have never gotten more than 40 and average between 30-35, although it regularly drops below 25. I have had more than 7 techs out and was charged anywhere from $30-$100 despite being covered not only by my plan, but also by the default policy based on my install date. It took more than 15 times contacting comcast between chat and phone calls to have those charges fixed. I filed a complaint previously with the FCC and was contact by a rep named kathy, however the complaint was closed, I never received any written communication about it but she stopped responding to either my emails or calls completely once it was closed. I still do not know what the ""resolution"" of the complaint supposedly was. A supervisor from another department called me back after I requested a call and I was told my apartment had to be rewired; the first two appointments were cancelled by comcast without informing me. The third time one was supposedly scheduled, they instead charged me $70 for a failed self install tech that did not and could not handle rewires. Almost two weeks later, my apartment was rewired and despite at least 5 prior techs telling me my apartment had recently been rewired, the cables apparently were a minimum of 10 years old. Once the rewire was done, my internet was performing at the same speeds. I was contacted by customer relations again (they had setup the rewire) and was told that my bill would be credited and a supervisor from maintenance would contact me within 24 hours. Almost a week later I got a call from someone stating they worked for Comcast, however they were laughing throughout the message they left me and I could not understand much of anything he said. I called the number back 4 times and left messages but never got a call back. I called the person I spoke to in customer relations again to explain the situation and asked that he call me back, or contact whoever was supposed to contact me again to get the problem resolved. That call was 4 days ago and I still have not heard from him or anyone else. It was nearly two weeks ago that he said someone would call within 24 hours. I just ran these speed tests (on ethernet) after running a complete scan and clean up on my PC: http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4427333671

 It has been over four months since I originally reported this issue to comcast, and there has been absolutely no improvement, horrible communication, billing errors, work order errors, tech errors etc. They have not lowered my monthly rate despite the fact that I am not getting even the minimum speed of 50MBPS they have told me I should have, although I should almost always be closer to the 105 on ethernet and continue to make promises that they do not fulfill.

 This request was closed and merged into request #176984 ""Horrible Service and Support""."
466,"While I know it's common for the price to increase after the first year of service, I was given no warning before my bill suddenly increased by 50%. If I was notified beforehand, even just by email, that my service was about to become more expensive I would have had ample time to switch providers. Instead I'm stuck with a bill that's 50% higher than what I used to pay.
 A 50% increase is quite significant and I think it warrants a warning. I'm not sure if it's common practice to ignore your customers and let them be surprised by a large bill after the promotional period is over, but it shouldn't be.

467,"My name is. My husband and I recently had to check online for our Comcast bill because we never received one in the mail, and when we got on the website, we had a $167.85 bill.. But when I click on bill description it only says $58 we were only two days late on the bill and no where on the bill did it say we had a late fee. No one has called or mailed us anything to let us know we were late. We always have our bill mailed except for this month.

468,"Recently we relocated service from one Comcast installation to another location. First, they *required* that I have one of their techs come out to do the 'install' even though it consisted of just plugging the same equipment into the new location.
 I already had everything hooked up and working days before the tech came out, and when I called in I was told it was still required for a tech to come out and for us to pay a $50 fee.
 Prior to the transfer, we would pay Comcast for the month's actual use. So at the end of May we were paying our May bill.
 On transferring, Comcasat decided to change the billing date to the middle of the month. Rather than charging a pro-rated amount for the partial month, Comcast charged us for the full month but said payment was due mid-month.
 When I called to correct the billing dates, the indivdiual I spoke to on the phone said that it was explicitly written in our transfer order that the billing dates were going to change.
 No such language exists in the transfer documentation, and when I asked him to explain *where* in the documentation it said that, the rep was unable to. The billing department was unable to. No one was able to explain why we were being charged for 8 weeks of service in a 6 week span, other than to say ""it's normal for us to bill in advance.""
 Nothing in any of the actual documentation provided to us said anything of the sort, and if I had any other alternative I would take it.

469,"On June 10th, I called Comcast at 800-934-6489 to transfer my services to a new address. I told the agent I wanted to keep everything (cable and internet) the same as my previous address minus a cable box. The agent offered me a special for cable, Internet, phone, and home security; I told him I don’t want the offer if it comes at an extra cost to my bill. He mentioned this would be saving me $100 from what I currently pay (average of $220 a month). He told me my account was up to date and the balance was at $0; I agreed to the new package. He offered me $100 gift card for being loyal and transferring my services. I thanked him for taking care of me and for being so pleasant. We scheduled an appointment for June 11th. On that same date, the services at my previous address were disconnected.
 On the 11th, the Comcast technician came to install but was unsuccessful. I didn’t understand because this address (my mother’s home) previously had Comcast as a provider. He stated the wires outside were cut and he needed to put in a work order for it to be repaired that can take 7-10 business days. I didn’t grab a name but his contact number is 443-510-7761. I called Comcast to see if I could receive an earlier date (my husband takes online classes) but was unable to get anything sooner. Out of frustration, I cancelled the account. My husband said he could make other accommodations and asked to call Comcast and restore our services.
 On the 15th, I called to restore the service. I spent a 1h13m with the agent. I explained what happened previously to get him caught up. I let him know the agent I spoke with on the 10th gave me a great deal and I would like to take the offer if it was possible. He explained to me all the agent did was offer me a new account; I didn’t understand because I asked to for my services to simply be transferred with the added features promised to me. I told the agent I would like for my bill to stay at $150 budget. So, he offered double play (cable and internet) at the $150 budget. We set an appointment for Saturday, June 20th and he also sent me a confirmation email.
 On the 19th, I decided to check my Comcast account to make sure there were no charges for my previous address. I saw a bill for charges for June 14th-July 13th. I called the billing department to get the issue resolved. She mentioned I needed to speak to customer resolution and they will take care of the issue. I was transferred to customer resolution but the lady mentioned she needed to transfer me again. I refused and I asked to speak to her supervisor; she hung up the call. I called back and the lady who took care of me this time offered her apologies. She explained to me the agent who took care of my cancellation deleted the wrong account. The only charges I would be billed for are the On Demand rentals totaling $8.98 after taxes, which will be mailed to my new address.
 On the 20th, I got a called from 800-266-2278 at 2:15pm to confirm the appointment. Then I received another phone call from 720-450-9278 at 3:14pm from a gentleman by the name of NELSON PEREZ
 from Comcast wanting to talk to about my recent cancellation. I told him there’s no cancellation and I have an appointment set up today from 2:30-4:30. I explained to him the frustration I’ve been dealing with. He then offers to provide me a $100 gift card, an offer (cable, internet, phone, and home security) at no extra charges to me at rate of 129.99. He would waive the installation and equipment fee for the home security. Provided me with my new telephone number . He offered me a new appointment date which I refused since I had already an appointment set for the day. He mentioned he would call the technician and update the work order to include the phone and home security services. He said I would receive an email within 24 hours. NO EMAIL!
 After the scheduled appointment time had passed, my husband informed me no one showed up for the appointment. He got in touch with Comcast and updated them about our situation. The lady who he spoke to mentioned NELSON PEREZ could not waive any security equipment fees which would be costing us $199 after telling him I didn’t need it. But he insisted it was to compensate for their lack of service. She set us up for an appointment on Thursday, offered us free installation fee, all movie and sports channel, higher Internet speed free of charge for a year. She mentioned to my husband she will send an email. NO EMAIL
 This morning June 21, 2015, I checked my bank account only to find Comcast has charged me the for the cycle June 13th-July 14th for services I’m not receiving after being told I would be billed $8.98 for the On Demand charges.
 I’ve never dealt with such incompetency from a company EVER! I decided to report to the FCC in hopes of finding a better resolution to this lack of customer service, poor communication, inability to follow through, and false impressions. Thank you for taking the time to look into this complaint.

470,"I was having problems with the internet service and I spoke with a representative about the situation and he scheduled a tech to come in 2 days to fix the problem. The tech came and apparantly the entire apartment building had the same problem according to the tech. a previous comcast tech installed a splitter behind the service door that needed to be removed for comcast service to work for our modem. He removed the splitter and all was good, not once did the tech show me anything paper or receipt for coming out or being charged $40 for anything to fix a problem that another comcast tech created. I pay them for the service why do I have to pay them again for fixing a problem that they caused to begin with. This really feels like a scam.

472,"The rate jumped. I tried to change it through the support line but the rates they quoted were higher than the online offers. I ordered the online offer. After the order was confirmed, I received an email that said I already had the services. I called to see what rates I had, and the support rep could not impact the online order or confirm what it was supposed to be and further said that the offer I was quoted earlier in the week was impossible as I was in the second year of an offer. In the end, I'm unsure of what I'm being charged, I have no idea what service I really have now and I don't have any idea how to find someone who can intelligently answer my questions. While I'm not one for a lot of government control, someone needs to do a better job regulating the internet, phone, and cable service pricing and contracting laws.

474,"I had Comcast Internet services/telephone,but decided to get their bundled service of, television and
 home security in March of 2015. I received a bill for $659 in April. My bill is usually $99 to $135. I
 called Comcast on April 10th and questioned why my bill was so high. I said I wanted items removed
 from my bill, such as the security and that I want a monthly payment to be no more than $200. The
 service rep said he removed them. We worked the monthly payment down to the price we agreed too.
 He got the overall bill down to $252 from the $659. This is what I paid at the end of April. However, in
 May,I received another bill for $754. This is after the $253 I paid for the April bill. I called Comcast
 they said they had no record of me calling in April to get these items adjusted on my bill. He is the
 kicker. I have proof and records that show that I spoke to Comcast for 31 minutes on April 10th. I told
 them I want everything removed and that I am closing my account because they are screwing me
 over. The said I would have to pay a $669 and $220 cancellation fees and the $754 bill. I only owe
 about $310 of the bill, not $754. I am writing a complaint to you because I cancelled a bunch of items
 and had a lot of items adjusted in April, yet they are still trying to charge me for them, on top of the
 installation fee for the home security. They want me to pay $1,643. How can I get this resolved?"
475,"Comcast charged me for the 2nd modem that I never had.
 Called them in January, they admitted mistake, however promised to return only 3 months of fees,
 even though I over-paid for much longer period. I've checked recently and they actually didn't remove
 it! So I called back and the same situation happened - they admitted their mistake, however now they
 promised to return only 3 months from now. This hasn't happened yet. So, I'm being overcharched for
 close to 2 years now and they refuse to return the money."
476,"My wife and I were looking at a house to purchase at . in Concord Ca. It is on the edge of the city area so we made sure to call Comcast and other providers to make sure that we would be covered in the case of having internet service. Both of us work from home so it was quite a primary concern that we have fast and reliable internet, and Comcast was our current provider in the house we were leaving. The fact that they were going to work there was all we needed to hear, but just to make sure, we even called twice.
 A month or so after that, we have the house and we are getting ready to move in. So we call to get the service started only to find out, Comcast does not have service in that area. But it's only 7000 feet away. So they would call us back, and there may be a fee involved, but they can get us hooked up. They did call back, after I made numerous calls to them. They gave me the figure of $180,000 to run the line to our house. I was absolutely floored.
 So we couldn't possibly entertain that number. We have since delayed our move and had to seek out many other alternatives to get the service we required to move in, costing us many thousands of dollars in additional rent among other costs. I have had to take several days off of work to get the microwave wireless service set up. We now have a much lower speed service at roughly 4 times the cost of Comcast that we are forced to use, just to get some basic service. We would never have bought the house if we had known. We are looking to sell the house now very soon and hopefully we won't lose out on that deal as well. We were looking forward to having our own isolated place where we could work from home in peace and it has become an absolute nightmare.
 As if to add insult to this injury, Comcast has since informed me that I will be responsible for a $50 cancellation fee on my previous service because I have moved out of their service area. Despite the fact that I checked with them multiple times to make sure I was in the service area.
 Thank you for your time,

477,"I have subscribed to a Comcast Xfinity internet service plan with advertised speeds of 25Mbps since December 2014 and am based in Concord, NH. I work from home and require frequent, fast access to a variety of data services. Although 25Mbps should be sufficient for my usage needs, I have found through Comcast's own testing software that I do not even get half of this advertised speed. Their own tools show I receive from 7-9Mbps speeds during non-peak usage hours. This is apparently not due to any type of connection limitation, as their technician verified the signal strength of the connection during their December installation visit.
 Prior to December, I was working in Tokyo, Japan where I had a residential fiber optic internet connection with 200Mbps connectivity for the equivalent of $40/mo. This makes Comcast's deficiencies all the more glaring and unforgivable. My return to the US has been a bitter experience, to say the least, in regard to the subpar communications infrastructure. It is even more insulting that I am paying more for less here. That, in itself, might be more tolerable if I even received the speeds I am paying for.
 It's alarming that Comcast wants to merge with TWC, considering their status as one of America's most disliked companies in terms of consumer satisfaction. Even if the merger does not happen, however, the reality for me remains that as a resident of Concord, I have no other choice apart from Comcast. Punctuating Comcast's disregard for service quality is the fact that they advertise a certain level of internet service and then severely under-deliver.
 At this point, I have no other choice except to approach the FCC with my complaint, with the hope of seeing some type of improvement from Comcast. At the very least, I think I deserve to actually get the services I am paying for.

 I am in receipt of a copy of the letter send to the FCC by Vanessa Fisher of Comcast on May 13, 2015. In her letter, Ms. Fisher states that ""I attempted to contact several times to discuss his concerns. Unfortunately, my attempts were unsuccessful."" Ms. Fisher goes on to state that in order to resolve the issue, it is necessary to speak with me directly.
 Ms. Fisher did indeed reach out to my home phone during business hours, leaving a voice mail with her contact information. Likewise, she also emailed me on May 11, 2015 with a summary of the matter and her request to speak with me. As I had been traveling at the time, upon return I attempted to reply to both Ms. Fisher's voice mail and email on May 19 and May 20, respectively.
 Neither of my initial replies received a response from Ms. Fisher. I once again attempted to email her on May 22, which again received no response. I once again reached out to Ms. Fisher on May 29 (this morning) to alert her that I have not received any response to any of my messages and that I am still suffering with connectivity issues. On the afternoon of May 29, I received the copy of Comcast's letter to the FCC and subsequently reached out again to Ms. Fisher by both voice mail and email to let her know that I will be making every effort, on each business day going forward to connect with her on this issue, to find a satisfactory resolution.
 This issue is not resolved and Comcast has yet to make any substantial effort toward its resolution.

 Representatives from Comcast's management team have followed-up with me, and during the last two days have resolved all of the outstanding issues."
478,"I've had Comcast ""high speed"" internet (up to 75 Mbps) for a month. Almost every time I try to use the internet (online gaming, video streaming, visiting websites), my sessions time out. When I called Comcast about this, they told me that they could detect no issues on their end. When I called again, they said the same thing but told me that they would send a technician out to determine the issue. They also told me there was a possibility that they would charge me for this, even though I was merely asking them to deliver service that they promised me on a contract. Of course, when the technician came, the internet was working completely fine and I was measuring decent speeds (download of about 25 Mbps). The very next day, the same issues I had before were happening again. Also, Verizon told me that they don't know if they can service my house (despite the fact that my neighbors across the street have them), so I literally have no choice but to use Comcast (as they've become an effective monopoly).

479,"I've been a Comcast customer at this address for 4 months. I pay $39.99 per month for 30 mbps download speeds.
 There has been a regular and recurring issue with download speed that starts immediately following any bandwidth-intensive task (such as streaming a movie on Netflix, downloading a large file, connecting to a VPN, etc). It happens at least 5 times per week.
 After a bandwidth-intensive task has been completed, internet speeds are slowed to a crawl for a period of about 10-30 minutes. It is so bad that simple web pages do not even load, and no devices on the WiFi network are able to connect.
 My girlfriend and I call it our ""Internet Time Out,"" as if Comcast is punishing us for using our service. Once the ""Time Out"" is over, we are able to connect again at normal speeds.
 It is incredibly frustrating to be penalized for simply using our internet normally. It seems like Comcast is purposely throttling internet usage once their system notices that we are using a greater amount of bandwidth than simple web page viewing.

480,"I pay upwards of $150.00 / month for the last 11+ years. I have never seen lack of service and
 disregard for providing same in my lifetime, until NOW. I have had an ongoing problem with
 broadband over the last 2 years sporadically, until the last month when I've called numerous times
 regarding lack of internet service (intermittently), particularly when I've been working from home and
 blaming my work CITRIX (when in fact it wasn't). Comcast has been down most of this past week but
 they've not notified ANY CUSTOMER that it will be down, the time frame for same or when it will be
 back up. I've exchanged modems which went bad, I've called stating I have no phone service (as I
 have the internet, television, phone - or maybe NOT). I've had to take my cell phone to bed with me or
 charge it in my car to be sure I don't lose that overnight! As I live alone, this is the most maddening of
 situations and what I'm getting is (Wednesday 5/20/15) they'll schedule a technician to come out on
 the 29th???? REALLY? I even had a second person I'd called (after the first one told me someone
 would call me back in 30 minutes and after 1.5 hours) tell me that service in the entire area where I
 live was down but the first person didn't tell me this - I could have gone in to work and been there but
 I waited for their call. They offered me $20 and stated they would note it so I could get ""credit"" which
 has NEVER HAPPENED. REALLY? I make $40/hour and lost time because of it! I want something
 DONE!"
481,"My internet bill was recently raised by $20/mo. I do not understand why I should be charged more by my ISP for the same exact internet service I received for a year. If the service in question can be afforded to me and others for a set rate, why then should that rate be increased for no reason? I've attached documentation of the discrepancies in my billing. Although I've received the same exact services over the last 3 months (Xfinity Internet Package, HBO), the billing of these services constantly fluctuate. This is essentially like raising the cost of a toll on a highway, except there are no inflationary reasons given as to why it's suddenly more expensive, it just is. What I pay for internet doubled and ISP's shouldn't be allowed to raise your rate by such a significant amount, especially with no explanation as to why beyond ""your introductory period has lapsed."" This shouldn't be allowed. Thank you.

482,"I was charged for a service call to my house. The technician made a repair to a line a previous technician botched. Comcast has said that the charge is valid, and I've asked to speak to a supervisor to contest the charges. Each time, I was told that I'd receive a call within 24-48 hours. No one has contacted me. They have told me that someone called. I did not receive a call or a voicemail (my contact number is my cell phone) I've called six times and tried over chat and the charges still stand. I have not spoken to 1 supervisor over the phone. A supervisor addressed me over chat, but in the end he/she said that they are unable to help me because they are over sees and that I need to speak to the local office (which I have tired numerous times). I've explained that the repair that was done was for something their previous tech did, but I can't seem to get through. I am paying monthly for a service. From October until this last visit to my house my internet was intermittent. It works fine now but I dont agree with the charges and would like to speak to someone that will understand why I am contesting it.

483,"I moved in February to this address, and, after having good service with Comcast in the past, decided to move my service, as well. On February 9, 2015, I spoke with a Comcast Representative, and she arranged to have my service moved, with a technician coming to hook it up at the new address on February 11th. That technician did not show up, and we rescheduled for a week later, on February 18th. That technician also did not show up.
 I have now had a series of appointments (a total of 12), including four that have been rescheduled without my knowledge, and only three that actually showed up. The first technician could not hook up our system due to weather. The second actually did hook up the system, but left it running at a less than optimal rate, because of temporary wiring that had to be put in. The third technician came to replace the temporary wiring, but diagnosed a different problem with the wiring, that required a contractor to replace. He scheduled an appointment for the contractor to do so (which has a 12 hour window, much too long for someone who works to have to be at home waiting for someone who might or might not show...)
 That appointment was scheduled for today, however, sometime between me speaking to Comcast at 8:30 this morning and again at 6:00 this evening, the appointment was rescheduled again without my knowledge.
 After 2 months and 7 days, I still do not have working internet service, I am paying them $90 a month, and have spoken to them on the phone a total of 46 times, with no results.
 Were it not for a lack of options that fit our needs here in Memphis, I would have cancelled this service long ago, and gone with another provider.

484,"Originally when we moved to Memphis, TN from our previous residence we signed a contract with Comcast for 105Mbps Internet (no data cap). It was expensive but justifiably useful. Our household has a family of 5, all heavily connected to the internet be it for work, school or leisure. Modern high-school and college courses require mandatory streaming of supplementary lectures online, the download and upload of large assignments (from film to engineering projects), download and sharing of books/notes and more. We were shocked when Comcast upped our monthly bill in 2013 and instituted mandatory data caps with no option for us as a consumer to pay more to avoid caps (instituting usage based billing on a renewable resource). 300GB a month is an impossibly small amount of data for the average family to survive on and directly impacts how we utilize our 105Mbps of data. Please stick with me while I explain.
 Comcast is allowed to sell us 105Mbps of data-rate a month but footnote a cap. Bandwidth is a measurement over time, something not used in a moment of time is effectively wasted.
 105Mbps with a mandatory cap of 300GB a month means theoretically Comcast is selling us about 7-8 hours of internet a month. They should not be allowed to misrepresent 8 hours of maximum theoretical internet time as 105Mbps of data transfer speeds per month at the price they quote me. This is obviously not a realistic number as generally we have about 50% real-world overhead for LAN with no bottlenecks. So we'll say 12 hours of data a month.
 Now just assuming the above alone we are also being charged for the 10% of overhead all internet processes are subjected to (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Nagle/summary.html) which is actually part of the Official Protocol Standards (STD 1: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2001.html) but our bill does not reflect a 10% grace, we are charged for physical limitations of reality.
 Frankly though, no one will ever agree to accurately advertising your service in this objective manner so I pose a more logical alternative.
 If one has a 300GB data cap, and is purchasing internet, the ISP should be barred from referencing these false data rates.
 300GB a month is 300GB divided by 30 days = 10 divided by 24 hours = .41667 divided by 60 minutes = .0069444 divided by 60 seconds = about 116KBps.
 Comcast is illegally calling my 105Mbps package broadband when in reality (per usage based billing) I am only receiving 116KBps monthly allowance at a sustained 24/hour usage (remember, bandwidth is a measurement over time, so they cannot assume I'm not using the data 24/7 in an advertisement).
 116KBps is not broadband as classified by the FCC. It isn't even close, and based on my monthly bill it should be downright illegal. I don't have any options for Broadband where I live. Comcast is allegedly the only one in my area. But math does not lie, and proves that they are wrongfully advertising what I pay for (105Mbps/300GB) as broadband when any rational state-educated human can see this is not the case.
 Comcast claims the data cap is only for Memphis as well, that is what it says in my contract, but I live in Cordova and am still subjected to this malicious and downright criminal practice. I plan to also file advertising complaints with the FTC for this as well.
 Please FCC, bar ISPs from being able to call capped plans ""broadband"" and require by law accurate description of what the customer is purchasing much like in the AOL days when you purchased ""hours"" of internet because that is effectively what Comcast is selling me.
 The only ethical and moral thing to do is advertise as theoretical hour usage per month (which will turn away all customers) or truthful bandwidth per month based on the cap you pay for (in my case 116KBps).
 Networks should never be allowed to cap it as a resource like oil. Quality of service management like peak hour throttling is more than reasonable but data caps are stifling innovation and bleeding the American family dry. Don't let them pillage what the United Nations called a ""universal human right.""
 Can you imagine an America where the FTC allows the auto industry to sell a car capable of 40MPG but only the car can only travel 40 miles a month, and the rest of the month the car has to sit in the garage or the driver is charged exorbitant fees to travel.
 Please FCC, do the right thing. Help us out from under this data cap or at least force Comcast to adjust our billing based on the REAL data transfer speed they sell us, 116KBps.

Later that same day, checking my account online, I see that the agent made the account change anyway, regardless of the fact that I clearly declined it multiple times.

490,"An unexplained Comcast bill exists as unpaid on my credit report. When contacted, Comcast has no history of any such unpaid bill. Comcast has yet to remove this alleged unpaid bill from my credit report. You would think they would bill me directly since I am a current paying Comcast customer -- if the bill did actually exist.
 Secondly, when making a personal inquiry at Comcast's office locally, Comcast officials are unable to explain why my bill is higher than other customers with the exact same service. While I pay close to $80 a month for JUST internet service (I don't have any TV, phone service with Comcast), other customers pay closer to $50. This is taking into account promotions and offers that extend for roughly 6-12 months. When comparing customer bills that have extended beyond the promotional offers (such as $20 off for 6 months), I seem to pay more. I have yet to get an explanation as to how they arrived at $79.95 a month.

They replaced my modem 5 times since I have signed up and have sent out two technicians. My internet data speeds and performance have never lived up to the outlined performance standards Comcast publishes for more than 30 days. Finally in late May I was transferred to retention where a representative made some additional adjustments to my account and replaced my modem again. I continued to have issues with performance and reported them to their tech support group in early June, since then the performance has lived up to their commitments (not been 30 days yet). Today I received a bill for $190.14, at no point did I authorize my bill to increase as a result of them resolving my issues nor was I ever informed of an increase. This is the second time they have added fraudulent charges to my bill. I expect the $190.14 to be credited to my account, the billing to be corrected back to the normal $45.71 (taxes included) it was over the previous months, and a $150 credit to be issued as a result of the ongoing issues and poor service.

494,"My COMCAST bill is extreme for Internet Service. I am required to pay $76.95 a month to have internet. This is above the setup fee I had to pay in order to get COMCAST to run a cable from the nearby pole that cost me $1200.00 dollars! That is correct, one thousand two hundred dollars to run a cable from a pole to my house. That would have cost me $1900.00 if I hadn't negotiated and talked them down. Additionally, they charge a 10 fee (part of the $76.95 bill) for Wireless Gateway, when I am running my own wireless off of my personally owned router!

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/23/2015 2:50:29 PM:
 I would like to add more information to my complaint. I am in a monopoly area for COMCAST (XFINITY). No other providers are in this area, which I am sure is why I was required to spend $1200 in order for my cable to be installed initially. Additionally, I am paying $66.95 a month for the ""Performance High Speed Internet"" deal, which is a 25MB download connection ONLY with no TV channels, and another $10 on top of that for Wireless Gateway service. This seems extreme as this is not even close to their ""Starter SurePrice Double Play"" package which has a 50MB service and includes 140 TV channels for a mere $13 more than what I currently pay. Also, to get my Internet service from COMCAST, I am REQUIRED to have a Voice or TV subscription as well. Why is there no option for a true high speed 50MB download connection from them that doesn't include some form of TV subscription? They are bundling all their internet services and requiring TV or Voice subscriptions to artificially inflate their subscriber cable numbers. I would definitely purchase an internet only plan if it was offered and affordable.

495,"Comcast has issued datacaps in select areas and I find it unfair. The datacap is 300 GB, but I find that unsatisfactory. My main source of entertainment is online providers such as Netflix and Hulu, and watching these at 1080p a few times a day per person in my household (4) has us reaching this cap very quickly. That is followed by an extra 10 dollar charge per 50 gigabytes. Considering this is only in select areas, and comcast plans to expand later, I urge you to stop their actions now before more customers are affected by this.

496,"I pay a ridiculous amount for Comcast Internet and cable each month, and It doesn't work about 40% of the time. When I'm streaming Netflix it cuts out. Using wifi on my phone cuts out all the time. I then spend more time unplugging and trying to restart the router over and over, and half the time that doesn't even work. So I pay 115$ a month for it not to work more than 40% of the time.

497,"Complaint: Comcast has been charging me a $10 monthly router rental fee, when I use my own.
 History: When I started service with Comcast on 06/01/14 I notified customer service and verified with
 the installation technician that I would be using my own device and would not need to rent a Comcast
 device. I called a week after installation to verify automatic payment and paperless billing and was
 told that I would not be charged for rental.
 20 March 2015, I called Comcast to downgrade my service and review my account. After being
 denied a downgrade I was notified that I was also being charged a $10 rental fee since I upgraded
 service in September 2014. I was frustrated with the customer service representative after being
 refused further information on my account and details on why I couldn't downgrade service. I
 requested to be transfered to a supervisor. The supervisor was empathetic and wanted to ""look into""
 negotiating a bundle packet to suit my needs and also remedy the rental charge (from September
 2014). The supervisor gave me a ticket number and said that they would call a week later. I waited 10
 days and called back to see what the issue was. After speaking with 3 different customer service reps
 I found out that a ticket was never submitted to refund me the rental fee or downgrade my service.
 Another disappointing discovery was made during that phone call. The customer service rep notified
 me that the rental charge has been on my account since I started service June 2014. I tried to speak
 with a supervisor again to reveal any further miscommunication but was told to wait a few days for a
 supervisor to call me back. They never did and since then I've called Comcast several times to see
 about a refund and downgrading my service to basic internet but was quickly told to wait patiently.
 While I've been waiting, I'm paying for a bundle service that I've requested to be downgraded from
 because I can't afford it and I still haven't received a full refund for their error.
 My request: Have Comcast refund me $120 for the rental fee and downgrade my service to my
 original basic internet plan for $39.99/month."
498,"Let me start this out by saying that my experience with comcast started out easily enough. My roommate and I decided we wanted to get high speed internet of our own, as the current internet was too slow. So we called up comcast to get a deal on 125/125 Mbps internet and cable. The deal was for 99 a month, a bit steep, but fair enough. We were told that there would be no other fees, that this was what we would pay per month. Knowing comcast like we did, we knew this wouldnt be the case as we found out when we opened the first bill which was upwards of 140 dollars.
 Fast forward to us moving to a different location, about 20 minutes away. We called to setup the move and they were happy to do so. They informed us a tech was required to install the new equipment, which was a 30 dollar fee. We told them we didn't need a tech to plug in the modem, we could do it ourselves. They agreed and cancelled the technician. A few hours later, we received an email from Comcast showing that a tech would be here and telling us of the 30 dollar fee. So, back to the phones we go to talk to comcast and get this figured out. After 2 hours and being transferred to 4-5 different people, we got the tech canceled, or so we thought.
 We moved and brought our equipment with us, it's supposed to be plug and play. Well, our internet worked, but not our cable. We are in the process of moving, so we wait a few days to call them and inquire, hoping it will solve itself. We make the call to Comcast and after 3 hours and who knows how much more transferring, we find out that not only did they cancel our tech, but they CANCELED OUR SERVICE ENTIRELY. Not a big deal they tell us, they can rebuild the account from old bills and get everything going again. They say they will call us at 10 that night, and of course there was no phone call. We call the next day to find out that the tech we talked to the night before was wrong, they can't rebuild the account and since what we had was a promotion we can no longer get that price for the package. So now we have to pay 5-10 dollars MORE because Comcast is terrible at what they do, but there aren't any comparable competitors in the area for internet, so what choice do we have?
 So we agree to this reluctantly because we have been on the phone for HOURS and are getting nowhere with anyone. So fine, we have internet and cable, but we need NEW EQUIPMENT. OF COURSE!!!! So they send us this new equipment, we have it a few weeks and notice our internet speed is not even close to what it should be. Call comcast to find out why, turns out they sent us the WRONG EQUIPMENT. So now we have to take this equipment and go to a comcast retailer to get NEW equipment. So now we pay about 145-150 dollars a month for cable and internet, for which we don't even get half of the speed we pay for most of the time and it goes out intermittently. Can you believe they actually tried to tell us that it's normal to lose over half of our speed constantly?

499,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I asked to remove cable television from my service package. Initially, I was ""forced"" into taking a package when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription to keep a low rate. Originally it was supposed to last for a year (it only lasted for 6 months and I had issues with billing being incorrect and charging for the “blast” part of the internet service). This package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own was over 60 a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have rarely watched cable television.
 When I moved a year later to a different city in the same area, my price had increased to 70 a month. I called in and was told that the charge to install service at my new place was 40 total. I agreed since there was no way around it; someone had used Comcast in the past 5 years but they said the lines were disconnected (they weren’t according to the tech who came out). Due to the fact that I had both internet (which I own the modem and router) and television through them, Comcast billed me 40 per service (total of 80). When I called in, I was told that no one there could take off the second charge even though it could be proven through call logs that I only agreed to 40 total. I was offered a reduced rate of 50 a month. I accepted and then afterwards they mentioned that they’d have to change my television service from ~45 channels down to basic local (the same ones I can get in HD with an OTA antenna). Since then, I have not even hooked up my cable television box.
 There were three new charges on my bill for Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax after the 4th month. Since I didn’t agree to these charges, I had to call in and fight with them to get it taken off. After the 6th month, my bill went back up to where it is now (70 + taxes and fees). I have called multiple times to try to get my bill back down to the 50 a month a bunch of neighbors in the same city have paid for longer than I’ve lived out here. Since I have the lowest tier of television, they say there’s nothing I can do until I reduce the speed of my internet service. Even then, if I drop to half the speed I am at right now, it would only take off 5 a month. In fact, if I take off my cable service they will increase the price to over 75 a month.
 Normally, I’d be okay with an introductory offer going away, but at every turn I have been jacked around by Comcast. I have even tried going through their “executive service department”, and their normal lines via phone, via chat; all of them ended up with them stating that any change to my service will cost more. Then I have a new “free offer” on my bill that they very explicitly know I will not use. The amount of time and effort I’ve made to rectify my bill and service every 3 to 6 months is abhorrent.
 So my question becomes why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want or need.
 My other belief is that if you don’t have services or products that have huge profit margins for them, then they are unwilling to deal with you. Case in point, I own my own modem and router because in my professional experience their hardware is not up to par. First it’s locked down so certain tweaks such as changing your wireless channel cannot be done. Second, they have turned on wireless sharing so that their modems broadcast a network from your home without your knowledge for their other customers. On top of owning my own modem and router, I don’t need cable so I don’t subscribe to HBO or any premium channels like that. I don’t have phone through them, which is a very very cheap thing to implement on their end but they charge a lot of money for the service and the equipment needed (compare to a service such as Ooma where you buy a box once and then you only pay regulatory taxes and fees each month. In a year it’s less than 10 a month). So because I basically just want good, fast broadband internet I am paying way more than I should to subsidize their other customers.
 They also uphold unfair billing practices by attesting that “new” customers and “retail” customers are different people. When a person down the street from me hands me their previous 2 years of bills and they show the same speed internet I have without cable for 50 a month, but Comcast claims that I cannot have the same price for the same service, I believe that is unfair. Right now, in my current market, I could get 50% more speed for 50% less price. In other markets where Comcast has competition, they have dropped their prices or increased their speeds for the same price, separate from having cable television.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

During these times, the members of our household cannot load internet pages in a timely fashion, and sometimes the pages do not load at all.

501,"Prior to our move 3 years ago I called Comcast (we were current customers) two times to confirm that I could get internet at our potential new home and they said I could. When we moved in July 2012 and attempted to get it they said that we were unable unless we paid $12000 to have them run and install. Now that I am wanting to start to work from home and the kids need internet for school, I am in the need of high speed internet. Our neighbor that is aprox 800 ft away does have Comcast. Comcast again today said that they can not provide to my home due to the distance. Is there any other action that I can take? I can not afford to pay $12000 especially when I know that my neighbor has it. Is there federal grants or actions that I can take?

502,"Comcast has changed their billing plan from unlimited data to a 300GB cap (+$10 for each 50GB over
 the cap that you use each month). In their FAQ about the change, Comcast stated, ""In all of our trial
 markets except Tucson, the data amount included with all XFINITY Internet tiers was increased from
 250 GB to 300 GB per month"". That is a lie. It was not increased at all; we have gone from unlimited
 internet usage to capped. This takes advantages of families with multiple internet users, such as my
 family of 4. The marginal cost of unlimited vs 300GB data to Comcast does not justify the price it
 charges its customers. Comcast gets away with this only because of the uncompetitive, monopolistic
 nature of internet service in my area (Comcast only). It's exploitative and deceitful, especially to users
 who are uninformed and unaware that they are being lied to by their ISP."
503,"This complaint is regarding Xfinity Home Security Service. I ordered the service along with Internet
 service, the company called ""Doblue Play"". Today, I found out that there is overcharge for the
 equipment installed for home security. I called Comcast first, after long explaination of my concerns,
 a rep transfered me to Home Security Service Billing Departement. I explained long story again but it
 was helpless. A rep and supervisor told me that I have additional equipments installed. What I
 cannot understand is that I never ordered addtional equipments. The technician should have installed
 the equipments which are included in the package I ordered. But, the rep said any how, addtional
 equipments installed so I have to pay for them. I told her that this is unfair. The reason is that first, I
 didn't order addtional equiments, if there must be addtional charges, the technician should have
 explained to me. When I order the service is the service I wanted. Not mor than that. Now, I have to
 pay for something which I didn't order at all. I don't know why the technician installed too many
 euqipments and didn't explain about the addtional charges. I thought those equipments installed
 were all inclued on the service package I ordered. When I signed on the contract, I wasn't that much
 aware of that there were additioan equipments. I just made sure that if theire were any other charges,
 the tech said no, just need to pay $299 installation fee. That's why I signed on the contract.
 Sencond, Comcast didn't show those charges on the first bill. If Comcast shows those charges on
 the first bill, I would have canceled its servie with 30 day money back guranteed. They show the
 charge on the 2nd bill which generated exactly on the end of the day of 30day money back gurateed.
 So, the supervisor of Xfinity Home Security Service Billing Department said that Sorry, but I have to
 pay for addtional equipments. I told him that please take the equipments back then, He said "" it's all
 yours"" . Nope I don't want it. I didn't even want addtional equioment. ""You guys installed what you
 guys wanted, and now, I have to pay for it?? it's insane."" He said, I can cancel the servise with $880
 penalty.
 If the technician mistakenly installed the addtional equipments, that's also Comcast's fault, so, the
 company has to correct it. Also, showing addtional charges on the billing statement after passing 30
 day moneyback gurantted period seems like deceiving customers.
 I cannot tolerate its lackadaisical attitude toward customers who trust big name of the company."
504,"On 05/26/2015 a representative from comcast called me and told me that they were upgrading my
 internet speed to 50MBPS and sending me a streaming device for $39.99. Today 05/28/2015 I
 received a cable box. I called comcast baffled because in no way did I agree to sign up for cable TV. I
 then asked if I could have the 50 MBPS internet and I was told comcast could not honor this price and
 that just the internet would be $49.99. I am somewhat baffled as to how comcast signed me up for
 cable TV without explicitly stating they were signing me up for cable tv. What is even more frustrated
 is that they practice unfair, dishonest, and unethical pricing given that they have a TRUE monopoly in
 my area. There is no other high speed internet service provider, so they can raise my rate and do
 whatever they please because I have no other options."
505,"I moved my family of four from Florida, where I had Comcast and an ""unenforced"" 250GB cap where I averaged 300GB/month, to the Atlanta suburbs where Comcast is limiting people to a 300GB cap before charging them $10 per 50GB for overage. The thing is, in the month of May we did nothing different than what we had done in Florida, and yet our usage is 689GB. Why? I can only assume it's because the Comcast service I pay for here is over twice as fast, so I can only assume that the streaming video sites we use regularly (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube) detected the higher bandwidth capabilities and delivered higher quality content, thus using more of our bandwidth. This seems anticompetitive as my whole family must now worry about using competing video services, a fear that benefits Comcast, lest we get charged more and more and more for simply using the service we already pay handsomely for. All it seems I can do is write you and pray Google Fiber eventually makes it here.

507,"If you are going to allow Comcast to redefine broadband access with their 300 GB data cap, they should at the very minimum be required to provide tools to monitor an manage usage.
 Currently the only tools they provide are not at all helpful in managing usage. They have a web page labeled ""My Current Usage"" but it is not only not ""current"", it does not even tell you when the snapshot of ""current usage"" was last updated. It only gives a date.
 Comcast has been granted monopoly or near monopoly power in most areas where they provide service. Consequently, they must be regulated and not permitted to simply wring every last dollar possible from every customer.

508,"I live in an area where Comcast is setting the overall limit on their Internet plans to 300 GB per month. This is a practice that was changed after I started service with them in 2012. Given that I have no alternatives for ISPs I had no choice but to continue to use Comcast. What I am finding now is that I exceed the 300 GB per month limit regularly and I must pay an additional $10 per 50 GB used beyond that point.
 When I contacted Comcast regarding the option to purchase an Internet plan with a higher limit than 300 GB I was told none are available. So there is no option for me but to pay the overage charge every month for the same service which I used to receive for $66.95.
 It seems that this practice of setting a data limit on a service where none existed before and then also providing no alternative has created a system where Comcast can charge whatever rate they want for their service. If Comcast decided tomorrow to reduce the limit to 200 GB I would be forced to pay more and there is nothing I could do about it apart from disconnecting their service entirely.
 Will there be some regulation in the future that would require ISPs such as Comcast to at least offer an unlimited data option for me to purchase?
 Thank you for your consideration.

509,"Comcast's data caps are clearly designed to push power users into signing multi-year contracts for their uncapped ""business class"" service. Since Atlanta's a captive monopoly market, consumers have no choice but to conserve bandwidth or agree to an even more one-sided agreement.
 My work requires all-day streaming conferences, which uses quite a bit of data. Coupled with teenagers using Netflix and Youtube, my supposed $99/mo Comcast bill often exceeded $160, after Comcast charged me for ""data overages"". Comcast charged these overages in 50gb blocks, normally at the end of the month. Often they would charge me for a 50gb block on the 29th, and I would only use 1-3gb of it before the 1st. Blocks do not carry over to the next month.
 Since Comcast has no real competitors in the Atlanta Metro, I had no choice but to convert to their ""Business Class"" plan. This service is identical to their Residential service -- same modem, same network -- except that it is unbundled from Cable TV, and is uncapped -- and locked me in to a multi-year contract. Worse, the terms of service require Mandatory Binding Arbitration, which prevents me from receiving a fair trial in the likely event of Comcast breaching their service agreement with me.

510,"Comcast is enforcing a 300GB data cap in the Atlanta area, and it is leading to me paying an excessive amount of money to for ""additional usage"". $10 per 50GB block.
 First of all, I do not live in Atlanta. I live 34 miles north of the city perimeter, therefore I believe I should be restricted by the cap for Atlanta.
 Second, the cap is not enforced in all areas of the United States, and in areas where the cap is enforced, certain areas have higher caps than others. I should not be penalized and charged more to use the same network.
 Additionally, in order to keep my monthly rate down, it is cheaper for me to have phone service bundled with my TV and internet than it would be to have the same service without phone. I have never used the phone service and I do not plan to. This seems to me like a way for Comcast to be able to artificially inflate the number of phone service users in order to advertise a higher number of users.
 To summarize, I do not live in Atlanta and should not be bound to the city's data cap, and I should not be forced to take extra services that I do not use in order to lower my bill.

511,"Comcast has sent me warnings of approaching or exceeding their cable internet data usage ""threshold"" multiple times over the past year. This past billing statement, they charged me $10 for going over this blatant usage cap, then providing me a $10 ""courtesy credit"" because they provide three grace overages in a 12-month period.

514,"In April 2015 we saw a Comcast employee in a cherry-picker working on the telephone/internet lines behind our house (without notifying us). When he left, our Comcast internet was down. I called Comcast the same day, explained what had happened, and they said the earliest they could send someone to fix it was two days later. I was promised that we would receive a credit for the days we would be without service.
 When the Comcast technician came two days later, he explained that it appeared that the other employee had placed some kind of ""filter"" on our line, due to a ""leaking signal"" which he said would cause them to be fined by the FCC. He was able to climb up to the line and remove the filter, which immediately started our internet working again. He mentioned that the leak seemed to be on our neighbor's line, not ours, and could offer no explanation for why the filter was placed on our line nor why we were not notified of this in advance or at the time the filter was placed.
 Thereafter on our next bill, we were not credited for the days we had been without service as we had been promised, and in addition Comcast charged us an additional $70 for the ""service call."" I called Comcast and was promised that the $70 would be refunded and we would receive an additional credit of $20 for the days without service.
 On the next bill, we did receive the $20 credit but not the $70 ""service fee"" refund. Today, I called Comcast to inquire about the $70 refund and was told that in fact we would not receive the credit because the ""service fee"" was a valid charge. Comcast had no record of what had transpired during the technician's visit nor my previous conversations with their representatives in which I was promised to be refunded for the $70 charge. After escalating the dispute I was able to get them to agree to credit me for the $70. I have not seen this actually show up on my account yet, and until then am not confident that they will actually follow through since apparently they have no system to track the promises that are made to customers over the phone.
 My complaint is regarding the initial service problem we had, with Comcast basically shutting off our service without notifying us due to some vague ""leaking signal"" which was never fully explained to me. When the technician came out all he did was take the filter off and never said what would happen if the signal continued to ""leak,"" which apparently was bad enough that they had to shut off the signal in the first place. Then, I feel like we were basically held hostage by Comcast whereby they feel they can just come out and shut off our service arbitrarily, then charge us $70 to turn it back on! After arguing at length with their escalation department I was able to get them to agree to a one-time credit of the service fee but they were clear that any future calls would definitely be subject to the fee. They offered that I could subscribe to a ""protection plan"" for an additional monthly charge to presumably prevent this from happening, which appears completely unethical.

 this month's bill they now have added a $9.50 late charge for not paying the $74.50. They will not

 There is no reason for Comcast to believe that they own the modem or that they gave me a modem. Their customer service is often rude, incompetent, and gives conflicting information on how to permanently fix this problem. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only cable internet provider in my area.

518,"I have been using Comcast for my Cable / Internet for the past couple of years and have noticed a
 sudden increase of overages and charges for Internet usage without any changes in our household
 Internet habits. When speaking with customer service, they say that they can confirm that our usage
 has increased, but cannot verify to us how they are able to measure this increase. We also find it
 interesting while researching this issue on the Internet that there are many other customers that seem
 to experiencing very similar issues of overcharges. And also during the same time line. I want my
 Internet provider, Comcast, to be able to give me a detailed accounting of my usage so I can address
 my usage in my household, or address the possibility that their measurement system is flawed. If it is
 on their end, I have then been overcharged hundreds of dollars over the course of the last six months
 alone. Thanks for you time -

We don't often have this slow speed during the day when everyone is at work, however, on occasion it has become very slow even then. How long can they continue to bill us for services undelivered?

522,"I don't believe Comcast's 300 gig data cap is fair or reasonable. I pay for 60 Mbps internet. With a family of 4, we are hovering around or crossing the cap every month. They are selling a product where I pay for a month, but at maximum bandwidth use I would use up my allotted data in less then 8 hours. In addition, I don't trust their meters. For example in January I was notified of an overage and charged for an extra 50 gigs. Being the last day of the month, I decided to download some steam games so I could at least use some of the 50 gigs I payed for. I have to be careful about when I download games I purchase as they can be anywhere from 1-25+ gigs. Despite using the data in January, it was applied to February and caused another overage. I think this issue could be be as big as net neutrality as the size of media increases.

524,"We are a technology driven family; both my husband and I telecommute on a regular basis in technology based fields. I am an online educator and my husband is a computer programmer. All four of our children are proficient in computer usage and have their own internet accessible devices for school and personal use. We are Comcast Cable Internet subscribers at one of the highest tiers and we are forced to yield to an unreasonably LOW and ridiculous data cap of 300 Gb per month for a family of 6. Unbelievably, this is the highest data cap of all of the speed tiers. Once we reach that data cap, we must pay $10 for each additional 50 Gb of data. In addition, because we use Apple devices nearly exclusively, we are throttled by a message from Comcast stating we are near our data cap each month. This message will throttle internet usage until you clear it by clicking OK. The issue is that the error does not display on Macbooks which is what we nearly exclusively use. We have to wait for Comcast to clear the issue on their end which is a hassle. In addition we also receive phone calls for when we near our data cap and when we have actually exceeded the data cap making the computer message really not even needed. If we had any other option for internet service, we would gladly look into it, however in our area there is NO competition for Comcast in terms of speed. DSL and U-Verse by AT& T are a joke and do not offer much better speeds than dial-up! Comcast needs competition; I have placed our city on the wish list for Google Fiber, but so far our city is not in Google's immediate plans for expansion. In today's society where HD online streaming is continually building a larger audience and becoming the norm, we are being punished by cable companies such as Comcast for reaching arbitrary data caps that they have created. We are cable cutters; we got rid of cable a few years ago and have never looked back. We love the freedom of choosing to subscribe on our own terms to Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. We rent movies through our Apple TV instantly and thus are using streaming for movie rentals as well. It seems as if Comcast is now instituting these data caps as a way to secure more profit and make up for the cable cutters like myself. Cable is going the way of the dinosaur, and for good reason. It is not fair that Comcast is forcing their customers to pay a penalty for Comcast' own refusal to keep pace with the changing landscape of digital media and society. To show that the cable company is aware of what they are doing, I asked a Comcast sales person just yesterday when they called to try to woo me back to cable, if the data used in watching their cable programs as a cable subscriber would count in my monthly data cap. The answer: NO; we offer our own streaming service and it does not count in the data usage as Netflix would. It is the SAME DATA! They are unfairly trying to force out competition by creating data caps to limit the streaming their customers use outside of their cable infrastructure. It is wrong and it is time for a change. The data caps are simply in place to net more money and serve no other true purpose. We need competition, removal of data caps, and the FCC to stand up to these unjust companies on our collective behalf.

525,"In November 2014, I placed a call to Comcast to report that my invoice was not transparent and continued increasing well beyond the initial agreed upon amount. A representative advised that in order to decrease billing I needed to add phone service to the bundle. I agreed to do this, but stated I would not use the phone service. The representative stated my monthly bill would be $142.99 moving forward. Several months later, I noticed that my bill is $206.00 monthly on average and not the previously agreed upon amount. Upon calling Comcast, I was told that the previously representative in November had not applied the program correctly resulting in the higher charges and that Comcast would not credit my future bills for the overpaid amounts nor will they apply the lower amount for future or current bills. After escalating the problem to a supervisor, I was still denied a credit for the agreed upon amount a Comcast representative offered to me.

 requesting assistance with lowering current cable package. The customer accepted a (12) month
 $99.00 Triple play Starter bundle with monthly rate $142.94. However, there were additional a la

 Please call Comcast at phone number 770-559-7111."
526,"I called Comcast about my current billing and asked about when my current promotion would end and what the the new pricing would be. Two different Comcast representatives told me my bill would not go up until September 2015 and that I could decide if I wanted to pay the new pricing come September, change my plan or cancel.
 However, My bill due July 3rd 2015 jumped up to the new price, which was a jump of over $20+ and when I called there was nothing they could do because the Comcast rep said that the computer reverted to the new pricing because my promotion ended in June 2015.
 I was misled by Comcast because I was told by two different reps that I had until September 2015. Yet when I called about the price jump, the rep said there was nothing they could do and I think that this was false advertising and unfair business practices. How could the Comcast rep not do anything to help me and solve this issue. I feel that Comcast just STOLE money from me by misleading me about my bill. I hope the FCC can do something about Comcast and all cable/internet providers about their false advertising and unfair business practices that hurt consumers.

527,"When I started new service, I opted to have a self-install kit which was suppose to be free. I was unable to install the kit because the previous tenant had disconnected a cable within the walls. Obviously, this is not an issue I could have fixed or foreseen. I called Comcast and they said that a installer would come FREE of charge to help with the issue. Once the installer came, he asked if I accepted the installation fee. I said no, because Comcast said it would be free. He said, he only gets paid when I accept the charge. I said that he can say whatever he wants, but that I would dispute the issue with Comcast. He was making me feel guilty for not wanting to accept the charge. I called Comcast and they said that they never agreed that the installation fee would be waived and they went ahead and charged me the $40. They said I could debate this charge with my landlord. I find these practices to be deceitful and I feel cheated by this company. I was forced to pay this amount, which they claimed would be waived.
 The fact that the previous tenant disconnected a cable within the walls was not my fault, nor was it theres. But I don't believe that as a customer, I should have to assume that financial responsibility. Especially because they're a huge corporation and I am a full-time student.

528,"I presently have 5 Comcast Internet service installations on hold due to landlords not agreeing to Comcast's ""Access to Property"" blanket document. Comcast wants no restriction, unfettered access, ability to construct and or destruct and an unending right to property they don’t own. Comcast has refused to accept versions of the document modified by landlords. As a result, Comcast has put all my installations on hold, even two where the landlords have agreed to their document. I feel we are being denied access to broadband speeds available by no other provider at these 5 locations.

530,"Dear Sir or Madame,
 I am writing you to see if you can help me with a fair resolution to a problem with me leaving Comcast.
 I signed up with Comcast Business Class for phone and high speed internet in Jan 2013. My account number was . You will find that I have had an impeccable payment record with your company.
 Due to inconsistent phone service (we were without phone service to my dental office for total of 7 whole days during the 2 year period). When I signed up with Comcast Business Class, I was assured the service was very reliable (99.95% up time was quoted to me) and the equipment contained battery backups to keep things going even when the power went out. I had been in business for 30+ years before this 2 year period and had only been without phone service for 2 hours over 30 years before signing the 2 year contract with Comcast. I had called and talked with the Comcast Business Class people in Dec 2014 and they told me to wait until the contract was up to make the transfer. The contract was up on Jan. 27, 2015. I made arrangements with my old carrier and service was transferred back over on Jan 28, 2015.
 After the service was transferred over that day, I called back Comcast Business Class people, as they had asked me to do. I canceled my service with them, (Ticket # CR432450849) and since we no longer have a Comcast office in our hometown, he advised me that I had to take the modem and the router to 303 E Fairlawn, Urbana, IL 61801. Tel #866-594-1234. This is about 30 miles from here, but my wife returned pieces of equipment and associated wires and connectors to there location the next business day. (60 mile round trip). He told me we would get 1 final bill for the partial month. A bill arrived about a week later and we paid it in full. I thought all was taken care of and all was good.
 A month later, we got another bill for service and equipment rental (which we had returned and had not been using for over a month). We called Comcast and were told that we had not filled out the proper forms to discontinue service and were going to have to continue paying for another 2 months. They sent me discontinuation paperwork, which I filled out and returned that day. The person I talked to was totally unsympathetic with my plight and told me ""so sad, too bad. I did ask to talk to her supervisor, which I did and she told me that she would try to resolve this in my favor. I never heard back from anyone, and then got another bill the next month. (b) (6)
 The 2 gentleman from Comcast Business Class in Dec 2014 and Jan 28, 2015 had said nothing at anytime about needing to submit any forms or paperwork, or I would have done that clear back in Dec 2014 when I initially talked to them about my intentions to transfer service.
 As it stands now, I am being asked to pay out over $200 (3 months of unused and unwanted) for service that I never used. I only had a 2 year contract and honored it to the bitter end even though the poor telephone service caused my business to loose many thousand of dollars due the seven days of no phone service during the 2 year contract. I am now being asked to pay for a time period beyond my contract when I had gone through all what I thought were the proper channels and actions.
 I am writing you as a final nice action to try to resolve this in a nice and fair way. I ask that you stop the hounding bills that I am receiving and that you refund my payments for anything paid for service or equipment rental past the Jan 28, 2015 disconnect day.
 I will take this to several state and federal government oversight agencies if we don't come to a fair resolution of this in the next 10 days.
 I don't want to damage my credit rating and can imagine what will happen if I don't pay this in a timely fashion.
 Thank you for your time and attention,

531,"upon signing up for Comcast service we were told that we would have the self-service equipment shipped out to us as priority mail. We did not receive the equipment until one week (7 days) later. When I told my wife to call the customer service line and let them know our displeasure the Comcast representative offered us a $30 dollar credit to our account. More than a week later and we still did not receive the credit, my wife contacted Comcast customer service via online chat and was told that our credit was not valid but was offered a $20 dollar credit. I feel that this is fraudulent because we were offered one thing and than once we never received what we were expecting we were forced to take a lesser deal.

534,"about a month ago I visited the Xfinity Comcast store in 4571 Sheridan St., Hollywood, FL to replace
 my broken modem. The woman helping me suggested I get their alarm service. i explained I was
 using ADT for $39 per month; she offered me Free installation and to ""take over using the same
 equipment."" Even had installation available in 2 days on Sunday. I agreed. The rest amounted to
 many problems, including a bill of $1,200 today. I;ve spent long hours on the phone with Comcast.
 I've been told that the bill was so high because two of my electronic bank payments were returned to
 Comcast. I printed my bank statements, called back Comcast, who then confirmed they gave me
 wrong information and took a payment of $438 OVER THE PHONE - I said ""make sure that's the total
 owed!"" I called back an hour later to confirm, and I was told something completely different! My
 regular bill is approximately $139 for TV and total with Internet of $289 I'm told. Now they took my
 $438 and still expect a balance of $792 - this is not the original Sales Pitch to take over ADT alarm
 service with Free Installation as their TV Commercials advertise."

I keep records of all bills, agreements, and such, and I was told when I last changed my plan that it was not a promotion. I was told by the Comcast representative ""Sorry about that, but even if that is true, I cannot change it now.""
 Basically they just raised my bill by $30 for no reason whatsoever, and I cannot do anything about it other than cancel. However, since Comcast is the only provider in the area of internet speeds that I need for my work, I am effectively left with no option but to put up with them doing whatever they want with my bill, however illegal it may be.

541,"In early March 2015, I signed up for Comcast's 105 Mbps Extreme internet plan. I was told that this plan did not have the data cap that is associated with some of Comcast's other plans. Based in part on the lack of a cap, the sales agent enticed me to sign up for this plan. Comcast now claims there is a data cap on the account and that it will be charging me for any data usage above the cap. I've reached out to Comcast multiple times about this issue. They claimed that they were going to pull the telephone call where I was promised a plan with no cap, but they have not followed up on this. Each time I speak to a representative at the company about the issue, they act as though they have no authority to deal with it. They have twice attempted to let me leave messages for supervisors, but each time the line went dead after the representative attempted to transfer me to the supervisor's voicemail box. Eventually I was promised that a supervisor would call me back about the issue, but this too has not happened. I have literally spent hours trying to get this issue resolved, and the resolution is quite simple. Comcast just needs to pull the call where I was promised no data cap, verify that the sales representative made that promise, and then remove the cap from my account. That call occurred on either 3/2/15 or 3/3/15. The resolution I seek is to have Comcast remove the cap, but it also seems appropriate that they would somehow compensate me for all the time I've invested in trying to fix their mistake, so far to no avail. Please contact me with any questions or if you need additional details. I can identify specific dates when I contacted Comcast about this issue, and I also have some online chat records related to this issue. Best regards,

542,"Comcast has a monthly 300GB data cap for its customers. I work with large media files for a living
 (visual assets for an animated television show) and use dropbox to transfer files back and forth with
 ease. These data caps are making it more expensive to do my job from home and from the office. I
 know that the law currently allows companies to do this, but I feel strongly that data caps should not
 be allowed. It costs the company a negligible amount of money to allow a larger or unlimited amount
 of data per month, and their capitalization on data usage is affecting my income and professional life.

 it's been almost 2.5 years with this trial and the citizens, especially me, of Atlanta, are frustrated that
 other parts of the country with the same company can use the internet freely while we have to monitor
 our usage and be charged if we go over. I think it is absolutely mad that this is happening and I

547,"This complaint is regarding Comcast account #
 That broadband/internet connectivity is now a public utility is a fact of life. A prolonged outage and inability of the provider to provide resolution in timely and easy manner can affect consumer's personal and professional life significantly. Keeping this in mind as context, here is my recent experience with Comcast. I hope the Commission finds it as appalling, frustrating and unacceptable as I did.
 I lost my internet access on Tuesday, June 23 and called Comcast service number. After going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine with the service rep I was told a tech visit would be scheduled for Monday, June 29. That is 7 days of internet outage - for a service that is akin to public utility nowadays! I told the rep that I work from home and this would cause great hardship to me. I was told there was nothing she could do and that I would just have to wait.
 I called Comcast support again on Wednesday, June 24. This time I had a more friendly rep who informed me (after going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine) that Comcast had a 3 day policy to fix an internet outage and it was unacceptable for me to have to wait 7 days to get my service back. She escalated my issue (ticket number CR461446459) and said someone from dispatch would call me by the end of day the same day to schedule a tech visit. I did not get that call. However, I did get a call from Comcast's Indian call center - advance tech support or such - to troubleshoot and we again went through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine (and only that) to no avail. This person too told me I will have to wait until Monday, June 29.
 I called Comcast support this morning, June 25, 2014, to check on dispatch status. I was told by the rep that a ""tech had been found"" and I would be hearing from dispatch in an hour or so (ticket # CR476463709). That was about 5 hours ago, and nothing so far.
 I just called the Comcast support again. Most annoyingly, this rep again insisted on going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine. This is a classic definition of insanity albeit institutional in this case - doing same things over and over again and expecting a different result. I had to escalate the matter this time to talk to a supervisor who told me he will get someone to my house soon but cannot give me a time.
 This is unacceptable. My internet is now down for the fourth day. My personal and professional life is at near standstill. All Comcast reps can do is to follow their ""boot your modem"" fetish and waste everyone's, including theirs, time. I need a tech to come asap and fix my internet access. An internet (b) (6)

549,"I am a Comcast customer with TV, internet and home security. For the last approximately 6 months I am being billed $10/month for a modem lease when I own my own equipment. I have called 3 times previously and have been told that the problem is fixed and the charge will no longer be billed, the most recent on March 6, 2015 when Ticket #027815145 was opened and supposed to resolve the issue. Each time the bill continues to show the $10 modem lease fee including on my April 4, 2015 bill. I called today, April 20, to customer service and each time I got close to speaking to a representative through the menu system I was told that ""We are unable to complete this call at this time"".
 The modem in question that I am being charged for has been determined to be the modem for my home security system, the lease cost of which is included in the monthly fee for home security. I am being billed twice for it. My modem for internet access is owned by me, not leased.
 Any help with what I believe to be fradulent billing would be appreciated. Thank you,

550,"On May 15th I called Comcast to report outages in my area, affecting me and a neighbor ten houses
 away. The outages lasted from one to several hours. The Comcast representative, Shirlene,
 informed a technician would be sent to the area though she had trouble understanding it was not just
 me. Shirlene provisioned my modem (I don't know what that means) as she said it had never been
 done.
 I lease my modem from Comcast and this modem is an upgrade installed on 9/9/2014 due to a
 Comcast bulletin. This modem provides WIFI service as well, necessary for smartphone updates and
 tablet computer use.
 Shirlene informed me that I was eligible for a promotional speed upgrade from 25 megabits per
 second to 50 megabits per second at no additional charge as I was coming out of my current
 promotional period (quite coincidental). I made sure it would cost me no additional money per month
 and it would not affect my television Internet package at all. Shirlene assured me it would not affect
 my television Internet plan or cost me any additional money.
 As of 5/15 my smartphone and tablet could no longer connect via WIFI. I received three
 ""confirmation e-mails"" of my new service with monthly billings ranging from $180 to $275, far in
 excess of the $163 on my May 2015 billing statement.
 After posting this complaint on the Xfinity Facebook page and stating I would file complaints with my
 state's Attorney General's office, the FCC, and the FTC, Comcast scheduled an appointment on 5/28.
 The technician and eventually his supervisor were here for 3.5 hours. Xfinity informed that the
 excess billing was due to Shirlene adding telephone service to my monthly plan which I did not
 authorize.
 The entire episode was a waste of my time in having to dedicate one-half day plus to trying to
 uncover the cryptic nature of the Comcast ""confirmation e-mails"" and why I was being charged so
 much and to discover the deception in my being slammed with a service I never requested.
 To-date I don't know if the fourth ""confirmation e-mail"" from Comcast of the ""final"" billing amount will
 be applied going forward, or how long it will last, but the promotional period as Shirlene promised me
 was 24 months and only 12 months is indicated in this confirmation e-mail...another deception."

This time I said I wanted an agent based in the US whose primary language was English. This guy kept giving me the run around telling me he could handle it. His English was not good and I was not up for any more communication issues, I'm sick of this problem. Every time I asked for a US agent, he answered me with why I should let him do it and then finally said, ""I'll get you my supervisor, but I can't tell you the supervisor will be in the US"". I thought US companies had to provide US based help when requested by the customer. Why was I refused an American to assist me?

 Thank you for your submission. Your complaint provides the FCC with important information we can use to develop policies to protect consumers, remedy violations of the Communications Act, and encourage future compliance with the law.

558,"I signed an agreement with Comcast for 2 years of Home Security Services. The service has been totally unreliable and required multiple service calls and equipment changes to no avail. The system has been unreliable and loses connection on a regular basis and has to be reset or requires technical support to resume monitoring. On the last attempt to repair the system I was advised there was an unusual situation with my home and the security system was destined to fail. It was at that time that I cancelled the contract and Comcast is now charging an early termination fee even though they are unable to fulfill their commitment in providing service. Multiple attempts to resolve this issue have been unsuccessful and tremendously time consuming. My justification for early termination was Comcast's inability to provide the services I was being charged for. They are unwilling to remedy the dispute and offer no alternatives. It is virtually impossible to communicate with anyone of authority because they will defer from one representative to another after long periods of being placed on hold. I have attempted to resolve this issue to no avail and Comcast has offered no solutions, therefore, I am either paying a $600 cancellation fee or essentially paying for a service that is not being provided as per the signed agreement.

559,"To Whom It Concerns:
 In September of 2014 I opened an account with Comcast for Internet services. I found a promotional deal on their own website for 50Mbps Internet ""Blast"". I signed up after I had to argue that the deal was indeed advertised on Comcast. Once I had my account opened everything was okay up until I moved. In April of 2015 I moved to an address that still supports Comcast Internet. It is widely advertised online and TV commercials that moving your services with Comcast will be the ""easiest"" part of your move.
 However, once I contacted Comcast and notified them I was moving from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Delary Beach, Florida I was told that I could NOT move my services. The easiest option was to close my original account (account # ) and open a new account, with a new account number. I thought this would be easy enough. The representative said that I could still get the same package as before but that my rate of $39.99 a month would not be an option to keep. I was forced to pay $49.99 a month for the same services just because I moved to another city in Florida about 20-30 minutes away. I did not believe this was a fair practice but my only other option if I wanted to pay the same rate of $39.99 was to add Cable TV to my plan. I did not want to include Cable TV as part of my package. I did not want to bundle and pay for a service that I would not use.
 So for the same amount of service I have to pay an additional 10 dollars a month or I must add more services that I do not want. Then after 12 months Comcast would increase my bill even more. I do not find this to be in the best interest of subscribers to Comcast. I have been very unhappy with Comcast and the level of service and how they are able to charge whatever amount they want because I have no other option than to argue with Comcast or just give in to their unfair billing practices.
 Sincerely,

560,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

Once we finally were able to get into our account to pay the bill there was a security question that we never set up with a ridiculously long password for it that we believe they set up considering that we never once made a security code with them or the codes subject. When we talked to this lady over the phone she was extremely rude asking us to explain our situation to her but kept cutting us off.

566,"This is my second formal complaint about the same issue:
 I recently filed a complaint with the FCC, Thank you for reaching out to Comcast, I am afraid that the
 result was less than acceptable and it seems to me that they are being quite aggressive. I do hope
 this is not as a result of me reaching out to you. A Ms. Hamner, executive guest relations did reach
 out to me, but was completely unable to resolve the issue, infact she was under the impression that I
 had not cancelled my account, which I had, and that I had not returned by equipment and said If I do
 not return it she will charge me for it.... I had returned it. so many examples of them not knowing
 what is going on. They continue to threaten to charge me the cancellation fee, which I will not, this is
 going to affect my credit rating which will be extremely unethical of this company... below see a recent
 posting I have made via email to one of their managers...
 Zach,
 I am terribly frustrated with your organization. I recently cancelled your service due to the fact that
 you were not able to provide a solid internet line, and I was continuously having TV signal issues.
 After some investigation and not getting any replies, no shows from your technicians, I finally had to
 go to the FCC. Then I got a response from one of your account executives, Ms Lindsay Hamner, who
 replied to me a couple of times and there after refuses. What I was asking for was the cancellation
 fee to be waived, given that the service I was receiving was so poor I was using my cell phone to gain
 internet access:
 1. I have called many, many times and spent literally hours on the phone with your agents. On many
 occasions I was told you were not able to access my account to make the changes I needed,
 2. I Called for technicians and was given appointment times, and had no shows,
 3. I did have one tech come out who was not able to resolve the situation but told me to call to get a
 supervisor tech. I did.
 4. Your company offered again to send a technician, and I declined this and said its been months and
 I am still waiting and just want to cancel and move to Direct TV.
 5. I cancelled effective April 1,
 6. I called to cancel and it was cancelled, so they said, (after a wait of about 45 min),
 7. I was told someone would come to collect the equipment at a certain time,
 8. I took off work to wait for the person to pick it up,
 9. They did not arrive
 10. I called again and was told its easier to just drop it off at the service center, to which I answered I
 would have done that in the first place if someone would have let me know,
 11. I immediately went to your store in Denver to return the equipment. When I arrived I was told by
 the person at the counter that there was something wrong with my account, and he could not receive,
 check in the equipment, I said I need an official receipt. He called a supervisor who was not able to
 properly access my account, (something about a telephone issue?) I have photos of the screen to
 post on to the blog. After 75 min, they finally said they will have to write out a hand written receipt,
 and gave that to me. I knew immediately this was going to be a disaster, I had no choice but to
 accept it and hope for the best
 12.In reaction to me FCC complaint I received a very cold note from Ms. Lindsay Hamner, basically
 informing me that I am at fault and that they were not goint to waive the cancellation fee. She stated
 that if I do ever cancel I will be required to pay for the cancellation fee and if I dont return the
 equipment I will be charged in full for this, she also claimed I only called 2 times and thus its really my
 fault (Not quoted, but her message),
 13. Well the interesting thing is I had cancelled a month ago and returned all the equipment as above.
 14. So at this stage, you had charged me another month and not cancelled the account, nor did you
 have any record that I had returned the equipment.
 15. I told Ms. Hamner this, and she replied that she had had the account cancelled now and that I will
 still need to pay the cxl fee as I signed a contract ? Well this is terrible, i signed a contract, you did
 not provide the service, I cancelled, you did not cancel., I dropped the equipment off, you were not
 able to access my account, I was told by your executive customer relations that if i cancel in the
 future I will be charged a cxl fee and if i fail to return the equipment i will be charged for that, and I
 had already done all this.
 16. I have sent several messages since including leaving a voice mail.
 17 I have asked her to put me intouch with her boss, no reply from her.
 18. I have never been given an apology, just extremely hostile notes, I resent the implication that I
 would not return the equipment, I resent the inability for you to accept my equipment and I had to sit
 for over an hour only to get a hand written piece of paper,
 19. I sent all the photos to Ms. Hamner and she still claimed i will be charged, basically I am at fault.
 20. I am going to go back to the FCC,
 21. Frankly its only about $400 and it is no big deal to pay for it, in fact it would have been less
 expensive than the time I have taken to resolve this issue, but its the ethics of the matter. I can not
 believe that an organizatoin with such a lack of regard for ethical business practices is in business.
 I do expect htis issue to be resolved and I do expect to speak to someone who this Ms. Hamner
 reports to.
 Please help.
 Thanks

567,"I signed up for a plan with 105 Mbps download speed, and opted to do the self-install package,
 which they promptly sent. However, the cable was disconnected at the top of the telephone poll (I
 could see where it was disconnected), so I called to have a serviceman re-connect it. I made it clear
 that the issue was with Comcast's cable, and unless they wanted me to climb the telephone poll
 myself, they would have to send someone to do it.
 - When the serviceman came, he wanted to come into the house to connect the cable, and I
 explained that I needed him to go connect it outside on the telephone poll. He seemed confused, and
 I found out that the work-order that was created turned out to be for a full installation - which includes
 a $75 charge. I told him that I just needed the line to be hot, and when he connected it, the internet
 light turned on on my modem, and I was good to go. But he still wanted to complete the Activation. I
 told him that I'm using my own modem and router, both of which are top-of-the-line, and more than
 capable of through-putting 105Mbps (Router handles up to 300Mbps, Modem handles up to 172Mbps
 - both are the latest model). He went back outside and disconnected one of the cable links on the
 side of the house, then came back to my front door and said he needed to look at my setup. I asked
 him what he had disconnected, and went to look on the side of my house, and he full-on sprinted to
 the side of my house to beat me there, and quickly began reconnecting what he had disconnected.
 He said he made a mistake, when he obviously disconnected a cable to gain access to my house to
 charge me for a full activation. I could not believe it. He was caught in a lie, and was very apologetic.
 I had him call his dispatcher, and that I wanted to speak to her. I told her what happened, and she
 said that the work order was for a full activation. I told her that was wrong, and that I just needed him
 to make the line hot, and that I'm good to go now. She promptly told the serviceman to leave, and he
 did.
 - Upon activating my connection, I immediately did a speed-test, with the representative on the line.
 My speeds reached 50Mbps - no more. I asked why I wasn't getting 105mbps, she directed me to the
 Comcast website speed test where the numbers showed higher than speedtest.net, yet still under the
 promised 150mbps. She asked me to reset my box so she could ""check"" something, upon reboot, my
 speedtest.net results showed 80mbps. She said it's the ""best they could do"" even after I reminded her
 I'm paying for 105mbps. Again, I was using a modem and router capable of MUCH higher through-put
 than 105Mbps, and I was sitting less than 4ft from the router (using the latest retina Macbook Pro).
 She said that if I find that my speeds are substantially less a week later, they could put a ""booster"" or
 something on my line. Not sure what this does exactly, but I decided to continue monitoring my
 speeds each day for a week.
 - After 3 days, my connection was topping out at 18Mbps, averaging at around 15Mbps. Again - I
 was paying for 105Mbps.
 - One week after the mentioned Mbps conversation was had, I called Comcast to see what they could
 do about my service. I was on the phone with a representative for 45 minutes asking why I'm not
 getting the internet I was promised, and how I could get anything close to that - making it clear that I
 would be happy with anything over 50Mbps at this point. He had no resolution for me, downplaying
 the effectiveness of the aforementioned ""booster"" and offering various actions I could try, one of
 which was disconnecting the coax cable from the wall and the modem, and flipping it (wall-side to the
 modem, and vice-versa). I literally laughed out loud when he said this. He ended up saying that the
 low speeds were attributed to the fact that I was using 3rd-party hardware (modem and router), and
 that I should contact the manufacturer. Even when I assured him that my hardware was much better
 than what Comcast would have rented me (for $10/mo), he said that the problem was probably my
 hardware. I finally told him that I would do a power-cycle, and when I turned everything back on, lo
 and behold, the speeds were back up to 81Mbps down, and 12Mbps up. I told him that these speeds
 were acceptable, and that I would continue to monitor to make sure they don't go down again.
 ===
 I am angered by Comcast hiring unethical employees who will disconnect a cable on the side of my
 house, to complete a faulty work-order, and thus charge me for a service I did not need or ask for. I
 am angered by Comcast for claiming to provide much higher speeds then they actually can deliver. I
 am a UI designer, contracting for 3 companies, working an average of 15 hours a day. I am shocked
 that I have had to go through such a headache to get decent internet service from Comcast. I can't
 imagine how many people are getting much lower speeds then they think they are, and who are
 paying all sorts of extra fees simply because they trust Comcast to deliver what they say they will.
 The reality is, unless you watch them like a hawk, and confirm and test everything, you will most likely
 be ripped off in one way or another. It is shameful that Comcast allows these types of practices to be
 a standard."
568,"I sign up for a year deal. They told me I'm sorry don't know what happened and they raised my
 monthly fee, then they told me that they were repackaging me with a higher price but better internet
 speed, then that said well you will be paying more at the same speed sorry for the person that lied to
 you."
569,"I am paying for an internet and HBO subscription. I only use my PS3 to watch tv via Hulu, Netflix, etc. I just switched to comcast and now I cannot utilize HBO Go, yet I am paying for the service. How can I use what I am paying for if Comcast will not allow me to?

571,"Between April 14, 2015 and until last week, my internet would go out at least once a week and would be out for an entire day or two. Each ti9me Comcast said it wasn't their fault. After my service was out for 5 days I complained to Comcast / Xfinity customer services again. I was told they would finally bring a technician over without charge. I received my bill and the $70 charge is there. I called Comcast, and they now refuse to waive the fee claiming I don't have some protection plan they offer (which was never mentioned to me previously). This company lies. Plain and simple. When you call them to look up notes or recordings of conversations you had with their agents, they conveniently can't locate the conversations or notes.

573,"Hello,
 Not sure if this falls into ""Speed"" or ""Interference"" but here goes.
 I have called Comcast multiple times regarding my internet connection dropping once a day the past month and a half and more recently twice a day this past week. Prior to the internet connection dropping everything was working fine and I haven't changed anything at all but all of a sudden my modem would state that it's connected but no connection would come through (confirmed this with a Comcast Technical support representative) so Comcast sent a Technician two weeks ago.
 Everything in my house wires, modem, cables are fine which the technician explained and went to check outside. He stated that he did something (didn't explain what exactly only to send a new signal) and hoped it wouldn't happen again (now this isn't very reassuring) he seemed dumbfounded by the situation and the explanation he gave me was ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"". Now this technician is a nice guy he tried to help me out but what upset me the most is, NO, this does not happen in apartments because prior to this month and a half of internet difficulty my service was nothing but exceptional for just over a year or so that I've been with Comcast. To me ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"" is an excuse and a poor one, he shouldn't be hopeful but factual.
 Now I really did hope that would fix the issue, but guess what? I did not. At all, made things a bit worse. Internet connection started dropping now twice a day which is frustrating having to power cycle my modem twice a day when I'm in the middle of something.
 I called Comcast tech support again to explain the situation and this gentleman looked into my modem signal log/history to see what's up and saw that my signal was just at the ""borderline of coming and going connections"" so I asked him ""What can we do here to fix this?"" the tech support said ""I can't do anything on this end""
 I really want this issue fixed as soon as possible. I am also confused about it since for over a year of service I've had with Comcast my connection never dropped every day like how it's been doing for the past month and a half.

574,"My internet and Cable went down. I called Comcast and they said they would have to send a tech. They send a tech. He laughs and says ""I can't believe they didn't cut off your service. The line coming to your house is an older type cable and needs to be replaced. I say ok. So all in all, the tech replaces Comcast wiring and our service is restored. Later I get a bill, for $70 service call. I call in and request it be waived since the issue was with Comcast's equipment (wires) and not internal wiring or equipment. The first customer service person is not helpful and will not remove fee. I ask for manager and after much discussion and many attempts to get me to buy some sort of service plan for a $4.95 monthly fee, she finally says. ""The computer will not let me fix this"" The only way I can remove the fee is if you pay us the monthly fee going forward. And if you cancel the service agreement before 3 months has passed, the charge will go back on"". She also states that even though she is in the ""escalation dept"" That the computer has been programed to NOT allow her to waive the fee unless a customer signs up for the service agreement and associated fee. I refused. I was not going to be blackmailed into signing up for a service and paying a fee just to get a bogus service call fee removed. Since it was clear that Comcast executive management chose not to even give their customer service people the ability to fix this issue, I decided to write the FCC. I would imagine that literally thousands of people each day are getting these bogus fees on their bill. Some just pay them without knowing it because they are auto pay; some do notice and call in like me... and get nowhere... or worse are forced to pay for a monthly service agreement. And Comcast wonders why they rank at the bottom in customer satisfaction?? So here I am, 2 hours into my attempts to resolve this issue. What a waste of time and effort. I would like a bill credit for not only the bogus service call fee; but also my time . $500 should cover it.

I decided to take the modem home and try it contingent on the representative stating to me directly that I could return the modem if I didn't use the service and would not be charged a penny. I told the representative that Century Link was going to increase the speed of my internet and that if it didn't work I would use Comcast. I took the modem home but I NEVER used it. I never used my Comcast for one single moment. I went into the Comcast center because they were billing me and the representative told me that a manager would call me because he wasn't able to take my modem back and issue a credit. He also told me that Comcast could not check if I ever used the service. When I asked for a manager the representative in the store told me that one was not available and it was mid day. I insisted that someone address the issue and he told me that a manager would contact me. A manager NEVER contacted me. Then Comcast had a third party service named Complete Recovery Corporation contact me. I spoke with Steven May and told him that I never had Comcast service and I was more than happy to return the modem but I needed my account to be cleared. I made several calls to Comcast to try to correct this and went into the service center more than once. I finally gave up because a manager NEVER contacted me as promised. Then last week I discovered that Comcast has placed my account with a collection agency and the collection agency has already reported the account to the credit bureau without contacting me. I discovered this when it was brought to my attention as I was applying for credit. Comcast also placed a hard inquiry on my credit file and they never asked me or disclosed to me that they were going to check my credit. I never used the service with Comcast. I was promised I could return the modem if I never used the service and not be charged. The representative at the service center refused to allow me to talk to management. Management never called me. Comcast did not resolve the issue when I contacted them over one dozen times about this.

583,"On May 15, 2015, I contacted Comcast customer service to set up a newly purchased modem on my
 account. The representative I spoke with that day noted that they would no longer charge us for a
 modem rental going forward. I asked her to look further into it, because I have never rented a modem
 from Comcast. She researched the issue and informed me that the billing error had been occurring
 since November 2009. She created a ticket to have the error corrected and our account adjusted
 (Ref# 029052678) and said we should call back in 5 business days.
 On May 26, 2015, 6 business days later, I followed up on the status of the request with Comcast
 customer service. The representative, Marcus, repeatedly denied that they would be able to confirm
 whether the error had occurred for that length of time, as their records ""only go back one year,"" which
 is completely inconsistent with what the representative I spoke with on 5/15 told me. Marcus also
 informed me that they would be refunding me for one month, or $6.45, of the overpayments, because
 it is my responsibility to verify that their billing is accurate. At that point, I asked to speak with a
 supervisor.
 When I finally reached a supervisor, I authorized my husband to continue the conversation. The
 supervisor refused to identify himself by name to my husband, and when my husband explained the
 issue and asked that we be made whole, the supervisor responded that two months would be the
 maximum refund they would offer and stated that it is our responsibility to verify the correctness of
 their billing practices.
 We have been on an automatic payment plan with Comcast for several years, and never noticed a
 significant enough change to warrant further investigation, hence our failure to review the bill
 thoroughly. However, we have always expected Comcast to act in good faith and bill us only for
 services that were provided, and not for those services they have not provided.
 Also, in reviewing their bill dated 4/21/2015 (see attached), I believe that their billing statements are
 intentionally deceptive. On page 1, the bill states that we pay $76.95 for our service and $0.70 in
 taxes for a total of $77.65. If I were to review my bill, I would see that page and assume that $76.95 is
 the cost of the cable internet service only. However, when I review the second page, that service total
 is $66.95 for the service itself and $10 for the modem rental. It stands to reason that reasonable
 individuals who review their bill on a regular basis might easily miss a charge such as this.
 Additionally, we note that their refund of $6.45 per month falls far short of the $10 that has been
 billed. At 66 months, $6.45 per month would amount to an overpayment of $425.70; $10 amounts to
 $660. The difference is very material to the average consumer.
 Please take action on this complaint and ask Comcast to make us whole. We aren't seeking anything
 more than we have overpaid them over the last five-and-a-half years, only the excess amount paid for
 services not received.
 Sincerely,
 (b) (6)"
584,"I recently was reviewing my 80 year-old mother's bills and noticed that her Comcast bill included modem rental. I asked her why she was renting a modem when you can buy them at Best Buy, Walmart, etc. She told me that when she called Comcast and asked why her bill was so high in 2014, they told her she could not purchase a modem that supported both a phone/internet connection.
 I called Comcast today and after 79 minutes on the phone and various representatives, I was told exactly the same thing by Curtis. I asked to speak to a supervisor when I was told that my mother had been renting a modem since 2011 for $10/month. Four years of fees to rent something she could have purchased herself but because she is a Senior Citizen, she believed what they told her. I have a batch number for my complaint #DUJO0411 and Comcast assured me that they will be in touch within 72 hours.
 I find this reprehensible behavior to lie to customers and tell them they need to rent items they could easily purchase in the store.

585,"On June 26, 2013 we have called to cancel our contract and were told about cancellation fees, however Customer Service representative offered to transfer existing service for the duration of the original contract (remaining 3 months). Nonetheless without disclosing the Representative renewed our contract for additional 24 months without our knowledge.
 Yet again on 10/22/2013 we called customer service and all we wanted to do at the time is to add Basic Cable TV. Yet again, we were misinformed as to what transpires when adding a basic service. We were absolutely not disclosed that adding simple TV service would renew/add secondary contract .
 Moreover, while discussing the matter after words with several different business customer service representatives we were informed that Comcast Business does not offer nor support Cable TV in the residential house under business account, therefore it was never supposed to be installed; furthermore, additional contract was executed.
 Based on arguments listed above we file for:
 1. DEFINITVE TERMINATION OF CONTRACT #1 (Id# 6474396) from June 2013 to expire June 2015 WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES AND FEES.
 2. Since we were never suppose to be provided with TV at the Residential House and were not disclosed that additional contract shall take affect we file for TERMINATION WITHOUT ANY FEES AND PENALTIES OF CONTRACT #2 (ID#6871464).

When a Comcast technician had not arrived by 7:15 pm I called. First the Comcast Rep said that I did not have an appointment, when I explained that a Comcast rep had personally called me and set it up the rep said I cancelled it. I am so frustrated with this nonsense Comcast is a multi billion dollar company and they can't straighten out my internet and on demand service. Comcast customer service sucks! It is bad enough that I sometimes have to struggle to understand what most of their customer service reps are saying. Is there anyway you can light a fire under them? All I want is to receive the services I am paying for. In this age of technology the internet is a necessity for me and my family and we are all very inconvenienced. I have already paid an extra $50.00 to Metro PCS for a hot spot connections in order to have the internet. HELP HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!! Please Please Please you are the only one who can.

588,"Back in December 2014 - Feb 2015, I had called complaining of unacceptable latency to first hop on
 the Comcast network and outages occurring many times daily which made it impossible to work from
 home. Comcast agreed to send a tech out and indicated that I would be charged if the issue was on
 my end. Contracted Techs were dispatched a number of times and didn't find issues at my house.
 Ultimately they escalated it to a Comcast Engineer who fixed the signal repeater near on a utility pole
 my house and indicated to me after his work that my area is severely oversubscribed and that there
 was a plan to split my neighborhood. His work on the Comcast Repeater on the utility pole helped
 quite a bit but latency is still high and I get periodic connection issues. Ping times to the first hop (my
 local comcast office in my city) are varied from 30 ms to 3000 ms depending on the time of day.
 I've called a number of times to dispute the $140 charge for the tech visits mostly without success. I
 did at one point talk to someone in tech support who was able to take $60 off my bill as that was the
 limit he could take off without referring the matter to a supervisor. I've called since then a number of
 times requesting the remainder be taken off. I've been told consistently that a supervisor needs to
 call me back but nobody ever does. It seems to me that that there are institutional barriers to
 resolving billing disputes and I haven't been able to get this resolved.
 In addition, I find the level of latency substandard, the service inconsistent and customer service rude
 and unhelpful and certainly not worth the $80 per month that I'm forced to pay this local monopoly for
 internet service. My neighbors and I all would very much like to see this issue resolved."
589,"My issues initiated when my service was moved from Westland, MI 48185 to my current address of , MI 48205 in Feb of 2015. The service account was not transferred but given an entire new account number. The customer service reps whom my wife and I have encountererd are been rude and in the least bit helpful. We were told that the automatic pay system was not working thus our account was disconnected; we were charged a $40 activation fee in May 2015. My wife made a payment over the phone and our account in May 2015 of $393. The automatic bill system took and additional $400 in May 2015 for May's payment. Our account now has been charged an additonal $400 for June payment. In total our account past due balance was $393 in whic was paid our account has been charged with automatic deductions a total of $900. We have called several times to find out when our bank account is accredited back the money and we have not yet received answers. The recent interaction we were told a manager would be calling and have not received any phone calls back we requested automatic pay to be cancelled in May but the account is still receiving deductions

When I called to dispute the charge, I was told that the charge was in error, but it took several more phone calls to actually get it removed from my bill.

594,"I have been with comcast since moving to the Dickson County, TN area in October of 2014. When we first signed up for Comcast we was told that our internet would be unlimited midmonth during our billing cycle we get a phone call telling us we have went over data allowance for the month. That the first 3 months that we wouldn't be charged and then three months later we get a bill for $300 saying we went over our data allowance. In the mean time we have changed things on our plan and are being charged a month in advance for each time we make changes never seeing what we paid for in advance for the prior time. Now, with that being said back to the unlimited data issue we change our plan and get more tv channels instead of using data to stream Netflix like we had been doing previously and they tell us that we can have faster internet with 100 more gigs of data. Then i get the phone call again we have went over data limits again and have not been streaming Netflix nor have we used the internet as much as we had in the prior months. So, I call Comcast and they say there is no such thing as a higher data package so now i have been lied to twice first saying we were getting unlimited data and then telling us there is no such thing as more data that all of their plans contain the same amount of data. I call several times to talk to someone about my concerns get connected to a supervisor and then i get hung up on once i discuss my issues with the supervisor. Our bill gets higher and higher every month with no rhyme nor reason of why. I am getting very discouraged and am not sure where to turn. I just feel like bills for $400 for cable and internet are a little absurd. If you need a tech to come to your house because something is wrong with your equipment you get charged an astronomical service call fee. I could just switch but then I'm under contract for a year.

 every hour or so. This prevented me from doing the neccasary work I need to do so that I would be
 able to pay comcast at all. Also, I was recieving billing statements that weren't exactly trustworthy.
 Low and behold I called comcast to understand both problems. They had me on hold for times up to 2
 hours each day I tried to solve the problem. They continued to say that it was my problem for the
 lackluster internet. So, I try and be patient and I do as I was told would solve the problem and bought
 a new cable modem that they said would solve the problem entirely. Again, didn't work. I was forced
 to call again and remain on hold for a period of 2 hours waiting for a supervisor. I was told once again
 that there was nothing they could do but reimburse me for the days I didn't have any internet...20$.
 Now this concerns me because at this point in time I have been without internet for over a week and
 have spent up to 10 hours over the span of a week trying to resolve this issue. I have been hung up
 on and spent valuable time during work trying to figure out the problem, only to be told I am the
 problem."

 Here are some photos of my internet speed that I had a few months ago compared to now.
 The first was back in March. The second, today. The speeds are way worse now, and often at odd hours the internet will be throttled down to very low speeds. This makes downloading almost impossible. My speeds on steam were at 10Mbps, and are now only 3-4Mbps.

 There are only 3 computers and a single TV connected to the internet most of the time (a fourth laptop when my nephew has homework or is visiting). Two of the users only use the internet to browse facebook, while I myself use it to play video games and watch movies. I use the internet from anywhere from 10am to 4am sometimes, and around 1-2 am the internet will be very very very bad sometimes with ping up to 20k-30k which makes playing games or watching movies impossible.

598,"Hello,
 I've had Comcast television, internet and phone service for almost one year now. Recently, I've
 had internet service outages consistently each day for multiple hours. I've called Comcast service
 every time my service goes out and have been told there is a ""severe outage"" in my area and that
 ""advanced technicians"" are working on the problem. This has occurred since April 28, 2015 to today
 which is May 6, 2015 (which as of right now still isn't fixed). The representative I contacted last night
 told me the outage should be resolved by 10:12 P.M. as of last night which was May 5, 2015. I check
 this morning and my service still isn't working and the out resolution date has been pushed back to
 3:00 P.M. today which is May 6, 2015. Now this is approximately the 7th time I've been told a
 resolution time and it has been pushed back. I pay over $150 a month for this service and I can't even
 use my own internet. The representatives have told me ""just use our Xfinity Hotspot coverage until we
 fix the issue."" And about 50% of the time their Xfinity Hotspot won't even work either. I've been hung
 up on, dusted off by multiple representatives just blaming my services on the ""severe outage."" I don't
 know what else to do. I'm fed up with Comcast. Most of the time, I can't even get a service technician
 out to my apartment for a minimum of 4 days. This issue has gotten worse instead of getting better.

 the outage."
599,"I moved out of the apartment I was living at in December 2014, and proceeded to disconnect my internet-only services from Comcast I had procured for that apartment the day after I moved out.
 My billing stop date (or so I was informed during the call when I requested the disconnect) was on December 11th, 2014, one day after I moved out of the apartment.
 I made a payment to my account at Comcast on December 24th, 2014 in the amount of $20.31. I did so because the due date was the next day, and I never received an amount for the pro-rated amount for the 11 days of internet services I received in December. The pro-rated amount came to be $3.23, thus an overpayment of $17.08 occurred.
 I contacted Comcast customer service in January 2015 and requested a refund check of the overpayment amount, and was told the following (verbatim): ""Refund checks are automatically generated 30 days after a customer’s hard disconnection date, not the stop bill date. You will receive your refund in the form of a check. It typically takes 4-6 weeks for the entire process to take place."" The hard disconnect date occurs a month after the billing stop date, and I believe my hard disconnect date occurred on 1/27/15.
 To date, I have not received any check or refund, and have had multiple inquiries into the status of the refund deflected over the last 4 months.

601,"My ISP, Comcast, forces me to purchase a bundle of services, including cable TV (which I do not object to) and telephone service (which I do object to) in order to receive bundle pricing. I do not want or need phone service (we all use cell phones and don't even have the ringer turned on on our home phone). By requiring this addition, not only am I forced to pay for a service that I don't need, but I also must pay an outrageous modem rental fee since I'm required to have a VOIP modem, and not just a cable modem that I could easily purchase for less than $100 on my own and avoid the rental fee altogether. In addition, the addition taxes and surcharges related to the telephone service could be eliminated as well.
 What I would like is to be able to drop the telephone service, obtain my own modem and return theirs (eliminating the modem rental fee), and have my package of TV and Internet reduced by a reasonable amount to reflect no telephone service.

604,"Downgraded my Cable and Internet service on 3/31/15 to Local channels only and 25 speed internet. At this time I paid Over $300 to pay my account in full so we could start our new service fresh. Comcast never credited my account for the one month ahead billing of $163.00 for the previous service. I called Comcast on 4/21/15 to ask them to upgrade my service to Blast internet speed as of 4/21/15. The Internet speed was not responding when they looked at my current modem due to my outdated modem so I was asked to purchase a new modem. I purchased a new modem on 4/21/15 at Best Buy. I set up the modem and contacted Comcast to send the signal and set up the new modem on my account. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Comcast with no solution. I was switched to 4 different representatives and placed on hold repeatedly. They are still trying to collect the $163 amount from me they are saying I still owe them and are not willing to send a new signal to my new modem until I pay for this bill. The $163 invoice is for my previous service of 200+ channels with HD and a DVR that I would have owed if I would have kept my 200+ channels. I returned all of the boxes to Comcast and switched to a $69.99 plan as of March 30th. I do not owe the $163.00 for April for the service I suspended on March 30th. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Comcast representatives last night to try to fix the billing issue only to be sent to another automated service that asked me again to pay a past due amount of $163.00. When I spoke with the billing department, the lady on I spoke with said she was uncertain as to why this is happening because my bill is current. This delay of internet has caused problems with my job. I am required to complete work from home and I am unable to remote into my employer to do this. I do not have a problem paying for the service that is being provided to me, but I should not be kept from my internet service when I am not past due on my account and because they are trying to collect more out of me than the service that is being provided to me. No one took the time to try to recalculate my new bill and service. All they were worried about was this amount that was showing up for $163.00 that I do not owe because it was for my previous service that if I would have kept, would have been owed for April. I canceled this service and it was never credited and now they are keeping my internet disconnected for this amount.

605,"I called to set up service with Comcast I wanted the date of May 26 at that time was advised that it would be best to move it to the date the computer would be here which would be May 29. On May 29 they where scheduled to come out at 12 and the tech arrived informing me he could not leave converter boxes because all tv's were not present, I informed tech I was never informed that this was a requirement any other time they turn the cable on and I hook the cable up myself and if there are any problems I call in and Comcast trouble shoots and sends a signal and all is well. I called Comcast because the tech said he did not have a number for me to call and after being transferred and disconnected they did verify that this is policy and there sorry I was miss informed but they could not leave the converter boxes, I after speaking with Comcast found the tech in my driveway smoking cigarettes and on a personal call talking about he didn't know I was ready he thought I was still on the phone. I told him I am done and you need to get busy so he told the person he had to call them back cause he was at a customers home. So since 1 tv was here and 1 computer I instructed the tech to hook those 2 up. The tech proceed to try to hook up the 2 then informs me that he had more bad news he can not find the wiring for the front 2 rooms and the lines are are not working and that I need to call a tech to run new cable lines as the home owner's association guidelines does not allow Comcast techs to do this service and that I would need to get this installation cancelled so the tech called in and ask me to cancel installation which I did. Now keep in mind I already took had took Friday off to have this done. I then took off Wed June 3 so the tech could come and run cable lines. The tech entered my premises and was able to find the cable line in less than 3 minutes and was able to tell me after his assessment and testing there was nothing wrong with the lines. I then called Comcast and informed them of the techs inaccuracy and that hiring a tech to do a job that Comcast should be able to provide does not sit well with me. A agent then informed me the earliest they could get me a New installation date would be June 16, I explained this is unacceptable for such poor service. The agent contacted his supervisor who told the agent he had to do a forced appointment for June 16 but would contact me before the close of business Thurs June 4 with an sooner appointment than June 16. I also went to Xfinity in York PA and asked to speak to a manager to file a complaint and was informed they were only the sales division and they would send a memo out to the installation dept informing them of what transpired and to see if they could get me a sooner appointment and she would contact me before close of business Thurs also. Unfortunate to say I did not hear back from either xfinity York Pa or the Supervisor so I called in to Comcast again I informed them that neither party responded back so was tranfered to installation who stated they could only do a forced appointment for June 10 between 12pm and 5pm since I had an appointment and I cancelled it, but I let them know I only cancelled because the tech instructed me too. I informed the tech that I have to be to work and can not accommodate that schedule the best I could do is to have the tech be here before 12 and be done by 2pm. Well sadly to say it's 12pm and no tech so I call in again and the tech informs me that they see the note but I am a squeeze in and when they get time they will get to me and there is nothing they can do. I have taken 1 day of work to have Comcast installed. Which
 didn't get done then I took another day off work because the Comcast tech said I needed to have 2 cable lines installed and had to hire a tech only to find out their is nothing wrong with the cable lines and now it is 1:30pm and still no tech and I won't get cable installed again cause I have to get back to work.

Which is unfair because if you have an issue they know that and don't want to help. I have complained several times about the internet being slow and cutting out which I have the medium grade service and they just act like that you have to buy the top of the line internet which is apparently according to them about $50-$70 a month which is ridiculous. To me we don't get good service and treated properly when we call in with an issue. Its always the TV's fault or Netflix fault but never their internet's fault.

However, I continue to be billed for services at the old service locations that I do not occupy for going on 5 months at an estimated cost of between $1165 and $1750.

 agreed on crediting me $50. While the payment was $10 each month for 11 months, which is $110.
 Another issue was I was paying too much and called Comcast asking for a representative when my
 deal ended and was charged $103 my internet service. That's when I contacted Comcast and got a
 discount after calling 3-4 times dealing with rude Customer Reps. I was finally given a deal for 60$
 when I was promised I would be given the same speed after I asked three -four times. I was
 reassured it would be same. That week the internet service was slow and I did a speed test it was 25
 mbps. That's when i took a look at my bill and saw they gave me the wrong plan with the wrong
 speed. I was given the internet plus 25 plan which is clearly the 25 mbps plan. I gave a call again to
 Comcast and explained their mistakes. Again i had to deal with different customer reps, they
 accepted their mistakes. Even though they accepted their mistakes, I was told i would have to pay
 $10 more for the super blast speed of 105 mbps which I was promised. After contacting several
 people at Comcast, I agreed to paying more because everything is connected to my internet. For
 example my phone plan and my tv service. I gave them a call today because the speed was still
 under 25 mbps. I went through all the steps the customer rep told me and found out it was a issue
 with my router. That's when I decided I would get a new router and a modem. Previously I was paying
 for a modem Comcast provided me. When I asked the customer rep that I would surely by given $10
 off my bill if I bought my own modem. He clearly told me no because he stated that I was using my
 own modem, when I clearly was not. When I was given a discount on my plan. The modem fee was
 taken off and it didnt appear on my bill, so i am guessing he thought I was using my own modem. I
 kept telling him 5-6 times in a nice tone. He on the other hand started yelling at me. I even told him he
 can have the Comcast people come out to my house and see the modem I am using is theirs. It
 clearly states Comcast underneath. After that he stated I could use my own and take that to the
 Comcast store and I would be given extra $10 off, so my bill would be $50 instead of $60. His name
 was Alex V. His customer rep id was alex v.
 id GNOPEN RACKET and was speaking from the PHILLIPEANS. That is when I took a look at my
 previous bills and saw I was actually paying for 2 modems. The name is Docsis 3 Leased Modem and
 formerly D3 voice equipment ( which I was told is a just a modem). When I called about this issue.
 Comcast people werent available as I called after hours, So i spoke to someone on the Chat server
 which I found on the Comcast Website. I explained to him I had been overpaying since May 2014,
 that's when I checked my bills and saw I was overcharged. He was ready to pay back the $50 credit
 which i talked about in the beginning of this complaint. I am fed up with the customer service support"
612,"04/24/2015 Comcast internet service incredibly poor. Cannot watch Netflix, Google will not load, could not access a speed test, could not even open the fcc website.

613,"Hi,
 So a family member's computer was using the Comcast provided Norton Antivirus suite (link to suite: http://constantguard.comcast.net/products-and-services/norton-security-suite//) to protect their computer. They were infected with a trojan which installed a piracy server and was running heavy bittorrent traffic. We discovered this because we got multiple DMCA complaints AND a huge usage bill during a month when we were out of the country for ten days.
 I confronted Comcast with this when they last called me about a complaint I made, and they agreed that it looked like the uptick in usage from this January forward was probably caused by the virus.
 Nevertheless, they said we had used up our ""three complimentary billing modifications"" and would therefore receive no modification. We were also told that Norton does not protect against trojans and therefore it was not Comcast's or Norton's fault, which is weird because Norton says they do (link to Norton here: http://us.norton.com/security_response/malware.jsp) and so does Comcast:
 Here's more proof from their site: ( http://constantguard.comcast.net/about/ ):
 ""Constant Guard provides access to top-rated security products and services.
 Products like Norton™ Security Suite (for PC) and Norton™ Internet Security (for Mac) offer superior protection against viruses and other online threats, including spyware, trojans, worms, and bots, and are provided free-of-charge for XFINITY Internet customers. ""
 How on earth is it reasonable that despite using the security solution provided by Comcast which says (at least on their site, despite their employees being happy to say otherwise on the phone if it helps them avoid being responsible for something) that it protects against the very thing we were attacked by, we are being billed for a failure by that product?!
 The only reason we haven't switched to another provider that does not cap data usage is that we have no alternative broadband provider in our area. Their employees have shouted at us (even when we're being polite), accused us of piracy, have tried to shame us into giving up on complaints and are generally mean and unpleasant. If a grocery store or car company or any other company treated us this way, we'd tell them thanks but no thanks and go elsewhere. Not possible here. If we weren't so powerless, I wouldn't keep making these complaints.
 Thanks,

 service my area at , Duluth Georgia 30097. My only other option is to
 purchase allowance data plans from mobile telecommunication companies like T-Mobile Verizon and
 sprint at an unaffordabable rate for streaming media and daily Internet browsing."
615,"I am providing feedback because of my recent experiences with Comcast. I am an extremely
 disappointed first time customer. I first called to establish service on May 19, 2015 and unfortunately
 still do not have anything setup. I have recently downgraded and canceled several times due to poor
 customer service and broken promises from managers that technicians would come to setup my
 service. I have missed work on 5/24 and 5/26 waiting on a technician to come to appointments setup
 by Comcast and they have not shown up on two occasions. A technician came on 5/30 and told me
 that he did not have time to setup an outlet and wasn't aware that is what was needed. I contacted
 Comcast while the technician was still at my home and the manager heard the technician tell me that
 he did not have time and could not setup the outlet because he had other appointments. The
 manager was appalled and said this is not the way Comcast does business and he apologized to
 me. He again talked me into keeping the service and promised that he would have someone to come
 out by end of business day or Sunday. It is 5pm today on 5/31 and a technician has not come to
 setup my service. I've called three times and was reassured that a technician would come out today.
 My urgency to get internet is school work that I've had to go other places to get done due to no
 internet service in my home. I put $150 deposit on to establish service and when I wanted to cancel, I
 was told that I could go to the service center to be refunded. I went to the service center to be
 refunded on 5/27 and waited 45 mins in line, I was told that Comcast does not give cash refunds and
 I should receive my reimbursement via mail in 6 to 8 weeks. I was talked into keeping my service
 while there and was guaranteed that a technician would come out to set everything up. This has been
 a nightmare for me and I just want to get internet service and treated like a valuable customer."
616,"this idea is very stupid.This is not even nessecary... This is unfair to people who play games online! Just because people use Netflix instead of watching the tv is reasonable to put a 300 gb cap! I understand that you are trying to make money,but this is unfair! Wifi is not even close to phones.

Funny how this trial is being conducted in areas where they have a monopoly on high speed internet. I already pay $114 / Month just for Internet. They are trying to force the consumers to purchase their TV and phone package as well, called the triple play. Is this legal? When I signed up there were no limits on data, can they just change their contract I agreed to at their disgression?

623,"Comcast is the only broadband option in my area. They recently began limiting our data usage to 300GB a month and charging $10 for each 50GB used after that. I pay for a 50Mbps\10Mbps connection. Even if I were to look at 50% of that speed, 25Mbps\5Mbps, with a 300GB cap, and data was constantly being used during a 30day period, it equates to about 8TB. At 45Mbps, I could download 300GB in about 16hrs. For a family of four in this age of streaming video, cloud services, video conferencing, and online gaming, this data cap is ridiculous.
 Furthermore, upon nearing this cap, Comcast beings displaying a pop up in browser to warn me of my usage. This is invasive, and obtrusive. But worse, it is dangerous. This is Comcast injecting code into my request code, aka hijacking my requested data and inserting their own code. The code leaves me open to vulnerabilities and is poorly written. So poorly written that it often breaks the page request it is injected into. Here is a picture of the pop up and a cop of the injected code.

625,"My issue with Comcast stems from the fact that when I signed up for the internet service I was
 promised a flat fee, 24 month contract, and now Comcast has raised fees on equipment and refuses
 to provide a refund. My office contacted the company about 4-5times, speaking and being
 transferred to at least 10 representatives during these calls.
 The initial inquiry regarding the increase fee for equipment from $9.95 to $12.95 was on April 8, 2015.
 On April 27, 2015 after further review of billing statement, my office contacted Comcast for the
 second time. During this time, we spoke to Comcast customer representative, Priscilla Woodbury.
 Each time we spoke, the Comcast representative first pointed to the statement of work and then to
 the contract terms. However, the contract terms do not give Comcast permission to raise equipment
 fee on a flat-fee contract.
 It should also be noted that when selling me the 24 month contract the representative did not mention
 that Comcast may raise equipment fee during the life of the contract.
 At one point, one of the Comcast representatives gave us a telephone number for ""legal."" Upon
 calling the number, we were told that it was only for criminal acts on the internet and send us back,
 yet again, to the general Comcast number for billing inquiries.
 My office contacted Comcast for the third time, on April 30, 2015 and spoke to Theo, a Comcast
 representative. Theo advised us that the increase in the equipment fee was a mistake and will be
 adjusted to the promised flat fee rate. He also credited the account with a $20 (twenty dollar) credit.
 On May 11, 2015, my office received a Comcast billing statement. The billing statement
 contained a .60 cent refund only. Missing from the billing statement was the $20 refund promised by
 Theo.
 On May 12, 2015, my office contacted Comcast yet again. I urged to discuss with a supervisor about
 the poor and inconsistent customer service. Supervisor Danielle Macklin advised me that equipment
 fee is going to go up again to $12.95 (what Theo did was a onetime adjustment). Danielle advised me
 that Comcast has 100% power of raising any equipment fees and it is unclear whether I will be
 receiving the refund.
 Again, neither the service order nor the contract specify that despite selling me a flat fee contract,
 Comcast retains the right to charge increased equipment fees. This is consumer fraud when a
 Comcast representative, selling me a contract, tells me that I am buying into a flat-fee agreement that
 will not go up during the life of the contract but thereafter, I am told that Comcast can raise equipment
 fees and that this grant of power is in the contract yet the Contract does not specify this right."
626,"For a few months now I have a problem with the Internet access. It is important to note that I have two devices connected to the same cable. One of them is the cable/phone adapter that sits very close to the cable entry into the house and the cable modem that is located on the second floor. Both devices exhibit intermittent connection, and the pattern of no-connectivity is exactly the same on both devices.
 After numerous calls to Comcast and every time going through the process of plug-unplug-wait-try-again I succeeded to get the technician to agree to establish some monitoring procedure on my account to determine the cause of intermittent failures. The same technician had replaced the underground cable run with the bright orange cable running across my front yard to the cable box near the end of the property. That happened over two months ago. I was promised that the temporary cable will be replaced with an underground one when the troubleshooting is over.
 Needless to say the problem has not been solved.
 I made several attempts to contact Comcast and every time I spend over an hour on the phone being transferred several times needlessly spending the time on the same plug-unplug-wait-try-again procedure. There seems to be no record of what was done a couple of months ago. I am giving up. It feels that the customer service is designed to run us around without really addressing the problem.
 I am looking for help. I am a paying customer and have been for many years, this is not the way a company should treat customers.

I scheduled an appointment and my parents re arranged their work schedule to sit here and wait for a technician because my fiancé and I couldn't take the day off. My parents sat here for 6 hours and the technician never showed up. I called several times that day and then was told the technician had rescheduled the appointment without notifying me but that he would come that evening. He again did not show up and did not call. I was promised I would receive a bill credit for the days without service that I had been paying for, and two $20 credits for the missed appointments. I have called a number of times in the last month and they promise the credit in the amount of $66.03 and it doesn't appear. I have been promised a call back by a supervisor several times and no one ever calls me. All I want is the $66.03 credit I was promised. I paid for a service I didn't receive, and this has caused a huge inconvenience to me and my family. I also went over on my cellular data due to not having internet for 4 days but still needing to do things online like pay my bills. I need the credit to cover my extra cost on my cell phone bill.

632,"I have experienced numerous internet service outages through my Comcast of East Windsor NJ
 provider. Before I am allowed to pursue an appropriate technology solution to remedy the outages,
 Comcast first requires me to purchase unnecessary and unwanted services to hike up their fees. For
 example, instead of investigating why their rented router and modem equipment is not working
 properly, they require that I first purchase higher speed (blast) internet connectivity. When that fails
 to solve the technology issue, they then have refused or delayed removing the additional service from
 my account. Comcast also insists on scheduling a $75 service technician visit to ensure that my
 phone service is working, even though I do not use their phone service. I am subscribed to. 'Triple
 play' package that includes Internet, cable, and phone, but have explained numerous times that I use
 Comcast only for Internet and cable. Despite this the company insists on charging a $75 phone
 repair visit before they will proceed to. Insider my actual problem, which related only to chronic
 Internet service outages. This problem has not been resolved in over 2 months of repeated phone
 calls to Comcast billing, customer service, and advanced technical support. Their Security Assurance
 Team representative treated this complaint as a joke when it was brought to their attention that I
 intended to file an FCC complaint against their company for consumer fraud, which includes over
 selling, improper billing practices, and either deliberate or careless handling of call center records,

 Dear FCC Representative,
 I am writing to request a meeting with an FCC investigator regarding the complaint referenced below.
 I have been contacted by a Comcast head office official, however I find that the remedy offered to me
 is wholly unsatisfactory as of June 20th. For several months I was left without working internet
 service, and in response Comcast offered no more than a $12 refund of an extraneous fee. I had
 requested a replacement router / modem (which was proven to be the correct solution to my service
 problem) and was denied the ability to receive such a replacement. During this time I paid
 approximately $540 in service fees and encountered nearly 50 percent downtime.
 Furthermore, I believe that Comcast's practice of attempting to forced customers to purchase high
 speed 'blast' internet service was inappropriate for someone who complained about chronic outages
 but never once indicated that slow speed was at issue. I am therefore asking the FCC to conduct a
 class action investigation to better understand whether this is a systemic problem in Comcast's Call
 (b) (6)
 Center procedures and training that affects the entire class of customers who presently use their
 basic 'high speed' internet service package.
 I can be reached at to provide additional details and clarification. Suffice it to say that
 Comcast has d one its utmost to minimize this complaint by not even acknowledging the nearly 3
 months of failure in resolving the problem. Instead they have chosen to count only the time from
 which their head office became involved during the past few weeks.
 I appreciate your help in this matter and reiterate that Comcast has not resolved this issue, despite
 what I expect them to report to the FCC to try to sweep this under the rug and avoid further regulatory
 scrutiny.
 Regards,
 (b) (6)

633,"Called ahead to notify Comcast that I was moving. I was told to simply take my existing equipment
 and plug it in. That did not work. Then I received equipment in mail for ""self install"" Self install did not
 work for TV, Internet or phone. Called for activation, I was on the phone for over an hour, told there
 was an ""open ticket"" Called Comcast at least 5 times, ""open ticket, two accounts, no one could figure
 out how to help get service working. Finally ordered a Tech to come out. Tech was great but had no
 information, knew nothing about the problems I was having, took over 4 hours to get every thing
 working. Having trouble because of two accounts? On the phone for 45 minutes trying to help Tech
 figure it out. Called Comcast on 5/18 to make sure billing was correct, talked to Kevin, caller ID -
 KC3550, very sympathetic and understanding about my frustrations, said he made some adjustments
 to my bill because of the trouble I had. Phone service stopped working on 5/18, called Comcast, told
 we have an old modem, (not sure why it wasn't changed during install). On the phone again for over
 45 minutes. Asked about the credit to my bill that Kevin made, no record that Kevin did anything! He
 flat out lied to me to get me off the phone! 2nd time that has happened, I asked to speak to a
 supervisor on one of the many calls and the person just hung up on me! I am disgusted and feed up
 with the treatment Comcast has given me. I have been a customer for years and they obviously DO
 NOT CARE! We will see how it goes today with another Tech coming out to get phone service going
 (they tried to charge me $35.00 for the service call to fix what should have been done right the first
 time)."
634,"The technician from Comcast came yesterday and installed a new modem for faster Internet access.
 He found several problems with the way the equipment for our upgrade to Xfinity's premier service
 had been installed. He also installed a new modem that should have been installed when our cable
 was upgraded. THe new modem was supposed to provide us faster connections. Worked while the
 technican was here, but soon after he left it kept getting worse. Now it's no better than dialup.
 AWFUL. I HATE COMCAST!!!!! http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/916941824.png
 I pay nearly $250 per month for cable and internet. That's $3,000 annually!!! And I can't get good
 service for more than a day. I am sick and tired of it. I also CANT use my email client - Microsoft
 Outlook for Mac 2011 at home. It SIMPLY doesn't work. And Comcast won't do anything about it.
 They say it's a problem with the Microsoft product. I have called Microsoft and the technicians went
 through the settings and there's nothing wrong. They suspect that the server settings are incorrect,
 but Comcast won't do anything about it. Microsoft says I have to use Office 365 and pay them to
 access my email using Outlook. Otherwise there's nothing else they can do. Comcast keeps telling
 me the problem is with my Outlook and Microsoft must fix it.
 Comcast plays the blame game...blaming everybody else for its crappy service. Meanwhile to get the
 programming we really want - Turner Movie Classics - we MUST go with a cable company. THe only
 option is Dish Network since Verizon doesn't offer service where we live. And we've heard that the
 Internet speeds, as slow as they are with Comcast, are even worse with Century Link (Dish Network's
 partner)."

My attempts to address this issue with Comcast customer service have been met with the intent to willfully neglect the nature of our circumstance as well as the irony that they gouge low income seniors on the $10 TV service with $70 monthly internet service I have no choice but to pay with the biannual price increases. With my husband's disability and the need to expend significant amounts of time and financial resources in working with his doctors located about fifty miles away, we truly need title 2 enforced given the necessity to have broadband to make medical arrangements possible.

638,"When signing up for a bundled service in December 2014, we bought Comcast Internet, cable, and

 After 90 days. We have not received any of those. Trying to resolve this over numerous calls has
 proven unsuccessful. Each time I call, the tech seems confused about our account, they say the card
 is in the mail, they want to charge me for a dvr and showtime costs 15.00 not 5 as promised. My
 account is in good standing and I want what was promised me. I feel that they've lied to me ."
639,"After 6 months of free HBO for a smaller problem, my bill went up as they started charging me for the
 HBO. But it had gone up more than price of HBO. So I asked what options were available. Was told if
 I bundled phone into my internet and cable I'd get better price. I had been paying $147 or so month.
 Was quoted the new price would be around $100. I was talking $147 as complete price,. It turns out
 the $100 price they were quoting was for just the bundle, not other fees and taxes. I specifically asked
 about entire bill, not just the bundle. I've explained to them that they at least misled me, or lied. That
 they were talking apples to my oranges. No response to this. When I had agreed to this""Bundle"" I was
 told my first bill would be higher than $100 as the month would reflect two different purchase plans.
 But that my second bill would then be lower. To get this ""Bundle"" I had to agree to a two year
 contract, even though I've been a Comcast customer for many years. About 15-20, with a small 1
 year break when I had no internet or cable. Never had to sign another contract beside my first one
 back years ago. So I get my first bill. It's $111. As explained. I pay it and don't complain. Second bill
 comes, and it's $125, not only higher than the $100 bill I was promised, but also higher than the $111
 bill from previous month. So I start complaining to the 800#. What a run around. During one
 conversation, I'm looking at the bill, and I see my ""Bundle"" costs $99. So, I suggest to the super, that
 their salesman misled me when I was always referring to the $147 I was talking total price, not the
 bundle price, yet he only talked partial bill. This super admitted that this was probably what happened,
 but he couldn't do anything about it, as I'd bought my contract at a payment center when I paid my
 bill. So I must go back to that payment center to resolve this. He said he would email or call the
 supervisor at that payment center, to advise him of our discussion, and then he gave me a telephone
 number he said was a direct line to that supervisor, so I could make an appointment to see him. Next
 day I call this number, and it is not a direct line to him, but just another 800# reverting my call the the
 HELL Concast calls service. At this point I'm explaining my problem to yet another ignorant, useless
 operator or supervisor. Concast, and they are con artists, never keeps a record of your complaint, so
 with every new operator, I must start at the beginning, and repeat entire complaint. So this person
 explains, that there is no way to call a supervisor, they do not give out that info. So I must go in
 person, to speak to him. Which I tried. I went to the payment center, ask for super, and am told he
 isn't there, and rarely is. I can only have him call me, not make appointment to see him. Now this
 means it's at his convenience, not mine. I explain, I want to cancel my contract. Am told they can't do
 that . I must talk to super. At this point I'm given a ""We're On It"" card. It has another 800# to call for a
 no wait hot line. Again I call, again have to tell this entire saga. I explain how I was lied to for price, I
 was lied to by a super about getting a hold of super at payment center, given another 800# that didn't
 get me to that person, and that generally Concast was totally not admitting to any guilt. Every
 operator saying they had no record of these conversations, so they don't know them to be the truth.
 So I explain that they have a 30 day period to cancel a contract. Because that first bill was for $111,
 as expected, I didn't complain in those 30 days. But when I got my $125 bill I did. I had no reason to
 complain until then. So the 30 days should be extended. This super said no, they wouldn't do that.
 That the only way out was to pay a $280 termination fee. I'm furious. They lied to me numerous times,
 and won't take any blame. But I want out of these folks so bad, I agree to this $280 fee. The super
 then says I have to pass you to another operator to cancel. And this is what Concast is great at. They
 pass you to operator, to super, to operator, to super, to try and wear you out. You always have to
 retell your complaint. So, now I'm talking to the operator who will cancel my contract. I tell him I want
 my service to end a week from today. May 14th. I ask how soon do I need to return modem and cable
 TV remote, etc. He tells me a week. But there is a problem with the modem. By their records it is
 mine, not theirs. According to them I already returned it. CRAZY. Ya can't make this up. So I assure
 him the modem is theirs. We agree to turn everything off May 14th. I hang up, and run errands. I
 come home, and no internet. Cable works, but no internet. I check every connection and retry. I retry
 numerous times over the next two hours. No luck. So I call Concast. There operator again says it isn't
 their modem. It must be mine. But he tries from his computer to reset my modem any way. Tries
 numerous times. Finally he goes into my account. Asks me if I canceled my service today. I said yes.
 He fiddles around some more. Then he tells me they have turned off my internet as of then, not May
 14th. And here's the kicker. Drum roll, he tells me the only way I can get my internet turned back on,
 is to cancel the termination notice. I'm furious, and scream and swear at him. He says that he can't do
 this, I must talk to another operator. The old wear down trick. Needing my internet, I give in. I go to
 the next operator. He asks me to cancel my termination, I do, in internet comes on my computer.
 Then get this, HE can't remake my termination. Again I must go to another operator. He tells me I'll
 transfer you to this person. I'm on hold, and then get a recording that this service is closed, please
 call back tomorrow. Just pass you around until you give up. I have time to do this. Not every one
 does. This has been over two weeks of HELL. There are three other episodes like this in the past
 about vacation shut off. I forgave them for those. Not this time. Plus I fear if they turned my internet
 off once, I can't ask to terminate until it is actually the 14th of May, as they might turn it off again. Plus
 I'm worried they might double charge me the $280 termination fee. As I'm going to have to ask to be
 terminated again. With their logic, they will say I agreed to turn it back on so I should be double billed."
640,"On 6/4/15 I called Comcast because of a recent Comcast cable DSL internet service outage and said I should not have to pay for service when there is none. Comcast cust. serv. rep. agreed to reduce monthly service bill by $5. I also informed her that I keep getting delays and echoes when using VOIP with Comcast. She reset my connection and said she would start a customer loyalty discount of $5 per month for the 12 months. None of the refund or discounts has happened with my new bill and when I called Comcast cust. serv. today they say they have no record of what I was told on 6/4. When I asked for a Comcast cust. serv. email address so that I could conduct business with them in a clearly document-able way, I was told there is none! VOIP is also still a problem. This is not the first time Comcast has flat out lied -- I had similar problems when starting service with them and was told a specific internet up/download speed for a specific price and then was given a significantly slower speed for that quoted price.

 Sirs;
 Regarding the closure of my complaint, Ticket No. 363708:
 The overall purpose -- and resolution -- of my complaint is to get an accurate, reliable, recordable method of communicating and having questions answered by Comcast. That has not happened yet. Specifically, a Comcast rep., Michael M., responded to my complaint by email and gave me information that does not agree with information I obtained by contacting Comcast through their online customer chat (chat gives a text record). I emailed Michael M. on July 20 to clarify this but have gotten nothing back.

641,"I signed up for a $39.99 plan in April 2015, and in June 2015, a Comcast sales rep asked me to try their Double Play (adding TV), stating I have 30 days to change my mind and return the self install kit. I never hooked up the TV receiver and just returned the equipment. Now Comcast says I'm no longer eligible for the original plan (supposed to be valid 12 months) and must pay $66.95 for the same Internet only plan. I asked to be reinstated to the same original plan I signed up for in April and they claim it's ""not available"" because now I'm an existing customer and not a ""New customer"" The reps and their so called retention department conveniently forgot to mention this when trying to sign me up for Double Play and then cancelling the Double Play. This is a very sleazy way to get me off the original relatively low cost Internet only plan...please see the attached ""One Time Charges"" where they are billing me for Double Play that I never used, and at the higher monthly rate for the Internet Only service.

642,"I agreed to sign a 3 year contract at a fixed price of $99.80/month for telephone, internet, one (1) static IP address, and equipment fees with Comcast in January 2014. My bill increased by $3/month the later part of 2014. In February 2015 they bumped it up to $140.
 I have tried several times over the past few months to get Comcast to honor the contract terms but have failed. Today a Comcast retention specialist flat out stated that they would not honor the $99.80/month 3-year contract. To further add insult to injury, I inquired about terminating my relationship with Comcast for breach of contract. They stated they would hold me to the same contract's termination fees that they will not honor for the monthly cost. I have no other option for broadband at this location so I cannot take my business elsewhere. I must have broadband.
 I have attached the February 2015 bill and 3-year contract. I am being improperly charged. I need help because I do not have the resources to battle a multi-billion dollar corporation and the phone service representatives know it.

I called customer service billing and credit department regaurding this and he stated we said it would be ok if it was 30 extra per outlet or box.

 Just received a letter from Comcast stating my bill will now be higher than before.

646,"Recently I subscribed to Comcast's internet service in my new area. After I had already signed up for
 the service I started researching further and it turns out our data has very low monthly limits.
 Comcast is currently undergoing ""trials"" in certain markets where it is charging customers $10 for
 every 50GB used over 300GB per month. I think this is ridiculous in this day and age. Before my
 move we were serviced by Mediacom which also uses data thresholds but they do it on a much more
 reasonable level. For instance, a customer on Mediacom's 3mbps plan gets allocated 150GB per
 month, 50mbps customers are allocated 350GB per month and 105 mbps customers are allocated
 999GB per month and so on. With Comcast, it doesn't matter what speed you subscribe to, you only
 get 300GB per month.
 I went back and reviewed our last 3 months of data usage with Mediacom and we used 324GB,
 429GB and 294GB, giving our household an average of 349.13GB/month of used data. I can
 understand companies wanting to leverage how much data a customer should use but 300GB is not
 enough. We do not any type of unauthorized downloading of content. We simply stream Netflix, use
 Xbox Live, send and receive emails, and make some VOIP phone calls.
 It's not fair or right in any way for Comcast to use a one size fits all method. Customers should at
 least receive more monthly data allocation for higher speed subscriptions. I believe that Comcast is
 simply using this method as a way to get more money out of their customers.
 Please step in and tell Comcast that it's not right to nickel and dime us at every turn."
647,"Comcast does NOT offer many choices for the internet.
 Essentially they have two options..
 One is for around 6mpbs at 12 bucks or so.. I can't give you an exact figure because the weasels at Comcast won't let me look at the choices because I am behind in my bill.... In any case, the 6 mpbs is the minimum speed needed to watch (say) Netflix.
 The next choice for a faster speed is 50 mpbs... 50 is what gamers like. But it is NOT what a normal person needs for the net...
 It runs around $46 a month...
 There is NO middle ground... so most (like me) accept the higher priced one because the other is too slow...

I am told that it will take up to 60 days to cancel the service, so I will have to pay for internet for 2 extra months after I have moved out of the office. I was told I can avoid these extra 2 months of charges by convincing the next people moving in to take over my service. The people next door who are expanding into my office after I move out already have internet, possibly Comcast.

 Re: Comcast’s Collection efforts for the account of
 Dear Mr. ,
 is deceased, but that is not the problem.
 The problem is Comcast’s asinine - or perhaps wisely deceptive - manner of giving “customer support”. Comcast’s support is asinine if it is just the result of disorganization, but almost criminal if it is set up so the customer cannot easily cancel and receive verification of the cancellation.
 In my opinion, the latter seems to be the case. First I went online both by email and chat to try to cancel; I was told I had to call to cancel by phone. I called at least three times and was given a 20 to 30 minute wait time with no option for a call back. I was not going to wait, and since I was leaving on a trip I sent a letter. I did receive a call from a woman named , and she said the account was closed, but she could/would not give me a verification email or cancellation code. WHY NOT!!
 What an unpleasant surprise to arrive home to “past due” bills and “friendly” calls from your company. If only such “on-the-ball” efficiency would have been in effect when I tried to cancel.
 ’ account has been paid promptly for the past 30 years until it was CANCELLED in the beginning of April 2015. It was cancelled by me! I live alone and have been overseas since January 9 until April 10, 2015.
 Probably, I would have resumed service on my return, but now I have FIOS; you have lost/alienated a customer and created one more person who will tell others of the poor performance of your business. You can advertise “service” all you want, but the actions of your company say the opposite.
 Lastly, with the receipt of this letter I want the false billing and phone calls to stop. (b) (6)

After 2 weeks of calling our representative, we have not received any returned message or answers. Now, Comcast shut down the service at our office location, which means we don't have phone or internet service and are hurting because no one can contact us easily.

651,"Comcast has engaged in ""slamming"" by charging a different rate to my account than what was explained to me on the phone. This occurred on a retentions call with Arnisha on 2/13/2015, which I recorded in its entirety and can be reviewed here: http://gadgetscope.com/comcastfcccomplaint/
 Here is a summary of the call by timecode:
 7:20: ""$20 loyalty credit,"" which will ""take you down to $89.99.""
 7:41: I confirm that the service will remain as Digital Preferred.
 7:50: ""$89.99 a month for 6 months"" reconfirmed.
 8:20: ""For 6 months, $89.99"" confirmed again.
 8:50: ""$89.99,"" ""6 months"" and ""no contract"" confirmed again.
 At no time: Was a rate $109.99 ever discussed or mentioned.
 Subsequent to this I spoke with Mario at Comcast's executive care unit multiple times regarding errors in the discounts Arnisha had actually entered to my account. With my first contact on March 9, he promised to correct the problem, and he at that time confirmed that my discounted rate would be affected by setting my package discount rate to $109.99 and issuing two $60.00 credits, resulting in a $20/month price drop for 6 months. I agreed to this.
 In my next bill, my package rate showed as $129.99. Upon contacting Mario again, he insisted that this was correct and my bundle rate was $109.99. I offered to play the recording of my call with Arnisha, but Mario refused to listen to my recording and scheduled an internal review of Comcast's recording.
 On April 10, Mario called me and advised me that ""You were offered a credit in a lump sum to satisfy a $109.99 rate for 6 months,"" which obviously contradicts the recording I supplied above and is a lie. Mario stubbornly stuck to Comcast's lie, and here I am filing an FCC complaint.
 I request as restitution that my bundle rate be retroactively set to $109.99 from 2/13/2015 through the 6 months that Arnisha promised me (thus, combined with the lump sum credits I already have received, bringing me to $89.99), and I request a further 6 months of that bundle rate as compensation for the time spent pursuing my escalation with Comcast executive care, and this FCC complaint following lies told to me by Mario in that department.
 Comcast is the ONLY provider of wired broadband internet (per FCC's current definition) in my area, and is abusing its monopoly power by not only charging excessive prices, but slamming customers and making false statements about promised rates in recorded calls. I also ask for the FCC to pursue regulatory action to correct this pattern of abusive behavior.

652,"Hello,
 I'd like to voice my support for any legislation enacted by the FCC that would ban broadband internet
 bandwidth caps. These caps are clearly just a scam by the Comcast, Cox and other residential ISP's
 to increase their bottom line with more and more people cutting cable television but keeping internet.
 Bandwidth costs have been coming down in the last few years, unlike what the ISP's want you to
 believe that these costs have increased.
 I have almost 20 years of IT industry experience and I tell you that bandwidth costs in the last few
 years has been decreasing at an even faster rate than ever before. Just a few years ago you would
 have to pay $10000+/mo for a gigabit fiber connection, now one can be had for $4-5k/month.
 This is clearly a way for ISP's to claim that their bandwidth is ""limited"" but in reality there's plenty of it.
 What is limited, is their neighborhood network ""nodes"" that are oversubscribed and they refuse to split
 them to alleviate congestion in order so that they can claim their network is ""congested"" to justify the
 bandwidth caps.
 These caps need to be stopped before they are rolled out nationwide like I'm sure Comcast and
 others want to do ASAP.
 With cloud services becoming the norm more and more lately bandwidth should be unlimited for
 consumers to benefit from these services.
 Thanks for your time."
653,"Comcast, my ISP, often drops connections and web pages will time out, including Google.com. The service often gets throttled so I get 1/10 the advertised speeds or very high latency or both.

654,"The only available residential broadband ISP in my area is Comcast. While we'd love more competition out here, nobody seems to be entering the market. As such Comcast seems to do as it pleases pricing wise, forcing us into bundles for services we do not want or need. For example, dropping cable actually increases my costs, where as adding phone service drops it for 6 months to a year; although pricing will just go up again once that period ends.
 If there were competition they might be forced into offering better / more reliable service at more reasonable pricing to keep customers. Unfortunately AT&T's Uverse is not built out in our area so Comcast has nothing to feer.
 I'm concerned that this will only get worse once the TimeWarner merger is complete. Please work with Comcast to address their monopolistic pricing. , Alternatively, please work with AT&T to push them to delivery on the commitments from their last several acquisitions to increase broadband penetration, potentially making it a condition of their upcoming DirecTV acquisition.

 Checking back in."
655,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

656,"My internet connection is frequently below the speed that I am promised and I'm sick of paying high prices for low quality service.
 Additionally, I've had 2 service techs to my house to improve my wireless connection. Neither tech has resolved the issue, forcing me to buy my own wireless router to adequately supply wireless internet to my entire (very small) house.
 In addition to the above, my ""promotional package"" is expiring, which will increase my bill from $135/mo up to $200/mo. Comcast's new ""promotion"" is to keep my price the same, but force me to add a landline (who uses a landline?!) for an additional $35/mo, which (according to them) is going to save me $30/mo. Oh, and if I want to ""take advantage"" of this ""great deal"" I have to pay them a one-time fee of $50.
 If it's not painfully apparent, Comcast is a terrible company and they've been bending over and ass-raping their customers for so long that the execs should be charged, fined and locked away in small, shit-filled animal cages.

657,"Hello,
 I've been reading a lot online as to where to go to file a complaint about my Comcast service, and filing a complaint with the FCC has been the most popular answer.
 I am hoping someone is able to help me. I ALWAYS have a problem with Comcast.. from someone telling me they will call back and never do, to setting up a move and the whole thing turned out to be completely wrong.
 First I will start out with this past week I set up a move transfer from one house to another. After the woman I talked to said ""this call may be recorded for quality purposes"" (a call I wish could be replayed so the rep knows what a mistake she made), we went on to put in to motion the transfer of service. I said disconnect our service on April 27th (the call was on the 16th) and start service at our new house on the 30th. She verified these dates a few more times, and even said something along the lines ""are you sure the 27th? I wouldn't want you to be in the middle of a show and your tv go out"".. after the call I felt relieved everything was transferred.
 A few hours later, our internet went out. Then I got an email that said service/billing at your new home starts on 04/16/15 - which began to make me mad. The rep was very quick and friendly and I felt in good hands. (Copy of that email has been attached to this email).
 I then called Comcast and the next rep I got assured me the problem would be taken care of and took my current address Englewood FL 34224) and said he would reconnect service. A few minutes later and being on hold - this was close to 11pm, our cable goes out. He comes back and says I will have to transfer you to tech support so they can help you reconnect your service. Then told me he comes back in the following day at 2:30pm and will call me ""as soon as he walks in the door"" to begin the move transfer all over again. That call he promised never came.
 I then got another email (dated April 17 at 5am) verifying new service to be turned on at the address of Englewood FL (again our current address is Englewood FL 34224) - this email has been attached as well.
 So after getting THAT email I called again, getting more and more angry because moving or just dealing in general with ANY rep from Comcast is a nightmare I do not wish to go through. I spoke with the same rep I originally spoke with who assured me my move transfer was successful and there would be no problem, the same rep I assume is responsible for putting in the wrong dates and causes all of these problems. She said she worked in a third party website and had limitef access to my (b) (6)
 (b) (6) (b) (6)
 account so she couldn't turn my service back on for some reason, then transferred me to someone else.
 The next rep, who I was on the phone with for OVER TWO HOURS, spent a long time canceling the service at our new house (the NEW adress is Port Charlotte FL 33981), because it was turned on the 16th and wasn't suppose to be on until the 30th. She then had to cancel the request to start service on , because that isn't our address nor has it ever been our address. She then had to set up an entirely NEW account at our current house () just so we could get our service back on. After two hours of this, she finally came back to say all of our services should be working and we will need to call back in a few days after the system updates to start the move transfer again - but mid sentence the phone disconnects. I know she had my number, so I waited about 15 minutes for a call back which I never received. Went home after work to find internet and cable back on, so I assumed everything was fine.
 That night, I got ANOTHER email verifying that our service is scheduled to be turned on at (email dated April 17th at 5:03pm - also attached to this email).
 I am BEYOND angry. Every single time I deal with Comcast there is a problem. This time I will not sit around and talk to them for hours and hope the problem can be fixed. I am being proactive and emailing anyone and everyone in hopes that this will finally be a wake up call to Comcast to actually RESOLVE my problems once and for all.
 I am hoping by emailing you, you can help in someway. Thank you so much for your time and l look forward to hearing back from you,
 Current address until April 27th - Englewood FL 34224
 Address after April 27th - Port Charlotte FL 33981

 that $78 bill to a monthly plan of $59, that would be locked in, and the cable box (which I don't use,
 nor want) would be free.
 Anyway, in the last 2 weeks I've been attempting to pay my bill, and the new rate hasn't been
 reflected in the statement. Upon numerous phone call, I found that the original Sales person Lied
 about the locked in rate, apparently it was only good for 12 mos., they keep trying to charge me for a
 modem fee, (I own my own, and after repeated calls thet cannot seem to fix my bill to accurately
 reflect what is owed. They also threaten to discontinue service, If I don't pay the inaccurate amount
 by the due date. Its been about 2 weeks of phone call and and IM chats with their service dept. (I
 have screen shots of the chat sessions)
 So in short, the complaint is about fradulent marketing (telling me about locked in rates, promising
 speeds that I never get at this address, and adding and items and posting incorrect amount to my bill.
 Hopefully something can be done about this. While I am a fairly conscientious consumer, I assume
 that this problem are too much for peopele to deal with, and I'm afraid others with less patience or
 abilities just let themselves be over billed and over pormised by ComCast.
 thank you"
663,"My internet connectivity from Comcast has been poooooor at best for the past three years and I have
 requested that Comcast provide reliable internet connectivity as per my contract. They are unable to
 provide reliable connectivity and unable to explain why they fail to provide the agreed upon service.
 Comcast has a redundant loop complaint phone system that is equally unreliable requiring 10
 minutes or more to initiate a stand in line for service. Their staff are unable to resolve technical
 problems that are entirely Comcast's. All of this yet they still demand a monthly fee for terrible
 products that don't work as advertised. If I performed as Comcast does I would subject to arrest in
 many communities. When will regulatory agencies hold them accountable for their poor service,
 highway robbery pricing and no accountability?"
664,"I normally pay $41.99 a month. Just this month I get a bill that near twice that amount at $78.95. I wasn't warmed about this price change ahead of time at all. I do not feel that this is a healthy business practice. I'm pretty angry right now and feel that Comcast needs to keep with the pricing they originally gave me. Why raise the price? The speed is the same, as is my service, I haven't added anything to my service. So in that sense what is their reasoning for raising my prices? Did the internet data price go up? I don't know why it would.

665,"My service, while normally of appropriate (slower than I'd like but not terrible) speed, has been frequently disconnecting when using higher amounts of bandwidth. Anytime my household is doing something high usage (playing an online video game, downloading a video game, playing Netflix) our internet will randomly drop connection. According to our modem we are still perfectly connected and yet nothing works. This will continue happening every 5-20 minutes until we stop using the higher bandwidth. Despite several calls to Comcast over the years and three different modems (both and without the router built in) the problem persists. Add to this that our internet bill has creeped up from $30 to $68 over the course of 2.5 years at most (and has been as high as 75 during that time) for the exact same service and I would have to say I am quite displeased.

666,"I had comcast when I lived at Umatilla, FL. Right before i moved out i lost my job and my cable/internet was disconncted. A few months later i moved and wanted to get cable and internet again so i called comcast and had to pay a past due bill and had my services turned on at my current addres Eustis, fl 32726. I had service for around 9 months before it got disconnected for non payment. I recently have been able to get caught up on my bills, on my credit report that i ran 2 weeks ago it showed i owed comcast a bill of $191 and change which i agree with, i owed the money no doubt about it. So i called comcast and paid my balance due from Then a few days later i decided i will get just the interet connected with them so i place an online order for it. 2 days later i get a call from a comcast rep stating i owe a balance. I advised him that i do not owe anything that i payed off my balance. He states my act got audited and they realized i owed money from an act at Umatilla, FL. This is absolutely crazy, when i moved to Eustis i had paid that balance in full, i even had service turned on. Also my credit report even indicated that i only owed $191 and change and now comcast is stating that i owe them more money. There is something not right with this. Please help me. I did request for them to send me a new copy of this bill since i have never seen it. Also i have talked with several reps and none of them are able to send me a copy of the bill that i owe $97.19 on.

667,"As I was looking at my nearly 80 dollar a month bill for my wife and I's Xfinity Comcast internet services, I found a ridiculous comparison between my internet speed cost (""Performance"" package at 25mbps) and the highest offered (""Blast!"" at 150mbps). While it's true that the Blast! comes at a (slightly) higher out of contract cost than the Performance, it looks as though they're punishing me for purchasing less internet usage and services. It seems ridiculously unfair and crooked that I should have such an outrageous bill and being charged such a premium for buying a lesser package. Allow me to get to the nitty gritty.
 At my current subscription, again ""Performance"" with 25mbps at 66.95 (it's even more expensive than the 61.95 their website offers), I pay nearly $2.50 per mbps ( providing the ""up to"" part is what I'm really getting). The ""Blast!"" internet, the highest non-bundle plan you can get at 150 mbps at 78.95 a month at its highest, only pays approximately $.53 per mbps. In what way is it fair that MY lower internet speed is being charged at a higher premium for using LESS of their system's power? It almost seems to me that Comcast is increasing MY premium to offset the difference and offer better deals to people who want the Blast! Internet. I'm paying five times more per product given and getting five times less product!
 The only other option is that Comcast can charge me more because Century Link, the only other ""major competitor"" in many area, only offers a 7mbps plan for 29.95 a month (entry fee). In which case, Comcast is taking advantage of monopolizing my city by jacking up the price of internet.
 In short, the shady business practices in their billing department need to be examined with a fine-tooth comb. If I was being charged the same premium as the ""Blast!"" customers, I would only be paying a paltry $13.25 per every mb alloted to me! In my mind, they've got two ways to make this fair: 1) lower the price of my package to more accurately reflect my usage, or increase the Blast! to my premium and make them pay $375 a month.

668,"About 5/6 months ago I returned a HD box and one smaller box both with remote controls. I was told
 that the small box was not on my account and that they would have to investigate and get back with
 me NOTHING
 On May 19th I called about what specials you have with a triple play, The package I was offered
 included your new Xfinity 1 box, upgrade to 105 gb data, HO, Starz and Stream plex, also I could get
 additional Premium channels for only $2 more a month total package would be good for 2 years. The
 current phone modem would work for my system I said, let me call back tomorrow and I’ll confirm, the
 rep said he would attach the package to my account.
 On May 20th, I call and got some female in the Philippines. I said I called yesterday and there is a
 package attached to my account. She proceeded to ask me what the package was, then she said
 give me 2 minutes. When she came back the price increased, I said that was not right, Again she
 said give me 2 minutes, when she came back she had the right price but the wrong package again
 give me two minutes, now she got most of the package right, and again ask for 2 more minutes. She
 also said I needed a new modem, yet the prior rep said I did not. Finally after getting the initial
 package right and price right she stated that besides the price had to pay something like an additional
 $75, install and return. I said NO I am going to install by myself. Again give me 2 minutes after
 about a total 50 minutes on the phone she said that it was taken care of, but there were only a few
 minutes left for me to take the special discount. I locked in and she said the xfinity 1 box will be sent
 out 3-5 business days.
 I called back on May 21st to confirm, and spoke to a supervisor in Texas who said she would monitor,
 never hear or see anything from the supervisor.
 On May 22 I received my Comcast box, but it was another modem, I called and Comcast said they
 would send the right one out. In the mean time the DVR box I had lost channels and got worse every
 time I called. In addition my phone service went down again (this was frequent). Also same day, I
 spoke to Andre a supervisor from Columbia who tried to get my internet up, but no luck, he set up a
 service tech on May 26 for internet and DVR box.
 When the tech came out on May 26th, I spoke to him about the initial DVR box (over the phone, my
 wife was home). Needless to say he did nothing with the internet or DVR box. Later that day we
 received the Xfinity 1 box, I followed all directions, but when I went to register over the phone I kept
 getting busy signals. Finally I contacted Comcast again and she was able to register my Xfinity box.
 After going through the channels I only had the basic channels, so back on the phone to Comcast,
 Now I get Janiki from Alabama who was helpful in straightening out the issues. At this point I spent at
 least 5 hours on the phone and the internet was still not up. On May 28th, after 8 attempts I got
 through to the US and spent 2 hours getting the internet setup, during that time the US agent got
 someone from the Philippines (internet help) and again anther useless person, who spoke with a
 strong dialect, did not understand my questions and kept on saying let’s go back and start again. The
 person from the US remained on the phone while all this was going on. After the internet was up and
 the person from the Philippines was gone, I told him that he resolved 99.9% of my issues and most
 likely would have solved all of them and a lot sooner without the person from the Philippines.
 I still have the issue of the last small box I returned and have other boxes to return. I am skeptical
 that if I ship them back using UPS I have no recourse and either Comcast will say that these boxes
 are not on my account or say they never ever received them. Now on May 30, 2015, my cable is
 finally up, phone is up and intermittent internet service. I was notified that my bill is $238.78, which I
 was total over the phone would be around $165 including taxes. It should also be less due to credits
 from the above returned item, prior issues of service not being available and once the new service
 was establish, it was not totally functioning. It appears that Comcast uses off shore personal to sell,
 but when billed the Comcast customer has to again deal with the off shore incompetence in getting all
 issues resolved. I currently have spent nearly 10 HOURS with my time and do not want to spent any
 more time."
669,"On 6/15/15 at 11:30 am I spoke to Comcast internet technical support about slow internet speed. I have been paying for 50 MBPS since 10/11/13. Right after the install I realized my old modem and router would not handle the increased speed, so on 10/18/13 I purchased a new docsis 3.0 gateway and installed it. I had to call Comcast at that time to tell them about my new gateway so that the signal would go through. The technical support person told me on 6/15/15 that Comcast never updated my modem and router information with the new one and that is why my internet speeds have never been near the 50 MBPS I am paying.
 My complaint is that I have been paying for the 50 MBPS and have not been receiving it since 10/18/13. I have tried to discuss a credit or something with Comcast I got the run around. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told none were available at this time and that a supervisor would call me back, which never happened.

671,"I sign up for new service March 2015. When I received new equipment (for the second time), I returned all the product to their service center in Morton Grove IL. At the store (April 2015), I learned that Comcast created 2 ""new"" accounts for the same services (tv and internet). An apparent error on their behalf, the representative ""closed"" the account and made some ""follow up"" to ensure me that I would not be double billed. Well, not only was I billed in error by Comcast, they sent my ""disconnected"" unpaid bill to a Credit Management collection agency (855-657-8580). Because this is not my first time speaking to Comcast about billing issues with new service started in March 2015, I request a statement from Comcast to confirm that they were going to resolve this issue with the collection agency. A one month bill should have only been around $47 but the collection agency states that I owe Comcast $78. How could that be when I am a current customer and the error was brought to their attention the next month by me?
 The Comcast rep that I spoke to name was Will (ID 102787).

673,"I signed up for Comcast internet and television in June of 2013 and paid $80 for my services, the company has been relentlessly adding new charges and fees to my account without my permission or knowledge. At one point my bill reached $130, I called them and was able to negotiate the price down to $108 but it is steadily creeping upwards again. In addition to the price increases I am paying equipment fees which were hidden from me at the time that I purchased my service. My equipment fees total $10 a month for the television cable box. I was being charged $8 a month for the internet cable modem however I was able to purchase one that works with Comcast services. In order to set up my internet cable modem I had to call the company back three separate times in order for them to activate my own device, apparently they would rather have their customers rent their devices.
 If I had a choice between comcast and another cable company in the area I would choose to switch services however I do not have that luxury. Something needs to be done about this so Comcast can stop raising peoples rates without their knowledge or permission.

 I submitted ticket no. 358340 because comcast has been steadily raising my cable and internet package since I purchased it from them. However when comcast contacted me they used this FCC
 complaint as an opportunity to UPSELL me on services. This is not what I want as I need a LOWER price not a higher one. Please reevaluate this ticket.

 Request #403287 ""Comcast Retention Specialists"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #403287:
 I recently tried to cancel my cable bill since my costs were getting out of hand. Upon trying to cancel I was told that I could bundle my EXISTING services into one package for $79.99 a month. I agreed to this and was told that I would not lose any cable channels nor would I have a decrease in internet speeds. Unfortunately my internet speed dropped to 50down/10up where it was at 105down/15up before. The retention specialist lied to me and locked me into a 2 year agreement when I was promised to keep my existing internet speeds. Please work this out with Comcast as when I try to contact them I get nothing but more customer retention specialists trying to upsell me.

674,"I spoke with Comcast for an hour to get my public IP address renewed. The representative was unsure of how to do this and tried having me renew my private IP address. Upon being transferred to the highest tier technical support they were unable to release my DHCP assigned IP address either. This caused Three days of downtime and I was uncompensated for this. I can't believe that my cable company (whom I am leasing this IP address from) is unable to reset it.

 I was then sent to the customer service line to ask for credit on my account for not getting the service that I was paying for (A credit for a faulty router that seemed to completely fail for two months and the difference in the Economy speed internet v. the 50 MBPS internet) The man said he would give me a credit for $40.00 because I didn't call about the wrong service earlier.

This type of customer service is appalling and working as a supervisor myself at a call center myself any manager that spoke this way to anyone this way would be stripped of his role and suspended.
 We replaced our router and had to wait (Although I was assured there would be no wait time) for a tech to come to the front of the house to add the proper services to our line (why was this necessary if I was always set up right? Another reason I have lost faith in the customer service department).
 Again this treatment and lack of integrity from the Comcast customer service department is disappointing and I do wish this to be addressed.

 Hello,
 I wanted to share my experience I had with your Technical Support/Customer Service representatives (and managers). I have already contact the FCC and BBB about this service and hope that you see this as an opportunity to retrain the Comcast support staff. In my experience this past weekend I have talked to nearly 10 representatives and all but the staff at the Fairfield Comcast store California (they were incredibly friendly and helpful) were either not skilled in communications or in technical support.
 We have had an ongoing issue with our internet but was led to believe that the wireless modem was the issue in the slow speeds from our bedroom. We started calling technical support in where we were told that our band width was set to that of an ECONOMY service when we have been paying for the plus service (50 MBPS).

678,"Comcast wants to charge me several thousand dollars to service the home we just bought. The home
 was previously serviced by CenturyLink with DSL and Direct TV, and all we wanted to do was add
 cable service when we moved in.
 The home is in a neighborhood, and all the neighbors surrounding the home have comcast cable.
 Each home sits on a 5 acre piece of property. So to reiterate, the home across the street has cable,
 the home behind me has cable, the home beside me has cable. But the previous owner who built this
 home 20 years ago, never hooked it up.
 When I reached out to have it installed, they quoted me some huge extra fee saying this home hadn't
 paid to have cable 20 years ago. They said the information they are using to make this decision is 14
 years old. Since then, all the neighbors have installed cable, so the line is here. (Please see attached
 plat map). All the parcels surrounding on the main road SE 8th have cable.
 Is this even legal?"
679,"I Though I had a triple bundle with xfinity When I first order my service I only had an Internet service with them I bough a house and decided to keep the service so when i called to do the service transfer the person I spoke with offer me a triple bundle to keep my internet plus the other two services (cable and home security service) I was clear with the Comcast rep. when i told him i wanted to keep my internet speed with the bundle. Recently i notice my internet wasn't what i used to have conduct a speed test and came out It wasn't close to what i was told. I been on the phone back and forward with the provider for days now and there's nothing they would do to fix the issue they changed my bundle it seems to be a nice package but at the end what they did was to add everything up to my current package which increased my monthly payment now they wont fix it at all..

686,"We have Comcast ""business"" service because they are a local monopolist for non-DSL broadband. They are unable to resolve a recurring ""Security"" issue that they created by provisioning two business modems with identical static IP addresses. As a result of this issue, my business gets booted offline every two weeks when they push (misconfigured) software updates to the modems. This results in our startup business being offline for hours (and in an earlier instance 2 days) at a time where availability is critical to our survival.
 We apparently need to clean this problem up through their customer security department which is so understaffed, that wait times are up to 3 HOURS before their system summarily drops calls on hold.
 I would switch providers if I could, but see above - they're essentially a monopoly in the City of Bothell.

687,"I have multiple complaints about Comcast, my service provider:
 1. Our network speed that we get with Comcast is not what we pay for, its often much slower than the marketing and bills describe. As a result I cant help but feel lied to when i pay for one thing and get something significantly different.
 2. Our bills are often far too high and they refuse to lower them to fair levels; We find they have added a lot of junk fees at times, or simply increased prices without telling us or letting us say ""no"".
 3. It is not uncommon for me to find that they have billed me for services that I never agreed to accept.
 4. They have in the past attempted to bill me for my own hardware, and I have in the past had to pay to use my OWN EQUIPMENT.
 5. Unfair billing practices. In addition to the above its not uncommon to attempt to get these things fixed, only to be hung up on or outright told they refuse to assist me. They literally steal money form me every month and then say I'm in some sort of contract I never agreed to, that they can never give proof of.
 6. I have been forced to be a customer for years as they are a monopoly and nobody else services my area. I'm told that the reason for this is that Comcast will not ALLOW the competition when I ask other providers, and so as a result I am not able to use the providers I want to get 1gb fiber for my home as they are not allowed to service my area due to restrictions created by Comcast.
 7. I have overpaid them due to these issues and they refuse to refund my money when they should be.

 activate the new account and that would deactivate the old account. The same was done on
 04/13/15.
 Upon residing at our new address for several weeks the internet connection has been inconsistent

 wireless router wherein was told it is still linked to the old account that has still not been deactivated. I

 I have advised the situation and wanted to deactivate the account. I advised I have not received a bill
 for the new address, I am aware that I will owe money for the past month but did not want to incur
 more charges at an address where I no longer live or at my current address where the services aren't
 being provided. Out of the 5 calls I had made all representatives advised would review the matter and
 call me back, to date I have not received a call back, I have not received an email, I have not received
 a new bill nor have I received adequate service or an answer to my inquiry. I had spoken to DeSean-
 05/16/15 who advised to call back in 10 days to get a new bill and that all the services would be taken
 care of. I followed up on 05/26/15 and spoke with Don who advised the order was sent to a
 supervisor but still outstanding, he then indicated would escalate to his supervisor. On 05/27/15 I
 spoke with Tamika who advised there was no change and she would walk over to her supervisor to
 push through the deactivation and call me back. On 05/28/15 I spoke with Zaleena who indicated
 would review everything and call me back once she knew what was going on. On 05/29/15 I spoke
 with Carol who indicated she would review everything and get to the bottom of it and would call me
 back. Again, no call backs, no updates and I am still without a bill or consistent service for a product I
 am stuck with for two more years."

I called and asked why the amount for regular internet was so expensive. They told me that my promotion was over. I said that there should have been some sort of warning. I do not want to pay $45.90 a month for basic internet. The representative then said sarcastically... didn't I receive my bill. I told him yes I did but I thought that this was an accident. He then told me that he would place me on another promotion for 6 months to a year. I do not understand if I had not had a query about my bill Comcast would have continued to charge me $45.90 a month for basic internet. Only when I became uspset about the bill did they offer another promotion. They are too expensive and they take advantage of customers that are not aware!!!!

691,"COMCAST COMPLAINT WITH FCC
 Please accept this as a formal complaint against Comcast Cable Company.
 My business has been a subscriber to Comcast high-speed Internet Service for the past 10 years. However, for reasons that are unrelated to this complaint my account number changed approximately 3 years ago.
 In January 2015 I upgraded my high-speed Internet service so I can operate my phone using a voice over Internet protocol provider. I switched from high-speed Deluxe 25 Plan to Deluxe 50 Planhigh-speed plan. With my new service I would be receiving 25 more megbytes of upload and to 40 more download megabytes.
 However these speeds we're only provided for for the initial month, January 2015.
 In February 2015 I experienced my Internet speeds both upload and download slowdown and my office was experiencing poor telephone sound quality on account of the speeds not being delivered. I contacted Comcast in the middle of February and explain to them the issue and I was told by a representative they were experiencing trouble in my area while it was not an outage this speeds were not being delivered as promised.
 I did not open a ticket because I was informed that since they were aware of the issue and it was affecting a wide variety of people it would be rectified soon. Sadly the problem continued all the way until March 2015 when I called a second time and expressed my displeasure that I was being billed for services not being provided for they explained since the problem is ongoing they cannot issue a credit until the problem is rectified and that I should call back.
 In April 2015 I called back and was informed by Comcast at the problem had been rectified, after 60 days. I asked about a refund and was told someone would get back to me. Nobody ever called me back. Last week the beginning of June 2015 when I called I was informed that I would not be getting a refund since I did not open a ticket however during my initial call I was informed I could not open a ticket.
 What is so frustrating about this situation is that during my initial calls representatives from Comcast informed me that my credit would be as a matter of course as opposed to something that would have to be approved by supervisor.
 I'm very frustrated since I really have no other choice but to pay Comcast even when they do not provide the services that I pay for, please help and thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.
 The last agent I spoke with was Javier in Texas with agent ID of 538-35.

692,"I moved into my home April 1,2015. We could not pick up a signal on our mobile devics so we called Comcast and signed a two year contract to get WiFi in our home. I have an autistic 3 year old and he is obsessed with internet games and I have to be able to use my cell phone I almost daily have to connect through phone or text with his doctors, therapists, case managers and mant other people. The Comcast tech came to our house and hooked up our modem and helped us switch our cell phones so that calls would be made over our WiFi. People started telling me that they were calling me multiple times in a row and my phone would just go to voicemail my phone wasn't even ringing. Then a couple days later I would finally receive the voicemail. When we would try to make a call the person would tell us we were breaking up and they could only hear every other word, then the call would drop completely after about 3 minutes. I called Comcast and told them of my problem. They mailed me a more high tech midem which was supposed to have a 50 foot radius. We installed it and reconnected our devices still the same problems. We were also not able to connect to the internet it would almost always say no network available. Needless to say this sent my son into very unpleasant meltdowns. Once again I contact Comcast the transfer me to tech support. The tech tells me she is changing my internet to a much stronger channel and it should fix my problem well no it didn't. This last time I called they inform me they won't even talk to me about my problem until I pay them $150.00 which I really didn't want to do because I am paying for services I really didn't recieve. But I did go and pay because like I said this service is very vital to my family. When I called back I told them I think my account should be credited because I have paid for 3 months of a service I couldn't even use. The lady told me the best she could do was take off $16.00 from my bill. Then she transfered me to tech support once again. I was not home at this time and the tech lady told me that if I was unable to talk to her while standing at my modem to troubleshoot my problem then she couldn't help me. I explained to her that was impossible because of the breaking up and the call being dropped and she said that all she could do was tell me how to reset the modem and hopefully that would work. Needless to say I still don't have working WiFi.

693,"The data cap imposed by my internet service provider (Comcast Xfinity) is restricting my ability to do what I need to do on the internet. I am a full-time student on the GI Bill (USMC veteran, '08-'13), and the internet is my primary resource for completing homework, as well as learning via streaming video services. My brother is also a full-time student, earning a major in media editing - he also uses large amounts of bandwidth to complete his education. Between the two of us, we inevitably exceed our data cap every month and are forced to pay a ridiculous overage charge. We have no other options, as all ISP's in our area impose data caps. I have paid an internet bill of over $220 for one month, despite my plan costing only $29.95 / month. It is ridiculous that ISP's are allowed to do this to their customers.
 This data cap is interfering with the education benefits that I earned by serving our country. It is also affecting my family's education. Please do something about this.

694,"We are paying $95 per month for Comcast Preferred Xfinity Double Play TV and Internet that ""supposedly"" comes with internet speeds of at least 25 mbps download and 5 mbps upload. We have hardly been getting such speeds, when we have been able to connect to the internet at all. For almost the past year we have been having problems with the overall internet connectivity, such as being online and the internet going down for hours at a time. Our modem and router both show that there is still an internet connection available and working, but no device in our house is able to connect to the internet. We have tried countless times to reset the modem, contacted Comcast about it, and have gotten nowhere, with the problem seemingly getting worse if anything. This is our last resort to try and get this problem fixed in a civil manner, and sadly if this does not work we are going to have to find a new service provider, as we are tired of the poor service being provided by Comcast. I hope that this complaint will help to address the problem that has been occurring with Comcast's Xfinity Internet service not just in our own home, but in other homes that receive the Xfinity Internet service in our area as well.

696,"Comcast will not provide online content that is in my bundle (HBO Go, Xfinity TV Online) without me
 having a cable box. I think that this is purposefully blocking services in order to have equipment that I
 feel is not needed to provide me the service. If I pay for HBO Go and other online services, I should
 not need a cable box to authenticate my account. Comcast representatives state that they are unable
 to help me unless I pay for their cable box, which I feel is illegal."
697,"My complaint is the data cap is just too in realistic. I've been with Comcast for Alittle over a year now and I'm quickly learning that it's not all its cracked up to be. I was say that they are in fact a lot worse than a lot of different internet providers I've been with. I think it's pretty ridiculous that they have to have a data cap especially as low as 300gb which is outrageous especially since Comcast pays little to nothing for unlimited data yet charges customers a arm and a leg for just a little sliver of the pie and don't forget data cap included. Best part about this is the fact that lately it seems our internet reaches the limit much faster now and my family has not changed much of what they do on the internet but why the change? Why is it just now we are having these issues with trying to keep under our limits. To top it all off when i call to fibd out what change is in my usage and how to help minimize my usage, i pretty much get a we cant help you. What I'm trying to say is its ridiculous and I'm getting to the point where I'm seriously looking into another provider because its to the point where its not worth the prices hassle and data cap anymore.

Fort Collins hosts a population of 152,061 (2013) and a large public university (Colorado State University).

I am fed up with this service and every time I call them the wait time is terrible and all that happens is I get transferred around and the problem never gets solved. I didn't know to do anymore and I thought that maybe some pressure from the FCC could help to solve my own problem and millions of other's problems as well. Please help the community by giving Comcast strict restrictions on throttling a disconnection. It is past the point of wrong it is terrible.

700,"I have had Comcast for just under a year now. Tried to lower my bill as I read a recent complaint with the same issue. I pay about $75 per month for Internet and cable. When I have asked about lowering my bill and getting rid of cable they tell me just Internet will increase my bill. I would change Internet providers but Comcast runs what seems to be a monopoly in my area with the only speeds that seem to be up to my needs. I wouldn't have as much of a problem but I have had multiple providers and they seem to be the most expense and most problematic. I have had terrible service with my Internet not working and gone through 4 different modem/routers in less than a year. Also there customer service is terrible, they are so scripted and 95% of them barely speak English or just don't listen to the customers. I have not been satisfied with the services I have been paying for.

701,"My family pays for 150 megabits/second for Internet and I ran a few speed tests and I've gotten speeds from anywhere to 9 to 30 megabits.
 Speeds were great when we were upgraded to the new modem. They were verging on about 130 megabits which is fine. I understand that you can't always hit your top speeds. But not even 2 weeks later, I noticed speeds were much slower than Comcast promised.
 Now I run speed tests maybe 2 months after we upgraded our internet, and I can never get anywhere close to 150 megabits. It always seems to cap at 30 which is completely unacceptable. It's frustrating how Comcast thinks they can get away with this. I won't even go into detail about how slow our internet was before we upgraded. All I'll say is that is was far slower than what we were paying for.

I have had several reps come by and each person do little this and a little that but the problem continue. Today was the tipping point, i called Comcast to send out a maintenance person to solve the problem as I was told to do by the last Comcast rep. and when the rep showed up today, he proclaim that he was not the right person and there's nothing he could do. I waited for 4 hours to make this appointment, taking many important items off my agenda. I called Comcast and did not even get an apology for the error. There is viable competitor in the south florida area for cable. Comcast is the only player unless one wishes to switch to slower internet with ATT. How does the FCC allow Comcast to monopolize where they operate. Now they are looking to gobble up Time Warner to further the monopoly in other areas.

704,"I have never dealt with a company whose practices reflect a level of dishonesty that comes close to what I've experienced with Comcast over the past two months.
 On May 6, I had a past due balance of $33.77 on a total bill of $79.86, and was facing a service shut off, so I called Comcast to ask for an extension, which I received, having promised to make at least a $33.77 payment by May 12. My confirmation number for that agreement was 028830165. Despite this payment agreement my service was shut off the very next day, May 7. When I called to complain, also referencing my confirmation number, my service was restored, and I also insisted on a confirmation that I not be charged a re-connection fee, since the service never should have been turned off. I was promised a re-connection fee would not be assessed, with reference #028898116. I made a payment of $40.00 on May 12. I also subsequently checked my outstanding balance and ascertained that I'd been charged a re-connection fee from May 7. I called and had the fee removed.
 Then on June 6, with no notice at all, my service was disconnected. I called Comcast, which apologized and turned my service back on based on an agreement - confirmation #5643VD8 - to pay $28.93 via an automatic transfer from my checking account on June 20. Only after providing my checking information was I advised I'd be assessed a $5.99 ""convenience charge"" for making this agreement, which I was forced into if I wanted my service restored, service which had been shut off without notice! Three days after making this agreement I received a call from Comcast threatening me again with a service stoppage despite my agreement from three days earlier. I spoke to a Jennifer, ID #J6S, who apologized for the internal communications disconnect, and guaranteed my service would stay on and that my agreement from June 6 was still in place. On June 20, early in the day and then again at about 11pm EST, I checked my checking account activity and noticed no charge or pending charge for the $28.93 which I thought would automatically be deducted on that day, per the June 6 agreement. I called Comcast, and they confirmed that no deduction had been made. I spoke with operator ID#LA101045 with whom I made clear that I subsequently would make the $28.93 payment via Comcast's automated system but I wanted a guarantee that I wouldn't be double-billed the $28.93. I felt I needed to cover myself and make that payment as I'd agreed I would back on June 6, so that my service wouldn't be stopped. I immediately made the payment $29.93 after speaking with the customer service person, and my confirmation of payment number is F0AAB10. Earlier this week, on June 23, I discovered that despite Comcast's promise not to double-bill me, they double-billed me anyway. I have requested that my bank, Wells Fargo, reverse Comcast's charge against my checking account. I believe that aside from the horrible internal lack of communication at Comcast, they have now crossed a line and committed outright extortion or fraud, based on charging me after promising me that I wouldn't be double-billed. I'm disgusted with this company, and I hope you can do something to force them to change their very customer unfriendly practices and fix their internal communications breakdowns. Thanks.

 To whom it may concern:
 The following email was received by me, and a voice message left for me on the same day from a Comcast employee on June 30, but after multiple attempts on my part to respond by phone there has been no further effort by this person, Roger A., to contact me. My feeling is that they're just going through the motions:
 ""Good Afternoon Jeff Weinberger, At Comcast we strive to provide outstanding customer service and we appreciate you brining your concerns to our attention. I attempted to reach you at 954-839-5376; I left a message with my contact information. Unfortunately our attempts to reach you have been unsuccessful; please contact me via phone or email so we can discuss your concerns and come to a timely and satisfactory resolution. Best Regards, Roger A.Executive Customer RelationsComcast CorporateOffice: (954) 534-7220Office Hours: M-F: 11am – 8pm""
 The statement that their attempts to reach me ""have been unsuccessful"" is misleading since there were only two attempts, one by email, one by phone, both on June 30. To reiterate, my three attempts to call them back since I received these two communications have not been reciprocated. This company needs to get its act together and be sanctioned. They've caused me undue stress and hours of wasted time on the phone thanks to their blunders and dishonesty. I hope the FCC will act accordingly on my behalf. Thank you...

Every update gives a time it will be resolved by, and when that time approaches , they change the time. Supervisors who promise call backs with additional information, never call back. Comcast refuses to acknowledge how many customers are affected. For all we know, this outage may continue for days or weeks....with no accountability to customers. Customers have to call for credit on next bill, or Comcast does not credit them for their outage. Requests for phone numbers/addresses for consumers to elevate their questions, complaints, concerns...are denied (""we don't have that to give to you""). Basically the comcast customer is kept in the dark.

707,"Consumer is calling about Comcast cable and internet. She made a payment arrangement on 4/9/15 to make a withdrawal on 4/23/15. Comcast withdrew the money on the day she made the arrangement. She contacted Comcast and they said they would refund the money within 72 hours but she would need to provide a letter from her bank. The letter would have to be on bank letterhead and state she didn’t request a stop payment on the check. Comcast also needed the bank to state the amount of $128.22 and check #0409. She was working with Comcast Executive Relations and the reps name was Jasmine Valez. Now she can’t contact the rep since 4/14/15 and she has left messages and no return call. She has been trying to confirm that Comcast received the fax. She spoke with Executive Customer Relations today and they said they couldn’t give her anyone that could verify if they received the fax. Consumer wants Comcast to refund her money. She wants to leave their services because she doesn’t feel her information is safe with them any longer. CTR252

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 4/16/2015 6:10:24 PM:
 Please add to my complaint, Ticket No. 238647, that I spoke with Ms, Jazmine Valez today and was informed that though she thought that the accounting department could reverse that electronic draft withdrawal and refund the $128.22 that was taken from my account clearly in error, she was advised that the collections department that makes payment arrangements is a third party sub contractor and not actually a department within Comcast and because the arrangement that was made was technically a ""check"", they would not be able to reverse the transaction but would have to issue me a paper check which could take in excess of 2 weeks for me to receive!
 Ms. Valez stated that she was shocked by this response and contacted her manager which gleaned the same result. She said that as she, too is a customer of Comcast that she found this to be unacceptable and was surprised that no exception would be made as this was clearly the fault of the contractor they hired to make payment arrangements.
 Ms. Valez suggested that I contact my bank to see if they could process a dispute or a stop payment which could result in me getting my money refunded faster. I contacted my bank and it was explained to me that they could not issue a stop payment because the check already cleared and that the only thing they could do is a dispute of payment affidavit which would take 60 days to process.
 I just want my funds returned to my account. The collections person that I made my payment arrangement with never once identified themselves as a third party contractor. This would explain why when I asked to be transferred to the collections department that every representative (even the billing department) stated that they had no contact phone number for that ""department"" as they only
 make out going calls, not the honest answer that they really are not part of Comcast at all. So who exactly did I give my personal banking information to? I had to borrow money today to cover other expenses that I had today because of this.
 I just want my money returned electronically because it was withdrawn that way and I no longer want service with Comcast because I am more uncomfortable now than I was before with the way my banking and personal information has been grossly mishandled. Ms. Valez has been wonderful however, no one beyond her is motivated to correct this error.

708,"Comcast knowingly over billed me again. I recently sent a complaint and not only had conversations with them, but proved to them in writing their billing me for a service call was incorrect. Their latest bill did not remove the charges and they refuse to remove them. Additionally, they added a late fee (which could have an effect on my credit). This has been a continuous struggle with Comcast. I am asking the FCC not only to get involved and stop just sending this to Comcast to resolve... because they don't... but to fine Comcast for continuously putting customers through this horrendous activity, wasting peoples time and costing them money to resolve issues. Now they say I am being charged a late fee for their mistake. My Gosh... When will someone from the FCC actually help!!! Comcast is horrible and you know it... but you do nothing!!!

709,"Hello,
 I am having so many issues with my Comcast internet service. I am writing here in detail:
 1. Getting Service: I ordered Comcast service on 9th May. After chatting with them for an hour i purchased $39.99 monthly internet plan. Then I gave them all my information and after half hour they said this plan is no longer available, So after talking 1.5 hour i gave up on them. But finally they said this service is back on. So i bought $39.99 plan. I din't receive any confirmation about my purchase via email. I order self installation kit with no on-site technician service.
 2. After few days i received automated call from Comcast saying, We have apportionment for on site technician tomorrow. I had to call them to cancel the appointment as i din't order this service which cost $100 on first note. it was half hour troublesome call because they din't have my account number.
 3. Activating Service: Once shipment arrived, i self installed everything and tried to activate service online but couldn't do it. I called them again, they din't able to track my account number which i gave them. They kept rolling me from one department to another. Finally after 1.5 hour they able to activate my service. I also received set up box for TV for local channels, which i plugged into TV but I am not getting any channels.(I don't really care about cable because i don't use their service).
 4. I prepared online profile on their website. here i found my confirmation email for service, it says $44.99 service instead of $39.99 service. My online profile still says, i don't have activated service. Now the worst part comes, i received my first bill. Which says i have $54.99 plan plus they charged my for $9.99 for self activation kit. First i called billing department, they informed me you have $54.99 service which you need to pay. I explained them every situation but they din't agree and transferred me to customer service they told me you can get $49.99 plan now. I tried to convince them this is unfair, but they said this is the only option we can do. They said $39.99 service is no longer available, which is wrong because i told them that you still have that service on website, which is apparently in $29.99 now. They finally transfer me to sales department. Again I had to explain every details and again i received same reply. Finally they HANG UP. I called again to billing department and explained them again, Luckily this time they said everything is taken care. you have $39.99 plan now and you will receive confirmation in another 24 hours. I din't receive any confirmation so i contact them via online chat. They din't track my account first so transfer me to another department i explained them all situation over again & again they said somebody will call me in another 48 hours, Also gave me ticket number.
 Finally i din't hear anything from Comcast and I am here to write my complain. Please help me with issue.
 Thanks.

710,"I have had internet service with Comcast since December 2014. In May, I lost internet service and it could not be restored remotely. A repairman was scheduled and I was told I would not be charged for his visit. I received a bill on June 4, 2015 that showed a $50 charge for the repairman's visit. I called Comcast billing and was told the charge would be removed. (reference # 029438591). On June 13th, I went online to pay the bill and saw the charge for the repairman's visit was not removed. It appears to me the $50 charge was reduced by about $10. I immediately called the Comcast billing department. The customer service representative could not reduce the bill. She told me a supervisor would call me within 24 hours. (Of course, I have not received a call and I doubt I ever will). I am paying the bill because I want to maintain my good credit rating. However, I believe I am entitled to be reimbursed for the amount I am being charged for the repairman's visit. This was not a new install. This was the repair of internet service with an existing customer. It does not make sense that I should be paying for a service and also have to pay the company to fix its own problem. I would very much appreciate it if you would look into this matter.
 My address is , Fort Myers Beach, FL 33931. Thank you.

 I filed a complaint on March 30th 2015 regarding Comcast deceptive trade complaint ticket #207085.
 they ignored all the Laws and Regulations, they did not credit the account as it should , and they keep sending me new charges.
 here is a brief of the previous complaint. {(I have comcast account # i moved to new address, called to transfer the service they told me over the phone there will new installation for $39.99 plus your monthly charges $31.99 i said ok , they changed monthly charges to $44.99,the house i moved to had Comcast before so it was simple installation , reconnecting the connection by the pole, and then they billed me with a $253.62. would you please help me to correct that and stop that deceptive trade.thank you for your cooperation.)} and
 ((MS. Tonica Freeman
 From Comcast Executive Customer Relations.
 she sent e-mail. In the e-mail she wrote that she going to credit the account for $39.99, and after that she called left a massage saying there are other installation, I called her back no answer and left massage telling her there are no other installation she did not even put that in writing, or answer me back, but the truth is there are no other installation. And I did not here from her since.
 so I am enclosing two pictures, these pictures showing the original wiring that house has and the technician did not run any wires as she claimed, or any installation he only reconnected the wire at pole. and inside the house i have only one outlet, and the equipment connection its mine from the old house. As i said before i have been told that the new installation will be only $39.99 plus my monthly charges $31.99. plus they raised my monthly charges. Please help stop this deceptive trade. ))
 They keep sending me new charges , Please Note that i made payment for $115.00, I am Enclosing a copies of their Billing

 rescheduled and they said they don't know. I don't believe they will show. I am super frustrated as my
 children have homework assignments that require the use of the internet. I asked a friend to come out

 customer service they can not repair my service over the phone and say they have to send a

 times. the technician comes out and says our internet is working fine, and there was nothing he can
 do, which when he showed up service had become available again. so the technician did nothing at
 my house, and i asked the technician if i will be charged with this visit, he assures me that i will not be
 charged. i go to pay my bill and there is a charge on my account for a technician visit. i call comcast
 about this and they tell me it is a valid charge, so i escalate this to a ""supervisor"" who takes the
 charge off. i feel like i am being lied to and they are trying to charge me in secret. i am very
 frustrated with this company."
716,"Data thresholds are set artificially low. I live in the Nashville area and Comcast Xfinity has a data threshold of 300 GB per month. After that, the consumer is charged $10 per 50 GB. 300 GB is a ridiculously low threshold in the age of streaming music, video and watching content - especially at HD quality that most households use. My family of five easily exceeds that with watching a few favorite shows on Netflix, Hulu and iTunes movies.
 The last couple of months, my Internet overage charges equalled my contract price. Most of the country does not have overage charges yet this is a stated plan on Comcast's website to potentially roll this out nationwide.
 If anything, the use of data threshold seems designed to get you to buy expensive cable packages that no longer reflect consumer interests. I was also offered Comcast's streaming service that competes with Netflix but it also consumes data.
 The only unlimited data package from Comcast is a very expensive one through their business unit.
 Data thresholds are costly to consumers and dis-incentives people from using the Internet for content, research, exploration and learning. There is no issue of congestion and there is certainly little to no investment of new fiber lines for those who are paying these exorbitant rates.

I finally ended up in the New service X Service department.( Foreign). After looking and putting me on hold multiple times, I agreed to upgrade my service, a credit was to be issued for overcharging me for several months and we set an installation date for today between 8-12. At 11:09 I had not heard from anyone so I called to find out what time they would arrive. I was told someone changed my service yesterday, started billing me with the new service, cancelled the technician and closed the ticket saying I had the new eqpt. Rep number 2: The ticket is closed; we shipped the new cable boxes to you to set up. Rep number 3-8 - Not a clue what happened; but we will transfer you to Sales to set up another time to install. After speaking with a manager in Sales; she was working to schedule an escalated ticket. She then accidently disconnected me. She did not call back. This was 1 hr and 21 minutes later. I called back. got to another person in sales who tells me she will make the ticket; but all supervisors are in a meeting and not available.
 she assures me I would receive a call within 1 hour. 80 minutes later, no call and I call back. Again, while being transferred I was hung up on. I called back again; arriving in another foreign country to ask why I had not heard from anyone. She said ""Not to worry, she would take care of it"". She said I would receive a call within 31 minutes. Not 25 or 30 but 31 minutes. Still no call.
 It is beyond my comprehension that a monopoly the size of Comcast is allowed to operate with such lack of concern for their customers. Cable/ internet/ phone/ security - i have it all from them and they have no moral conscience to provide great service for the fortune I pay them monthly.

718,"Entered into agreement with Comcast for Internet services. Informed after first month's bill that there
 would be additional charges for receiving services related to an arbitrary data cap. This newly
 introduced model for increasing revenue targets users of Netflix and video streaming from other
 sources. This would be the opposite of an open network. This is in direct violation of the FCC's open
 internet rules. They are throttling and limiting data traffic by penalizing users with these charges and
 threatening overage fees."
719,"I current have internet service with Comcast and last month my bill was $70 dollars more than normal
 because of a data cap that they impose on customers. As there are no internet providers in my area
 that offer service without a cap I am powerless to move to a provider that does not have this ""added
 bonus"". I would implore the FCC to please look into data caps and their effects on consumers in
 areas where there is no choice. This effects people like myself more now because media like video
 and games have become so much larger in recent years with some games now using one fifth (50gb)
 of my data cap or more in some cases. Unfortuntately, this means that I am basically punished (read
 taxed) when I spend money on these types of purchases which can cause my cap to be breached
 and extra money to be paid to Comcast. This also stifles the economy by keeping people from
 spending as much money on such media so that they don't have to pay more to their internet
 provider."
720,"Comcast has implemented usage based billing in the Nashville area in the face of no broadband
 competition. The only local competitor is ATT - their footprint is smaller, services less well developed,
 and in my case not available due to my geographic location. Essentially for me, Comcast has a
 monopoly on high-speed internet services.
 It is egregious they are implementing this cap with no clear justification other than the desire to
 increase their profits as more online services continue to develop. This will stifle innovation, even as
 there is no competition.
 The method by which they are doing this is also problematic. Comcast plans come with an initial data
 cap of 300GB/mo. It offers a $5 discount from your monthly bill to lower your data cap to 5GB/mo.
 However for each 50GB over 300GB, they charge $10. Thus there is also a significant difference
 between increasing and decreasing your data cap.
 Moreover, there are neighter options for a home plan with an increased cap, nor unlimited home
 plans.
 It seems that the inconsistent pricing of data coupled with an existent monopoly is a consumer issue
 worthy of the FCC's investigation."
721,"Data caps are making the internet way too costly, for today's routine use.
 While charging overage fees, there's no way to verify their measurements of data usage are accurate. Also, they offer no help in determining how much data different applications are using, so you could budget your usage.
 Please make them remove the caps or allow competition.

722,"Confused as to why when we as customers reach our allotted limit we are penalized with a much larger bill - HOWEVER our provider can consistently deliver poor and spotty service and speeds that are FAR UNDER the MBPS speeds that are promised. We have no choice but to continue paying monthly for a service that is FAR LESS than advertised. Any complaints to the company get dismissed as ""there is nothing we can do"" or ""we don't have control over that"". Very frustrating when you rely on the internet to make a living.

723,"This is the 3rd time I have called for help regarding intermittent connection issues for my business internet. All 3 times, my appointment, which was supposed to be same day, was moved to the next day without my consent. This most recent time, I called back twice because it was nearing the end of the day and the CSR said that someone had changed the appointment to the next day. The CSR apologized and was perplexed. The CSR sent a note to local dispatch as a priority is what I was told, and I was told that a tech would be there. Again, when I called back around 7pm, I was told that someone had gone in and changed the appointment to the next day.
 On a previous incident of intermittent internet problems, the tech never showed at all. I stayed home that afternoon and night waiting on a technician to come. The issue corrected itself, but rather than call back in, I wanted to see how long it would take for comcast to call me and follow up. Two weeks later, I got an email to do a survey, so I assume that someone finally closed the ticket.
 I have now wasted valuable work and personal time and I am very frustrated. I will say that the tech Brian that arrived this time was professional and worked hard to resolve the issue. I am not waiting on a new cable to be installed and buried to permanently resolve the issue rather than someone simply leaving filters to take on and off to experiment when I had trouble with internet.

724,"I have had several issues where my cable internet and phone service has not worked because of comcast equipment. The latest today is snapped cable lines in my backyard. I have 2 puppies and this is a safety issue. My call at 2pm said I would receive a call from a supervisor within 30-45 minutes and I never got a call. This is a safety issue. At 730 pm I was told the next available appointment is 6 days from now and a tech would call if they can make it sooner. I spoke with a supervisor who said they can't get in touch with dispatch so he would elevate my call but could not guarantee that someone would be out before June 24. I have several feet of cable line laying in my yard and some of it is badly frayed. Comcast is the most expensive provider with the most incompetent customer service. Unfortunately my area doesn't offer any better service providers so I am stuck paying for it

727,"I downgraded my Comcast package in June 2014 from HD DVR Service with 140 channels and Blast Internet Speed to only Internet + Basic Digital Cable. In September, I return shipped the HD DVR box using a prepaid UPS label provided by Comcast. However, since the downgrade in June, I have been charged $10/mo for HD television upgrade, $10/mo for an additional outlet service that has not been used since 2012, and $10/mo for HD DVR services. I have contacted Comcast on 4 different occasions, most recently on June 16, 2015, and have been told they will investigate the issue and respond to me with a resolution. My issue has not been resolved. In fact, when I contacted customer service last week and requested a supervisor review my ticket, I was told that ""Managers are in meetings all day on Tuesdays"" and so there was nobody to escalate the issue to.
 The amount overcharged is now exceeding $300. I have paid each bill, in full and on time, since 2010 when we began service with Comcast. I am requesting a refund for all extra charges.

729,"I have been attempting to downgrade my internet for two weeks now as I feel the $75/mo for 50mbps is a ridiculous amount to pay. The first time I attempted to downgrade, Comcast called me several times but only left a message once with an unclear message. I called back once, but I got no answer. I also picked up once, and no one talked when I answered. What they failed to tell me was that my order would be cancelled if I didn't talk to them.
 After seeing that my order was cancelled, I made several attempts to reorder my simple order (downgrade to 25mbps internet for $25 and add basic local cable for $10 per month.. a total of $35). First thing I noticed was that I was being charged $10 per month for modem rental, but had no way of removing the rental charge despite there being an edit link that made it seem like removing the charge was possible. Second, I noticed I was being charged an installation fee, a fee that wasn't there in my previous order. I attempted to rectify all of this via live chat. I told them my issue when I entered live chat. The live chat asked me a bunch of questions, and then told me that they can not do downgrades via live chat.
 So I put my order through, with the hopes of talking to Comcast about the extra charges. They call a few times as they did before, without leaving any messages. I was finally able to get them on the line, and they tell me that the package I was attempting to order (25mbps internet for $25/mo as long as I add a cable package, and I was adding the $10/mo local cable). They told me that this package was not available to me, despite their website telling me otherwise (I was even signed in when I did this, so it should be showing me exactly what is available to me). What they countered with was a more expensive package that offered me almost identical (25mbps internet plus basic cable) but with a package that would go up in price after 12 months and then again after 24 month. Additionally what they failed to make clear is that the local package is in standard definition and that there would be extra charges for converter boxes for hd.
 I find all of this to be unacceptable. As you can see in the picture provided, I attempted to order the 25mpbs internet + local tv for $35/mo. I was told this wasn't available. I am apparently able to order a nearly identical package (but has HBO, which I don't want) for $50/mo for 12 months.

732,"I am a Comcast customer. This coming weekend, I will be moving from one apartment in Fremont to another apartment in Fremont. I own my own cable box. I will be doing a self install. Comcast informed me that the previous tenant at the address I am moving to was a comcast customer, so there would be no issue with starting service there. Then, they informed me that there would be a 6$ ""access"" fee for turning on my service. So, to reiterate, I own all of my own equipment, I will be completely setting up the equipment on my own, and a previous tenant at the new address had comcast so everything is ""good to go"" (comcast customer service person's words). However, I will be charged a 6$ access fee. Why am I being charged to do my own set up at an address that is ""good to go""? Am I paying 6$ for a technician to flip a switch somewhere? This seems highly illegal and like downright theft.

 I don't owe them any balance from the previous account.
 And on the contrary, they added new charges to my account. And they never reduced the monthly rate.
 And I'm enclosing a copy of their bill. To show that they are playing games and they have no intention to resolve this issue.

742,"I changed from att to comcast in mid November 2014. When I did I did not have telephone nor internet service. A number of technicians were sent to my home
 Finally in Mid January the problem was solved and I had phone and internet service. In the meantime, comcast kept billing me for service I did not receive.
 I have spent an untold number of hours on the phone and internet chats trying to solve the electronical problems as well as the billing. In February they gave me a credit of $95 and some old cents, I have now payed them three
 payments $85.80, $98.29,$72.55. But I have a current bill of $213.00.
 I contend that I should not be charged for the 3 months I did not have service and a $95 credit would mean my service was only $30+ a month. If I should pay the full amount that they require. I would be paying over $400 for 3 months of service. I did have a technician come to my home in February but I was told by him and a comcast phone person that I would not be charged for the call since they tried to help me over the phone and they could not.
 Please help me with this problem since I fear they will discconect my services.
 I am a 76 year woman living alone.
 Also when I got my internet back my folders disappeared. They had not helped me with that problem. On March 12 they erased all of my inbox emails.
 They have done nothing to locate the folders or the emails.

Comcast/Xfinity increased the rate and did not improve the service. I requested that the service be disconnected. I was told by the Comcast/Xfinity Costumer Retention rep that the service would be disconnected and a refund of fifty-one dollars (and change) would be mailed to me in a matter of weeks. instead of the refund I received a bill for almost 250 dollars. when I try to resolve the matter with Comcast / Xfinity, the representatives were belligerent, agressive, and dismissive. I requested to speak to a supervisor (not the first time) and was told that the supervisor would listen to the rep's recording of our conversation and call me back within hours, which did not happen. yesterday I called to follow up on the matter to be told that my account had been sent to collections.

 The matter with Comcast/Xfinity continues to be unresolved. I have attempted to contact them to midigate the matter, and I have had no satisfactory response. They have not sent the promised refund, and they are continuing to have harassing letters and collection calls directed to me.
 Do I file a new complaint with the FCC?

They charge for data even though data can be consumed by devices(phones, laptops, home security, etc.) without knowledge of the customer.

748,"I have been a loyal long term customer with Comcast and very upset that I would have to deal with such instances of poor customer service. Once again, this is very upsetting to me that I would experience such poor customer service from Comcast especially after I just had major surgery in June 2015. I informed Comcast that I am disabled since October 28, 2014 and never adjusted my bill which my income had decreased, it matters about the increase of my monthly bill since a disabled person can’t get any assistance in this matter. In May before my surgery, I had an issue with the price which was $114.88 then $24.42 for approximately three months March to May and June it rise up to $39.85 and I was informed by Comcast customer representative to call the Franchise in Montgomery County. This was totally unacceptable because if I have a question about a price I should be able to get that information from a Comcast representative. Secondly, to obtain phone records, I went through a lot to obtain that information. Stacey, executive customer care who never been helpful to me states that she can’t give that information. I have a right to my phone information and being a persistent customer I finally got that information with no problem. In addition, Comcast tech comes to my house totally disrespect me in my home in front of guest only to answer my guest question about her cable and didn’t assist me with my cable internet which I called for tech service. That same evening I had to call Comcast technical service they helped me over the phone with my internet service. As I complained about these issues, Stacey Executive customer care have not been helpful but give me several excuses why not to help me with no resolutions which I continued to complain to receive satisfactory results. I am still having problems with my internet that is slow or cut off which I calls technical service rapidly.
 Now my bill is $139.85, I called customer service to find out what happen. The customer service rep told me that I received a loyalty discount which I never informed as he continued he couldn’t answer my question. I requested a supervisor and Dennis (Supervisor) called me back with a sarcastic attitude that Comcast made a mistake on the prices that my price $139.85 had always been the price I always had. I asked so why I am being targeted about the mistake, I was very upset with his sarcastic told telling me any answers that he thought would be satisfactory. Now Comcast is raising my service to repay back for their mistake is unacceptable, this is what was told to me by the customer care supervisor Dennis. Please listen to his tape recorded message today ticket number #02850199."
749,"We pay Comcast for an advertised download speed of over 100mbps, but no matter what we try, our downloads are hard capped at 60mbps. When we upgraded from a 50mbps package (hard capped at 30mbps), we could magically reach the previously unobtainable speed of 60mbps. I don't believe for a second that it is a hardware* bottleneck since Comcast offers a 250mbps package; rather, I feel that we (and all other customers in the area) are being taken advantage of and being pushed into upgrading our packages just to reach the speeds we were promised in our current tier.
 We just want the speeds we're paying for.
 *Comcast hardware. Our router and modem are rated for much higher speeds.

751,"I have previously written to the FCC regarding overbilling of my comcast account for an 18 month period. After filing my last complaint, I was contacted by Comcast through text message and they told me they had credited my account and I had a negative balance of $19.59. I had requested several times to establish a consistent amount for my services. They did not respond. I came home last night to find that my services were again shut off. When I called their customer service number, after being transferred 3 times and left on hold for 28 minutes, I was informed that I have a balance due of $801.00. I do not know where to turn. This situation has caused me severe emotional upset and distress. They told me I was being charged with a $500.00 early termination fee plus an additional $300.00 that they could not explain. I did not terminate my agreement. I took a stand after 18 months of overpayment and being lied to by their representatives over 40 times. I finally stopped paying until they would rectify my issues. I thought they had done so on January 31st. It seems they can never be taken at their word.. I have all the text messages from them that prove what I am saying to you. Please advise me as to what I can do to resolve this impossible situation. There is no other internet provider in my neighborhood at this time. You may also reach me by phone at .

752,"I have had this problem since the end of the December. My Internet speed is 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload and what happens is at night around 5:00 pm my Internet speeds drop anywhere from 1-10 Mbps. The first tech came out in the middle of the day and thought he fixed it but that night the problem was still there. The second tech came out at night and experienced the problem but could not fix it. He told me he would call me back the next day with more info but when I didn't hear from him I scheduled a third tech. The day the 3rd tech was supposed to come out the ""tech ops supervisor"" called me and said the problem isn't inside my house and would have the maintenance crew come out and check the lines.
 So in the second week of January the maintenance crews determined that our neighborhood needed a node split. That same supervisor said it would be done within a couple of weeks. After it never getting done he kept telling me it would be soon. Then in the middle of March he said their maintenance crew told him that it is not scheduled until the end of the 3rd quarter.
 I have talked to a lot of other people in my neighborhood and they are experiencing the same problem and they have also had Comcast out for this issue. This is a daily is sure that I see Comcast doing nothing to fix. So is Comcast just expecting all of us to wait up to nine months with horrible Internet service at night?

754,"I signed up for internet service with Comcast and they mailed me out all the equipment needed to
 install internet. The day I received the equipment I installed it myself but once I called to have the
 service activated they started to give me the run around.At first they said I owed a outstanding bill and
 until I payed it I couldn't get any service. I payed what they said I owed and called back to then have
 my service activated to no avail. I kept getting transferred from one department to another till finally
 one of the reps tells me my address is nonserviceable due to someone having a bill that was not paid.
 I askedwhat that had to do with me. I stistill didn't get anywhere. I later called back and got another
 rep that said all I had to do was go to one of the Comcast offices and show my I'D and they would
 service me. I did that and they still refused me service saying someone had a previous bill at my
 address. I said once again what does that have to do with me.They said finally the person had the
 same last name as me. I said so cause you have the same last name means I know this person or
 have to be kin to them they said yes.I was so heated that I just returned their equipment and left. I
 called again explained the situation to another rep she claimed that they could now service my home
 but she lied because I was suspicious of how fast things had changed so I called another rep to
 confirm what she was saying but the rep repeated my address was nonserviceable due to past tenant
 bill. I don't think this is fair or ethical the way Comcast does business. You always get told different
 things depending on who you speak with. They bullying people to pay other people's bills and it's not
 right."

756,"I recently moved from Washington, DC to Germantown Maryland. So my initial contact to have my service moved from DC to MD was not a problem, it is the following issue that is now causing me to have to file a compliant against Comcast/Xfinity. While I do have cable service and I am promptly receiving a bill but unfortunately, I can not get anyone from IT to fix the problem that Comcast/Xfinity has caused, with regarding the accessing ""my"" own account online. On April 17, 2015 I called for two separate reasons my bill update and account changes. My billing issue was resolved and they were able to correct without issue but the second concerning my account being locked online was a little confusing. After several tickets were entered, no return calls from the IT specialist (Janae) that was supposed to be handling my ticket (her ext number is 18649) I guess decided she didn't want to return my call or wasn't. So I called again on 4/27 at 6:04pm EST, spoke with Sherita, ID F7Q, and she explained that in order to unlock my Comcast account due to the original IT technician set up an email account () making this email the primary account without providing me with a PIN number or password to access it. I explained several times to each technician that I wanted to keep my original email address that I created and password (which was explained that it would NO problem) it has still not been fixed. NOR was anything mailed to me to explain that this was done. So Sherita explained that since they can not verify who I was over the phone, they could not change nor provide me with a PIN to change the account settings. Even though during their prompts and live conversation at initial hook up, they ask for you to verify the name on account, last 4 digits of SSN, home address and your account number. So if I can set up a new account without being in-person and over the phone why can't they provide me the PIN number to correct the mistake that their own people created in order for me to access my account and pay my bill? Sherita also stated that a supervisor would be calling me within 2 hours of the time of my call, the date of this conversation was on (4/27), today is April 30th and I still have yet to receive a 2 hour call back. Some supervisor, and I still have not received my PIN in the mail.

758,"Putting a data cap on my household by Comcast is discriminatory . I own my own small business and with Internet access I can work from home several days a week. I must use the Internet to access and conduct my business. Because of the immense opportunity the Internet provides, my husband also can work from home a few days a week as opposed to having to travel across the country. Having a 300gb data cap put on my household is limiting not only my family from the freedom to access the Internet and ability to choose what programming they choose to watch; it puts constraints on an entrepreneurial spirit. Whether it is entertainment or conducting their own personal business via a the Internet, applying data cap limit by Comcast forces me as a consumer to purchase Comcast cable programming for entertainment choices. With the advances in the high quality of movies, gaming opportunities, all of which need to be downloaded plus online radio/musical access, in addition managing our family's financial position, 300gb/month data is eaten up quickly. In today's world, TV, movies, telephone, music and personal financial planning all use data. Capping the data per house is backwards in a world moving full steam ahead.

761,"We have been a Comcast customer for years and had unlimited internet usage until the last year, now we have a limit. This was all without our agreement or acknowledgement. We've dealt with the annoying phone calls letting us know we're close to our limit for months now but it recently got much worse. Our usual $80 bill was $250! Logging onto our account we saw that Comcast charged us $170 in overage fees. The first 3 reps said it would be taken off as a courtesy. When it still wasn't resolved I contacted them again to get a different story. They were very quick to tell us to stop watching Netflix if we didn't want to pay the higher bills. Not only would they not adjust our bill they suggested we upgrade service and use their version of Netflix to keep from going over. If my husband wasn't in grad school and needing the internet I wouldn't worry with it. But as it stands we are set to send an entire week's pay to Comcast to cover fees. How is this fair to us or Netflix? Why are we being punished by not buying a more expensive package? The whole thing just doesn't seem right at all. Please help.

763,"Dear FCC,
 Mario S. of Comcast’s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint (see below). While Comcast’s Mario S. accurately restated my current billing situation, his response does not explain or justify Comcast raising my cable and internet 41% one month after I became a Comcast customer. Making my senior community a single provider situation and then exploiting this monopoly is wrong and should be prevented.
 My neighbor (from three doors down the floor) told me that when she was forced into taking the landlord’s bulk cable package (as we all were) for $45.00 a month (as we all pay); Comcast continued to provide her internet for $19.95 a month. When I was forced to take the landlord’s bulk cable package, Comcast started charging me almost as much for internet ($53.95) as they had been charging me for cable and internet ($69.95).
 At a minimum, this consumer would like a justification from Comcast for their 41% exploitation. Sincerely,
 Glendale Heights, IL 60139

 To: ""
 Good afternoon
 I am in receipt of your billing complaint with the FCC. On behalf of Comcast and the Executive Care Office, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience and/or frustration we may have caused while working to resolve your issue. It is never our intention to make the resolution process difficult.
 I thoroughly reviewed your account and confirmed the video portion on your account is included with your association. Additionally I confirmed the account subscribes to performance internet at $53.95. There is also a monthly charge of $10 for the modem rental fee. The modem price increased from $8 to $10 in January 2015 with Comcast’s company rate adjustment. The details of the rate adjustments was included in your December 2014 statement (attached).
 While we continue to make investments in our network and technology to give customers more for their money, including having made 12 speed increases in 14 years, offering the fastest indoor and outdoor XFINITY WiFi connection speeds on our latest advanced Wireless Gateway and offering nearly 8 million total XFINITY WiFi hotspots, we periodically need to adjust prices due to the increases and improvements we make with these new technologies. As always, you can opt to purchase your own router and modem, and we provide a list of devices that we have certified will work with our service at http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/.

 Dear FCC,
 Mario S. of Comcast’s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint by finally revealing that Comcast was charging me for their most expensive residential service and that there were cheaper alternatives that I should be using. I have switched my internet service to the cheaper alternative. Therefore over the sixteen (16) months since I first contacted Comcast about my concerns, Comcast extorted nearly $400 from me.
 As I have previously explained, a month after becoming a Comcast customer Comcast raised my monthly bill 41%. I contacted them immediately and they ignored me. They never responded until I contacted Attorney General Madigan’s office, but even then they did not offer a solution. Comcast did not offer a solution until AG Madigan’s office referred my complaint to the FCC. By dragging this out sixteen (16) months they were able to steal nearly $400. Corporate theft by Comcast is similar to the recent AT&T and Wells Fargo thefts. Corporations find it profitable to steal from their customers, because even when they are caught their penalties are only a small fraction of their theft. With their millions of customers, their thefts would net them billions. Even with an AT&T sized fine, which most people would consider large, that amount would only be a small fraction of their theft. Corporate crime does pay. In our country, we need more Enron/Arthur Anderson type solutions to convince companies that their profits should be earned not stolen.
 Comcast is a criminal enterprise. Sincerely,
 Glendale Heights, IL 60139

764,"My Comcast internet service has not been satisfactory in the past few months. The latency/ping has increased substantially. While fast, high latency means the internet feels exceptionally slow.
 The price is also not satisfactory. I have no options for competition where I live. Comcast is the only internet service provider. I know I am being charged too much for internet and services when the new customer rate is much lower than what I am paying.
 It is offensive that a new customer gets a lower price than me, an established customer with many years of service with the company. It feels like extortion. Its also extremely difficult to even see the rates new customers get. Comcast obscures those prices at every possible opportunity on their website if I log in. I would like the new customer rate, which is substantially cheaper than what I am paying. In addition to fixing the latency of my internet.

 Hi
 Your Ticket No. 360143 was served on your carrier for its review and response.
 Your carrier has provided the FCC with a response to your complaint. You should receive a copy of the response from the carrier within 7-10 days via postal mail. As such, no further action is required. Your complaint is closed.
 Thank you for your complaint and help in furthering the FCC’s mission on behalf of consumers."
765,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

766,"I have had my Comcast modem replaced every six months for the last several years because my speed on either wireless or hardwired drops to the point that it is not functional. I rent their equipment. Comcast cannot figure out why nor do they seem to care. Their customer service personnel are useless. The wait for a service technician has been as long as a week. I am waiting again for a technician to replace the modem. The wireless signal is not working again. I am paying $90.00 a month for Blast service. I refuse to bundle because I don't want them having control of all the methods of communication in my house. Help…please.

768,"comcast is the only option of ""reliable"" internet available where I live. They can basically charge anything they like and a bunch of other things people complain about. Me? I'm complaining about the data caps. How is it possible that in a society where people use internet every day, we are capped on how much usage we can have? 300GB with modern day streaming and downloading goes by too fast. It is unrealistic to have to count everything you interact with in the Internet in order to not go over the data cap. Data caps should not exist on the Internet. The Internet should not be limited and restricted, it should be allowed to thrive freely.

769,"I have had comcast for over a year now and they have progressively gotten worse when it comes to providing cable services and helping to resolve issues. The internet goes out every day between 11am-8pm everyday. I got the usual unplug and plug it back in answer but that only works in the evening. Last time I needed a tech to come out they were cancelled on me. This evening was the last straw. The gentleman basically told me just to deal with it until a tech arrives. He had me unplug everything even though I told him I had already did that. He didn't even try and send a signal to the router. I don't know what to do anymore but I know I shouldn't be treated this way and I shouldn't have to pay for a service that only works half the time.

771,"When I complained about the large increase in my Comcast TV/Phone/Internet prices, they told me if I committed for a year, my price would be less, about $175.00 per month, which I still found high. I agreed and the first month the price was higher. The second month it was higher still. It is now about $184.00 per month. When I messaged them to complain they promised me a one time $10 credit but wouldn't honor their phone agreement. They never gave me the credit either. They also promised high-speed internet but it keeps getting slower.

772,"Comcast continues to bill for equipment I own and no longer lease. I purchased my modem in 2013. I returned my leased modem to Comcast in person and I was assured that billing for it would stop. After 3 calls, it finally did stop. Then it restarted for no apparent reason. I've now gone through that cycle at least 4 additional times. Repeated promises that the problem has been corrected go unfulfilled. Agents have hang up on me a number of times as I attempt to resolve the issue. I need a permanent solution to this illegal billing.

774,"I have had nothing but problems, with zero resolution, but am expected to continuously pay for my service. We moved from one place to another and had problems with a no show tech, and a very rude tech, who refused to do his job, until I said I was going to call customer service. I am paying for a service that only works sometimes, and when working is not fast as advertised.
 Also, I made arrangements on my bill last week for this week Friday, it's Wednesday, and my service was cut. When I called customer service, 3 out of 4 reps blatantly refused to do their job. The 4th rep restored me until Friday, as discussed previously. This is the second month in a row that this has happened. I feel that I should not have to call in and speak with 4 different people, in order to get something resolved, that should have never occurred in the first place!
 During this whole debacle, not once has Comcast offered anything to me, the customer who has dealt with horrible service since the day I signed up for self install (which is not what it seems), and a tech that never showed.
 Someone needs to be held accountable.

After being put on hold the representative told me I could have the lower rate BUT for only 6 months. I was originally lied to and so I cancelled and possibly will sign up online after 48 hrs for the lower rate if available. Otherwise I'll go back to AT&T U-verse.

783,"5/18 I called Comcast to report an ongoing issue with my video and internet. I have one box that we are not able to view tv on at all and the other boxes pixel and freeze and my internet cuts off often. I really REALLY don't like calling Comcast so I let it go for a very long time... but I did finally call and booked a tech and was very pleased that he could come out the next day. I ensured that my 21 year old Son would be home for the tech and I came to work. I work as a customer care representative for Brighthouse... My Son reported that the tech did come... spent 10 minutes outside and stated ""this is all jacked up"" and that he had called his supervisor and was waiting for him to arrive. The tech left and said the supervisor would be in touch. No one ever followed up.
 Meanwhile... life goes on and I go to work every day and my Husband goes to work every day and my service is still not working every day. I work 10 hour days 5 days a week and on my off days I see numerous Dr's due to my health issues. My Husband works 10 hour days 6 days a week and he works nights so needless to say, calling Comcast is not high on our to do list.
 My bill did get behind. I won't sugarcoat it. I paid late for a few months. but I always paid. And I paid over 250.00 a month for my services.... which were delivered to me ""all jacked up"" according to a Comcast representative.
 Today... I made a payment on my account of 350.54 and Comcast promptly took that payment and turned off my service because I still owe 140.00 more.
 I tried to call today to work out arrangements on that. While I am at work myself. I spoke to collections after finding a bypass to the automated system that kept looping me back to ""how do you want to make that payment"" and was told they would be happy to turn my service back on as long as I offered a post dated check... I do not deal with checks. I pay everything electronically. Sure... I pay it through a checking account but it is still electronically... not with a check. She claimed to understand... and sent me to billing to work out an arrangement... Billing told me that only collections can do that and only with a post dated check... But... the billing rep was going to try to help me and he put me on hold. Came back after several moments, thanked me for holding and told me that he was still working on it. Next think I know I hear a ring tone in my ear and a female voice greeting me. I explained I had been holding for a different rep and she promptly hung up the phone... ... .....
 I was out of time and patience.
 I called back during my lunch hour, spoke to collections and billing again and requested a supervisor who equally had no desire to maintain my 250.00 a month business. She even told me that collections was willing to turn my service back on but ""you don't have a checking account so we can't""... really? that's what I'm worth?
 So now I'm mad... 2 hours on the phone. I spent 1/2 hour in chat before that. While I am at work! My entire lunch hour.... no resolution... so I request a credit for the time I had ""jacked up"" service. She states they cannot credit me because that would be on the service repair dept to do and transferred me... and I waited... and waited... and my call was dropped.
 I would like my account credited, I work in tech repair so I am sure that they can verify that my signal levels to my equipment have not been up to par. I’d like that credit applied and I’d like my service turned back on with the understanding that I will pay my bill current before the next due date of 07/09/15. I’d like all this to happen with no more time spent by me on the phone. Then I’d like my service fixed.

784,"I woke up Friday 4/3 to no internet connection. That same evening after I got home from work, I signed on to the Comcast website via my cell phone data/network and went through all the steps to ""trouble shoot"" the issue--restarting the modem and router, 'forgetting' my network and reconnecting, etc. This was all unsuccessful. I then signed into a chat session with a Comcast analyst, Josean. This individual had me go through all these steps again, then restarted my modem remotely, then told me it was probably my router (which is not Comcast equipment, but third party) and had me bypass the router by connecting my computer directly to my modem via Ethernet. Still no internet. After sending me a link to complete some sort of test on my connection, I was somehow disconnected from this chat. After trying to reconnect, I got a new analyst, Helda, who started having me repeat everything I had just done. I tried explaining the situation and they eventually said they could set up an appointment with a technician, but at this point it was late Friday evening, I was already over my cell phone data and thus being charged, and I was frustrated, knowing it was a holiday weekend and not knowing what my schedule would look like starting Monday for availability for an appointment. I signed off. All weekend I tried restarting everything, powering off, reconnecting, and still no internet. On Monday morning at work, I signed on to the Comcast Support chat again and the analyst, Ankur, had me once again complete all of the steps I had already tried even though I asked if they could just please make an appointment for a technician to come out. They were convinced this was my issue because my account showed that all devices were working properly and I had full connection. I played along and re-completed all steps to fix my internet. Nothing worked--even once again, bypassing my router and trying to connect wired via Ethernet to the modem. Finally, after asking all along to make an appointment for a technician, the analyst, Ankur, scheduled a 2 hour appointment window for Tuesday morning 4/7. I verified the time and date several times. Tuesday morning, I made arrangements to be available for this 2 hour window. No one came. I called Comcast and they told me no appointment was ever made for my account. I was very frustrated, because of this and because it was day 5 with no internet. The agent I spoke with, Alex, apologized and told me she would schedule a new appointment for Wednesday 4/8 (today). I verified the time and date several times and she assured me it was scheduled. I then asked for a bill adjustment. She put me on hold for 15 minutes (while I was at work) and then told me her supervisor had approved this and I would see an adjustment on my next bill. Again, I made arrangements to be available for my new appointment this morning. Half way through my appointment window, I had not heard from anyone. I called Comcast to verify the appointment after what had already happened the day before, and once again, they told me no appointment had been scheduled. At this point, six days without internet, several hours trying to resolve the issue myself with Comcast support, and then several hours spent waiting for appointments that were never entered into the system, I was very, very frustrated. The new agent on the phone, Ronald, apologized and told me he would make a new appointment. This time, he gave me a work order # for verification and I triple checked all my info plus the time and date. Supposedly, my new appointment (the third one) is for tomorrow, Thursday 4/9, day 7 with no
 internet. I asked again, for a bill adjustment and he told me that he would ""make note of this request"" on my account. That was it. I am so angry about the inconvenience, the frustration and stress, the time out of my work day spent trying to fix this, that I sent complaint to the office of Tom Karinshak (Senior Vice President of Customer Experience at Comcast) on the Comcast website detailing everything. I received a response from Alana T. in that office that I found incredibly dismissive, that basically told me that I should have contacted Comcast sooner, and did not make enough of an effort to schedule an appointment sooner. I wrote back detailing all the efforts I had made AGAIN. Everything else aside, I cannot believe that I was told 2 appointments were made, and then they somehow did not make it to my account. Every single person that I have spoken with (5 agents in total) has told me all the same things, and I have tried them all. All 5 agents have tried to blame the issue on my router, despite the fact that it is brand new and even bypassing it gives me no internet. I have had some bad experiences with Comcast before, setting up my account in November, but I was willing to overlook them. This, however, is inexcusable in my opinion. After everything I have gone through, being charged extra on my cell phone to extra data usage because I have no internet, interrupting my work schedule for 6 hours (including tomorrow) just for appointments, several hours spent speaking with agents and trying to trouble shoot, I expect Comcast to fix it in a timely manner and credit my account accordingly. But instead, so far I have gotten a dismissive email from an Alana T. at Tom Karinshak's office, telling me I need to try harder next time, and scripted apologies from agents. At this point, I don't have much faith that a technician will come tomorrow, but even if they do, it will be 7 days without internet, and all of the hassle detailed above.

788,"I have been trying since February to get a billing issue corrected. Comcast was charging me for 7 cable boxes and I had 6. I have put in ticket after ticket with them and there is no resolve. They keep telling me they must search for the equipment. I wait 2 weeks to call back and then they just open another ticket and it goes no where. I changed the service I get with them and when the installers came, they gave me the number of the box that was stuck on my account that did not exist. The installers said they could not help me. I don't know where to go from here as they are keeping my money, passing the problem and I am getting no where.
 Also, I changed the service as I was told I would save $50.00 a month and I am only saving $30.00 - not the $50.00 I was promised. One department passes off to another and another. I don't know where else to go.

 I am not sure how this ticket can be closed. We are still dealing with the issues at hand. Some issues have been resolved, but it is untrue to say that the issues have been resolved. I do not agree with this. Comcast came to my home today to try to correct some things. Equipment that I do not have is still on my account. They have not completed their investigation.
 Please keep this open. It should never have been closed. I even wrote the person I am dealing with at Comcast and she assured me that she would not be closing anything as the problems have not been resolved. (b) (6)"
789,"My only available cable and high speed internet option is Comcast. My bill consistently and mysteriously creeps up with new fees. I call and it is lowered slightly, but then climbs again. I am unable to unbundle all the services in a meaningful manner. Internet and phone cost more than a cable package (initially), but then the package price starts to climb.
 I have no options but to pay their outrageous rates and then call when they slowly raise them. It's a game: How much can the sneak in before a customer complains. They currently have a monopoly, which is more like a stranglehold on my internet connection and fees.
 I would like other options, but none exist, as Comcast appears to have rigged the system to be the only option.

791,"The description of my problem is aptly captured here: http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/want%C2%AD-a-lower-comcast-bill-complain-to-the-fcc/ -- in a nutshell, I have the same issue as the gentlemen there. I cannot lower my Comcast bill. All I want is their Internet service, and yet they force me to buy a bundle that includes cable television b/c the bundle is actually cheaper at the time of purchase than just paying for Internet service. What's worse is that after 6 months, they'll claim the ""bundle promotion expired"" and raise your bill back up. This just happened to me. My bill went from around $40/mo back up to ~$60/mo. When I called to complain about it, they told me the bundle promotion was expired, and there were no new promotions. They also told me that dropping the bundle and just going with Internet service would be more expensive. This is absurd. They are the only legitimate option for Internet in my area. I have had it with them. I hope the FCC can look at this with a critical eye and see it for what it is and adjust their behavior.

Apparently there is a three month grace period which was January-March. This is the first time I have been informed of any of this.

794,"I have been having months of issues with my Comcast internet speed in which I cannot do things I need to do for work or personally. On Wednesday, March 25th, I spent 3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying various things. After about 2.5 hours, the customer service rep sent me to an internet expert. Once on the phone with him, I had to review my issue with him again. He read the notes and said the CS rep did everything right and I don't have a speed issue because I hit 68 mbps and it is a range issue. I told him it isn't right that I have to sit right in front of the modem to hit 68 and cannot go in the room connected to the modem room. I told him I need a fix and that I have spent 3 hours on the phone. He proceeded to tell me that he was just on the phone with someone for 6 hours who wouldn't listen and had probably be drinking. I took this as him implying that I was the same way. He told me I would have to take all my equipment in to exchange it, but it wouldn't help. After having speeds of 29 - 46 mbps I contacted my Comcast sales rep (Ron Wozny) who provided me a direct dial internet number the sales team uses which didn't work. I called him back immediately and he stated that they must have changed the number and that he would contact his supervisor and get back to me within the hour. As of today, one day later, I have not heard from him. After experiencing speeds no higher than 23 mbps today, I sent him a text to see if he had a new number and he has not responded. These are the major instances, but I have had nothing but poor service each time I have called the customer service line or my sales rep without resolution. I need this fixed or I want to cancel my service.

796,"Please reference Ticket No. 134089 that was served to Comcast Feb 20, 2015.
 I have suffered over charge after overcharge from Comcast between January and March of 2015. While it appears - at least for the moment - that Comcast has stopped billing me for a modem that I returned in December, the issue is STILL not resolved. There is still $10 outstanding owed from Comcast to me.
 I certainly understand that this is a very small amount of money, however considering the amount of time I have been required to expend to right this wrong, I really expected it to have been resolved quickly and fairly. Further, Comcast is a huge corporation that has a comfortable monopoly in my area and many others. If they take $10 from just a fraction of their choiceless customers, this represents and astounding amount of money. Finally, Comcast was formally served by your agency two entire months ago, and I am concerned that their lack of attention to my issue signifies a broader disregard and disrespect for the regulations and laws which should apply to it.
 I am hesitant to send this complaint to you, and I suspect I am not alone in that. Comcast has a great deal of power over me as a consumer. I am significantly concerned that this complaint might result in Comcast retaliating by cutting off my service - effectively removing my access to broadband internet because no reasonable alternative exists in my area. However, I feel that the right thing to do in this situation is to report the ongoing issue to you, the regulatory agency.
 Thank you so much for your time. I hope you see that my only goal is to be treated fairly as a consumer. If I didn't need you help, I wouldn't bother you for it.

 don't even get that they degraded my service unbeknownst to me.

799,"At the of May 2015, I cut the cord with cable ( dropped my bundle), after COMCAST informed me that my bill was going up to $196. I had complained to their call center over 5 times about the service and they never did anything to fix it; there was no way I would pay $200 a month for poor service. When I called to cancel the cable and phone, they kept me on the phone for over a hour, trying to convince, bully and make me keep the bundle.
 I purchased antennas which gives me the local channels and I also installed streaming devices with allow we to watch items such as SLINGTV, Netflix and a few other; basically streaming live and recorded programming.
 For the first two weeks, everything worked fine and then COMCAST began slowing down my internet speed. Initially just causing brief periods of interruptions (buffering), so I read about and purchased a Wireless Router ($300) and it corrected the interruptions.
 The router I purchased was difficult to install and I had to call Linksys Technical Support to assist with the setup. When the tech took control of my laptop, he confirmed that my internet speed was slow. The tech’s name was Micheal and the number I called was (877) 345-3657; we were on the call for 90 minutes. Today my speed is so slow that no streaming is allowed. Today I also received an automated call from COMCAST informing me that I have exceeded my data limit of 300gb and there is a charge of $10 for units of 50gb over the 300gb. I have received no information from COMCAST that indicated there was a data limit.
 Last, in frustration I did a search to find ATT Internet Service and as you can see, they blocked my search. Because I was on my home network, provided by them, they stopped me for searching for a competitor. I made the search search or my cell phone on the same network and it was blocked as well. I changed the nhetwork to my T-Moble Network and it work fine. Please see enclosed screen shots.
 COMCAST is a bully and they mistreat customer because there are very few other choices. Please let me know if there is anything you can do to assist me. For additional information, please contact the undersigned at .

 I attempted to create an account, but the system would not let me. Secondly, COMCAST contacted my telephonically today. The gentlemen insisted that they don't purposely slow down Internet speed. I explained to him that prior to dropping cable, I tested my streaming devices and the all worked fine. Once a dropped cable, I started having problems. I added a wireless router, which corrected it and my internet speed was slowed down again. He them asked if I ever hard connected to the routed, to see if it improved. I advised him that when I pay for high speed wireless internet, I should not have to hard connect to router. He then advised me that a technician will be scheduled to come check out my equipment.
 I once again do not thing anything is wrong with equipment; they purposely slowed me down and I'm not the only customer they have done this too.

 Received a call on 30 Jun 15 From at COMCAST. She went over my concerns listed in compliant. She told me they will send out a technician to see if I have a problem or not, but since I am refusing to help them trouble shot, there would be a fee. I explained to her that durning the entire year that I complained over the poor service, they never sent out a technician, indicating that my problem is/was the devices I am having problems with were simply to far from the modem. Now that I only have Internet and have filed a compliant, you now want to send out a technician. indicated that she will give me a $40 credit towards my next bill for never sending out a technician to correct the problem sooner. She insisted that COMCAST does not slow down internet speed to customers; but when I was on the phone with the company assisting me with installation of the wireless router, the technician confirmed that my internet speed was slow.

802,"My wife and I consider ourselves cord cutters. Haven't had cable for more than 6 months now. We rely heavily on streaming movies and TV shows from various websites as well as Netflix. Here's where we have the complaint. Before we moved in December we had WOW Cable and Internet. We only had cable because I got into a deal that made it only $5/month more for HD Cable with free DVR. With WOW we had basically 0 complaints about the service.
 Now we move to an area where Comcast is quite literally the only broadband option (internet being necessary for more than just cord cutting) and the service which is actually supposed to be 10mbps faster than the service we came from is terrible. Sometimes 15-20 interruptions during an hour long show on Netflix. This with what is supposed to be faster internet.
 We use our own router and a rented modem. Initially I thought it might have been people accessing the xfinity hotspot that comes built into their service that was slowing us down since we have many close neighbors. But I called and had them disable it and still the service is terrible.

803,"Several months ago I called Comcast to drop HBO and the preferred channels that they started billing me for. I called three times and finally, or so I thought I had this straightened out. I was told I only needed to pay 68.00 dollars for that month. I mailed in a 70.00 dollar check. The next month my bill showed a past due balance with my regular billing. I then made a payment for the past due balance . This was 54.00 dollars. I assumed I was back to my regular original billing. I continued to be over charged so was upset and cancelled my service with Comcast. Three days later I signed back up with comcast. I received a bill in the mail for 495.00 dollars. I called customer service and was told the bill was down to 215.00. They removed the equipment return charge. I again assumed I am on my regular monthly billing of 108.00. I called Comcast and was told this is what you have to pay. I called Comcast again and I was told that the supervisor approved a credit and I was too only pay my normal monthly amount. To be certain I called Comcast again and was told there was no credit showing up in the database. I was told to pay the 215.00. I would like to know how my bill is 215.00 dollars. The tv in my bedroom still does not work either. All this happened originally because of what I was told by a Comcast rep when I wanted to drop HBO and the Preferred channels in my original call to Comcast.

 I've asked for help and paid for their ""techs"" to come out and tell me there is nothing wrong. On the possibility that my equipment was a problem I've purchased new a Arris/Motorola modem to handle the speeds I'm paying for, a Apple Airport Extreme router, several new switches to connect all devices, new cabling for my brand new desktop, Apple Retina 5K 27inch iMac.
 I pay for the top tier speed available in my area and only once in a while do I see those speeds. Of course registering a complaint with the FCC I'm fearful that my service will start to suffer from mysterious outages and other issues.
 There is no watchdog group we can complain to or even pay someone to come out and verify speeds etc. Maybe you guys can help out.

806,"I recently moved and had comcast transfer services to our new address. Once into the new house the tech support team could not get the internet/TV working one offered to have a tech come out and get everything set up for us and also credit our account 134.93. On the day that the tech came out our account was at a zero balance as they promised but them the charges were added to a ""new account"" that they set up for us the next month. There were undisclosed charges ($70.00) to my account for the tech coming out to our house to fix the problem they couldn't fix over both chat and phone. Plus then I was charged $100 (while the tech was at my house) for what they said was a deposit for services. I later learned was an upgrade service fee that was also undisclosed. A deposit would be refundable while a upgrade fee would not be considered refundable. (Why do I have to pay to upgrade my service and also a monthly service fee plus rental/lease for their modems/routers and DVR boxes?)
 Upon receiving my bill after moving I expected the billed amount to be around $145.00 but the new statement read 328.73 + the 134.93 that had been credited to my account prior for poor support and it was due immediately. There is also slamming charges to the account for a speed increase for internet that I did not order in the amount of $46.00 plus 37.09 for a partial month amount for this service as well. I called in and spent time in the billing department when that had no resolve I asked to be escalated to a supervisor which had also no effect in correcting the issue so I threatened to cancel my service which directed me to be transferred the loyalty (save) team for comcast customers. This is where I have spent many hours over the last 3 weeks trying to settle the difference of my account. I have been threatened, yelled at, verbally abused and harassed to pay this amount that they have slammed me for and have yet had no resolve. In fact they have gone as far as to disconnect my service twice and also reinstate it after many hours of arguing and raging complaints against their collections department employees. I have more knowledge of the calling tree and comcasts inner working departments than one non-comcast employee/customer would like to have. I have spent hours upon hours trying to get a bill fixed with handfuls of operator ID numbers, voice mails left for handfuls of supervisors and nothing shows resolve or even promise of resolve. I am fearful that they will send me to collections and hurt my credit rating if I cancel their service without payment but am not sure where else to turn or what else to do other than pay the as of today and the new billing cycle 682.65 dollars. ( new billing cycle came out last night, ugh) for what should be a $143.04 bill.

I only have internet service and basic cable, and refuse to use them for phone. The only way I can get a better rate is each year to threaten to cancel or go to FiOS (which isn't really an option given my equipment investment), and then they relent and provide a short-lived promotion. I've purchased my own cable modem and TiVo, since at least I have reliable hardware. Speaking of reliability, it's been impossible to get Comcast technicians to proper fix my internet service (speed and reliability and certain times of the day). I've even resorted to replacing wiring on the outside of my townhouse at my expense. Comcast won't reimburse for that cost, nor the constant loss of service, which is almost every day.

I just received a bill which now has raised my bill to $66.95 per month.

812,"I have attempted to identify with Comcast Customer Service why my download speeds have varied
 from 94 mbps to 9.5 mbps over a period of two weeks. They sent Tech Service people and could not
 find a reason & made the suggestion I house clean my computer which I already do daily. I
 mentioned to the visiting Comcast Tech that it may be caused by a failed Splitter. We replaced it, but
 no improvement happened. I did notice the my upload speed had also dropped from 12.5 mbps to
 9.5 mbps and I mentioned this to Darack, Darack left without fixing my Internet speed variation
 problem.
 A friend suggested I see if maybe Comcast was throttle my Internet access speeds because of
 something I was doing on my PC. I found what was causing it almost right away and I've been
 tracking it for almost a week now. I listen to various NPR radio stations over the iTune Internet Radio
 service. I applied the theory and immediately found that to be the cause. Within a few minutes of
 starting the iTune Internet Radio service my Internet access speed would drop significantly. And soon
 after I stopped the iTune Radio Service on my PC, my Internet Speeds would return to norm.
 I then contact Comcast/Xfinity support via their Chat Room and asked what I should do with my
 findings. They suggested I contact a special area of Comcast Service Support where I could file a
 complaint. Within minutes of my making Comcast aware that I found they were throttle my Internet
 access, the whole problem disappeared. Now even though I access the iTune Internet Radio NPR
 stations via my PC, my access speeds have not dropped as before from 94 mbps to 9.5 mbps. Now
 they are consistently around 92 to 94 mbps where they should have been all along.
 The only logical answer is that the Comcast Service representative adjusted my Internet Access
 setting for my account so the Throttle did NOT happen any more.
 I have a few more stories about Comcast if you care to listen from when I started my service of TV,
 Telephone & Internet four months ago."
813,"Recently discovered that for at least one year I've been charged an additional $75.95 per month for internet, despite already paying for Blast Internet as part of my $199.99 HD Complete Package. That's an overbill of $911. And it probably was going on for longer than a year but only 12 months of bills are on line for me to look at. Began calling on 5/12/15 and followed up with at least 5 additional calls. Each rep acknowledges the overcharge and tells me that it has been ""escalated"" to a higher power. Usually put on hold then to speak with a supervisor and then ultimately they cut me off. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I owe them a past due balance at this point, but I don't think I should have to pay them if they owe ME a credit. Have paid the ""corrected"" monthly charges in order to keep my TV-Phone-Internet works. What brought it to my attention was a letter they sent saying that I was a ""Performance"" customer but was receiving ""Blast"" speed. Have repeatedly been told that someone will contact me to rectify. Shame on me for not realizing the overbill months ago, but for their ""customer service"" reps to acknowledge the error and NOT be able to get the credit is maddening. Thanks for any help or assistance you can provide.

815,"In August, 2014, I moved to Mississippi and obtained service with Comcast. The service was for their 19.99 internet package. They asked to switch me to paperless billing, but they told me that I could just set up autopay for the $19.99. Today, I came home to find my Internet had been disconnected due to non-payment, even though the autopay continued to go out. I called Comcast who never contacted me, who explained that I was exceeding the package, which was not explained as a possibility; and they indicated that they assumed that I had been logging into the account even though the autopay kept coming. According to Comcast, they felt I must know there was an issue and not be calling but continuing to pay the autopay. 120.00 was required to reinstate the account and a 1 hour 20 minute phone call. At this point, I now have Internet but whomever I spoke to was not able to change my account to the 29.99 level that would be adequate. Instead, they attempted to ""transfer"" me but hung up on me. Why is this unfair and deceptive trade practices? I was encouraged to go paperless. The autopay through them kept being received yet no one contacted me to advise there was an overage for 3 months, which resulted in this astronomical charge. This system is set up to allow them to take advantage of folks as they try to create revenue at the expense of customer service much less service. I would urge that you address these practices with them as they contravene any standard billing practices and could adversely impact consumers, whose credit could potentially be ruined as a result of these ""transparently"" revenue generating efforts to not follow through despite having contact information necessary to obtain the funds owed before the overage became so consequential.

 We have been on the phone with comcast for the last 4 months that we have had the service. There data caps we exceed even when there modems are not even being on (That is correct the modem for them was off for 72 hours and still they were getting data usage). According to comcast we are going through 50 gigs of data a day. My router and wifi is locked down to a point that they cannot get onto our wifi without me allowing them. Now they are charging 140 + a month extra for there extra fees for data usage. I have proven to them time and time again that it is on there end even to a point sending the techs screenshots of the data we have legitematly sent via what they are seeing. Comcast routers have been replaced numerous times and now they want to charge me even though they are at fault and all they tell me is everything is fine. I am tired of spending hours on the phone with them every week to get them to figure out what is going on. Now they want to charge 140.00 this month for overages and do nothing to figure out what is going on.

 WHat is the status of this? as they keep charging us more and more for data usage with no apparent justification other then there system is functioning and it must be us...."
817,Data cap and being charged for overages. I work from home. I can't avoid the data cap since I use a vpn for work 8 hours a day. This is ridiculous and needs to be removed
818,"I've been a customer of Comcast for only 2 months and was told by a customer service rep that I
 would be charged 24.99 a month for internet service plus an initial one time installer's fee of $20.00.
 When I got my first bill, it was what I expected which was $50+. When I got the second bill it too was
 also $50+. Then my third bill came which was $50+. When I called Comcast (Xfinity), I was told that I
 was given a credit by mistake and then I was re-billed for the ""mistake"". This is 2015 Comcast has
 been in business for a while which means that there is no reason why a company of this size should
 still be making mistakes like this. I was also told that Comcast bills 30 days in advance. I was not only
 billed on 3-12/2015, but also TWO WEEKS later on 3/29/2015/! How is this 30 days! This is
 fraudulent billing! I'm going to to see if I can get a group of people who've been misled by Comcast, to
 come together and file a lawsuit."
819,"I've been a Comcast customer for over a decade, not by choice, but because they have been the only broadband provider available to me. They have an interesting habit of charging me (and according to my internet searches, many many other customers) a rental fee on the modem I own. This eventually gets resolved but not after spending my time on multiple phone calls where I'm asked to prove that it's my modem only to see the same issue reoccur months later.
 My second, and more frustrating, complaint is their ""introductory pricing"". I want to pay a single, agreed upon price for my service without the price skyrocketing in 6 to 12 months because my ""promotion"" expired and without signing a two year contract. I refuse to agree to a contract with such an unscrupulous company who wont even show the the contract until after I agree to it (this in itself should be illegal).
 The fact that new customers get different ""promotions"" than existing customers is ridiculous, especially when there is no competition. Technically there is television competition, but that brings me to my next point:
 Comcast charges more to get internet only vis-a-vis a bundle of internet & TV. As a consumer this is absurd, but the reasons are clear: 1) they can report more TV subscribers to advertisers so they can charge more for commercials and 2) they back customers who require broadband into a corner when it comes to choosing a television provider. It's bad enough that I cannot pay for only the channels I want, but Comcast makes it fiscally stupid to use anyone but Comcast for television if you use them for internet.

821,"For some time we're experiencing technical issues with the modem.
 When we call their only number (1800-934-6489) then 3 out of 4 times we received a message that ""all circuits are busy"" and when we did get through then after 10 minutes of holding we got this announcement: ""We cannot complete your request at this time"". There was no other way to contact them so I tried through their Facebook page. A person by the name of responded to my post and this some of is what he wrote:
 ""Nobody is in total control of the situation, and furthermore, it would not be correct to assume that the issue with your modem is Comcast's fault in the first place. How do I know that you did not break the modem yourself? Should ComCast provide special attention to you just because you need your issue fixed ASAP? You do not convince me one bit. . ""
 I have the entire correspondence on their Facebook page. My complaint showed nothing but frustration and yet, he chose to suggest that this technical issue is actually my doing.
 There is no room for such behavior with customer support and especially since the only method of contacting Comcast does not work properly.
 Eventually I was able to get through to their technical support by phone, after more than an hour of trying, and they scheduled a replacement. My complaints is the availability and level of any kind of support by their Representatives

823,"I have just been made aware that my internet provider, Comcast Xfinity, has implemented their
 ""Usage Data Plan"" in my service area. I was made aware of this in an email from Comcast, stating I
 was near my data limit for the month. I was never made aware that there ever was a limit, and have
 never been notified before that I was nearing a ""limit"", even though my data consumption has not
 increased over the last several months. This is a ludicrous practice, that only further shows the sheer
 greed of this uncaring conglomerate. Please, make this stop! I should not pay twice for my internet!"
824,"My complaint is simple, Comcast's data usage cap/limit and the overage charges. Why does there need to be a limit? Is Comcast going to run out of data for it's customers? We have tried to cut back on our Comcast bill, but it doesn't help when we have to pay between 10 and 60 (that amount being the most overage charges I've seen on my bill) dollars extra, because we enjoy the internet.

825,"I moved and request to transfer my service. I was never told that it would be consider as a new customer and the charges that I would occur. When the technician came out he didn't know that I was setup as a new customer. I think that was bad communication and highway robbing people out of money. When asked Comcast about transferring service, their response is not such a thing, and it is consider a soft transfer which it is a brand new setup. I have without service since 4.11.15 with wrong information given each time I called in. We as customers pay enough money for cable as it is, but to have a $400+ bill is totally out of this world. If they need more cross training to help the customers please provide that to them. I had to take a security system with me that I am not able to use at this time, because I live in an apartment now, if I return it back I would be charged $700 cancellation fee. As a courtesy to the customer understand why before you just want to charge these crazy fees. So I took it with me paying for something I can't use until I move to another home. I will pay what I have to, but somethings they need to take into consideration . They could careless about any of this as long as I pay. As a company terminate the contract since I am not able to use it and less I have to pay in billing.

 I will like for comcast to do a follow-up to make sure all charges is deleted. I have a charge for $83.00 for installation on the security system, and I talked to someone on 5/9/2015 and stated that couldn't remove. I informed them I no longer have the security system, so I would like this charge remove. I had a contact for a representative at Comcast, but at this time I am able to find the number.

I asked for help with a data cap of 300GB which is pretty low for home users in this day and age. None of these agents helped me with this concern. merely pushed it aside as they didnt know how to deal with the situation. I was told over chat that i could view 9,900 hours of video without going over my limit. i looked at comcasts own data calculator and saw that watching 32 hours of video would take up 205/300GB. I let the customer service agent know i was displeased with the service and was still simply brushed off. Ive never had to deal with such bad customer service. One of the agents whom i spoke with ended the chat before i could send a copy of the transcript.

828,"Comcast charges overage fees for going over 300gb a month. They state on there site average users only use 20-25gb a month but this seems impossible to me, as an average user I use near or over 300gb according to Comcast but they give you know way to keep track of your data usage they just start sending you voicemails and emails that your reaching your limit. If that's the case they need a meter like the electric company so we can see real time what's going on. Otherwise your just going by what they say and they have nothing to show you how they came to that conclusion of the how much data you used in that month. It's also very misleading they promote these fast speeds but you can't even use them cause your data is capped at 300gb and they start charging you $10 automatically if you go over. The only options they give you are to pay more money for a different ""tier"" of service. I noticed even in the months when no one is home for only a few days a month it's I'm still reaching over at least 150gb and that's with no one using the internet. I have a secure router so I know it's not being used by outsiders but I also understand that there xfinity package uses data to send to the cloud from the set top tv boxes updating and storing to the cloud. Their routers also broadcast a signal so other comcast customers can use wifi if there not near their own internet am I being charged with there usage to as they are using my router as a hotspot? I really hope you guys look into Comcast's unfair monopoly of high speed internet as a hard working american and loyal comcast customer I find this very sad they are taking advantage of internet downloads by offering a high speeds that trap you into going over 300gb caps. I am in a test market for this as this is not the case for most of there customers but its been 3 years already how long is this test going? If this goes nationwide then your really gonna have upset customers like me.

831,"Internet goes in and out, lags constantly, and bills are never correct
 For the last few months, i have barely had internet in my home. I call and call and they send ""reset"" signals and tell me there is an issue with my modem. I take my modem and router to my friend's house and would you believe they work perfectly fine? And i figured maybe its due to compatibility, but that's not an issue because all my equipment is on their approved list. Its ridiculous that they constantly try to get me to rent their equipment as well. When i do have internet, it lags and the speed is not to par. I can't even stream online videos without waiting. Other times, it works wonderful and i feel thankful to have service. As a consumer, i shouldn't feel ""thankful"" when i have proper service when i am indeed paying for that service. As a full time student and employee, i barely have time to do online assignments. when i get home, i just want to shower, eat, and do my homework but i can't half the time due to my service. I usually end up using up my phone data to do my assignments or going to someone's home. The only reason i have kept their service is because it's coupled with a spanish cable tv plan that my elder parents really enjoy. However the moment that deal is up, i am leaving comcast. They are the worst internet service i have ever had. The only reason i switched over from att to comcast was due to the spanish cable since my area is not available for uverse. When this plan is up, I'm eagerly saying goodbye to comcast however it's not fair that i am paying for a service and not receiving what i am paying for. this weekend i will call for the last time to try and get my internet working. I exchanged my modem and router and will give this one final attempt.
 Aside from the lag internet service... something is always going on with my bill. I get charged for modem rentals of which i do not have and i constantly receive letters notifying me i will be charged for the rental. Naturally, when i receive the notices, i call them and they always assure me i will not be charged but sure enough, the last two months, i have been charged for the rentals.
 What really got me going today in order to file this complaint was my last recent payment for my march bill. the total was wrong for one, but i paid it to avoid a late payment knowing that they will give me credit on my account. I checked on the bill due date and i still owed the amount to i paid it as i normally would.However, this morning, i was attempting to pay a bill elsewhere and was short on funds. Im a student, the only working member of my household, so i am careful with my spending. So one can imagine how surprised i was so be short on funds. Turns out comcast withdrew a ""recurring payment"" from my account of which I NEVER AUTHORIZED on the 7th of which did not ""post"" to the account until the 8th. however, on the evening of the 8th, i checked my account and still had a payment due as i should because i have never had recurring payments, so i paid the bill. This morning, i see two charges on my bank account and am now late for a bill payment elsewhere because comcast has my funds. I called comcast asking why the recurring payment did not show up on my account and they claim the auto payment had not posted even though it was already in my
 bank account and that they would not reject a payment, it would appear as a credit in my account. I asked to get my money back to my bank and they claimed it will take 4-6 weeks. RIDICULOUS!!!! i made them leave the credit in my account and ill just use it for next month. Something is always wrong. Worst cable/internet company i have even had.

What kind of service is this? I am very disappointed with this situation... Please place yourself in my situation and tell me what would you do?
 What should I do? Complain with the Federal Trade Commission? With the Better Business Bureau? I do not like to do this, but it is very frustrating, having a business that can NOT function because of your bad service... !? VERY FRUSTRATING!

833,"I pay for comcast X1 premier. It includes every channel and with it HBO. I have tried to use HBO Go
 on both the Playstation 3 and 4 and it's blocked. I do not understand how it's possible for me to pay
 for all my services through comcast and for them to intentionally block me from accessing something
 that I pay for. I never had this problem with DirecTV. In fact, if I still had them I would be able to
 access HBOGo from any device without restriction."
834,"I called Comcast because they were having issues with my Internet speeds, I knew it didn't have nothing to do with my house because this is not the first time I had this issue, but like always they have to send someone to the house. The tech check the lines and everything was fine like I told them. So he said to me that he will scale the issue so they can check the lines outside all the way to the main office, and of course after a few days the Internet was back to the normal speeds that I had. Now Comcast is charging me $50.00 because the tech stated that he fixed something in my house which is a lie. Nothing was changed or fixed in my house plus it was fixed later which they can't apply magic to fix it from the outside when they did it days later. I been having multiple problems with Comcast and this is one of the worst issues that I had when they tried to charge for something they never did. And I have heard similar issues from other people and I see many cases online about the scams Comcast is running on their customers.

835,"At certain times of the day our service is very slow compared to others and we pay extra for a boost. Also, when you move addresses Comcast issues a new account number and may or may not send your final bill to you. If you do not pay this, they will put the account into collections and not notify you of the balance owed. The account is then put into collection status and just left there without notifying you of this. I had an account be put in collection status while paying my monthly bill on a new account because I was never sent a final bill or any follow up information. Letting the account sit and damage credit history. The only reason I found out was because I was paying from my bank account and accidentally selected the old account which became paid in full but when I called in about this they told me, no it's been in collections you should check the email account we deactivated with your service. Not only that, it took over a month to get a response when I asked them to look into the situation because I was under the impression the account had been paid in full for the previous 11 months. When I confronted them about this they said they are sorry they didn't send the bill, but nothing they could do to repair. This I understand but things cost extra with a lower credit score and this could've saved me money and a major headache. I cannot get an explanation as to why I was not contacted about this account, it just sat in collection status until I made the mistake to find it. I think this company needs to be help as accountable as I am to pay my bill to let me know I have a bill as it will take some time to repair this.

836,"Due to an Internet Outage a Comcast technician came to our home and replaced all of the ends of our Coax Cables with new ends. This helped the internet issue, however, without warning our new bill had a $100 fee for his time. We were not alerted of this fee during our phone call or the visit. Speaking with Customer Support has not helped.

837,"I am technically competent and can say that Comcast is causing very serious problems in my area. Examples: over-subscribed CMTS tail circuit, DNS service either incredibly slow or down, wild variation in hop times with loss rates over 50%, routing loops, suppression of common IP ports supposedly to throttle traffic. They are truly incompetent. In my case, the result is I have had to SHUT DOWN MY BUSINESS waiting for my connection to be reliable enough to continue. Further, in my location they are an effective monopoly as the only high-speed option available and their ""customer service"" is everything you would expect of an incompetent monopoly - slow, wasteful, ineffective, arrogant, rude, etc.

839,"Comcast is charging me for data that my household does not generate. We all work 40+ hours a week(50+ for me) and we do not download or do anything that would cause us to exceed our cap as drastically as Comcast says we do. As of right now they are charging us $180 because we somehow have downloaded 750GBs of stuff! Almost a terabyte of data! That is actually IMPOSSIBLE. In contacting their ""support"" I was met with a stonewall of redirects and arguing against the reality of the situation.

840,"I would like to complain about the recent data usage cap and excess data charges imposed by Comcast. I feel that the usage which is monitored by the supplier with no outside verification of my usage is not ethical. The only way to monitor my usage is through Comcast and this is leaving me as the subscriber to accept whatever usage number they post. Without an independent monitoring of the usage they are able to manipulate what I pay with no regulation. I only wish in my business I had the power to charge whatever I wanted without any scrutiny or regulation of the units of measurement.
 Please have a study done to see if we really are over the cap amount of data or if it really is just another revenue stream for Comcast

841,"Comcast has repeatedly made unauthorized changes to my account and refuses to make it right. Comcast randomly adds charges to my bill without authorization. They tell me a different story every time I call and then tell me they have no record of a prior call.
 I have a residential internet service line into my home. In 2009 my company had a separate business line installed- separate modem, billing, etc. For several years this billed separately and without issues. Then Comcast randomly started charging me for both services without authorization or notice. I did automatic billing so I did not notice right away the change in billing. I called last year (2014) and it came up that I had two modems-- I explained the situation to the Comcast rep and she said she must be mistaken. I called last month inquiring about my bill to see if there was a rate hike and they said I had a business line with two modems. I explained the situation for 5 different people- they just kept transferring me MID SENTENCE and I would have to start all over. All I needed was my home to be billed residential- as I originally set it up. And the business to go back to being billed to my company- as it was originally set up. Comcast could not comply with this request. THEY are the ones who changed the billing without authorization and they refused to fix it. I called my company and they went round and round and finally got the billing for their line corrected and my residential line got a credit (not for all the incorrect charges, but for 3 months worth). I called Comcast and they told me I had a credit of $98 and I asked them to make sure it was coded as a residential line and they said, ""No this is a business line, let me transfer you...."" Got to the next person on the business side and she said, ""oh you want residential, let me transfer you..."" I hung up and called another provider to come out and install service. Comcast has repeatedly ripped me off, made unauthorized changes to my account and refuses to make it right. They should not be allowed this practice of changes and charges without authorization or notification. It's theft.

843,"In March, Comcast offered our family back a one year guaranteed price of what I believed to 47.00 and change per month. I agreed to this price and thought that I had finally gotten a fair deal from comcast. My first bill was indeed $47.00 and change as per our agreement. My last bill for June was for $49.70 which I paid on time as usual. My bill that I received today is for $58.70. I just spoke with comcast customer service and was told that the new price was contingent on me agreeing to go to paperless billing back in April which would have offered a $5.00 per month discount from my bill. I pointed out that $5.00 deducted from $58.70 is still much higher than the agreed $47.00 but did not receive a sufficient response from comcast prompting this complaint. The $47.00 offer from Comcast included 50mbps of internet speed and I now have a $10.00 charge for ""blast"" which the rep explained during my call is in fact for the 50mbps plus my regular internet charges. comcast is clearly the most classless, predatory company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with and I will spend zero time arguing with them in the future, I will just file an FCC complaint and let things take their course. Thank you for your kind consideration.

850,"Probably the worst customer service I have ever been offered. I have had bad ones in the past but Comcast takes the number one spot by far. As a long time Directv customer I decided to try Comcast because of the simple reason I was moving to a different location and their pricing looked a little better. Latoya (customer service representative) painted a great picture about the package I was going to receive and about the date of the installation which was suppose to be on April 22nd 2015 and they were going to install the security system with cable and internet. The security system came with the package at no extra cost so why not try it. Being the account holder I was not going to be available on that date so after asking her if the 17th could be done, she spoke to her ""supervisor"" and they said that they would make sure it gets done on the 17th. She also said that she would contact me a few days later and email me to confirm everything. So after this long conversation on the phone everything seemed great, but no. I received a call 2 days later confirming the 22nd as the installation date. After arguing that it was confirmed for the 17th, they agreed that it would be done on that date. Then again I receive a call this time in spanish confirming installation for the 22nd. Again, I had to argue that it was initially confirmed for the 17th and any other date could not get done because of my schedule. The representative said they would make sure this escalated to their supervisor and that it would get done on the 17th. So that was that i thought everything had been resolved but then a few days later I receive a call from the installation department confirming installation for today. OK? So we went from the 17th to the 22nd back to 17th back to 22nd back to 17th then to the 13th. Then I decided to call again about this issue and to go over everything because at this point being a NEW customer the treatment I was getting was not what you would expect if you re trying to get my business. Called the customer service line trying to reach a representative and to my luck I was transferred to 3 different departments, so 45 minutes explaining the same story over and over again I got transferred to the customer loyalty department. I got fed up and asked if I could cancel the security system because that was the reason why apparently they could not install my service on the 17th. No, customer loyalty could not help me with that because I do not know since I could not understand the rep and she did not even give me time to tell her that, transferred me right over. Then I was on hold again and suddenly everything goes mute and everything is silent. There goes that call after and hour. I call regular customer service and the lady asked me why I wanted to cancel the security and I again explained, she said that before she transferred me she would see if she could help me out. Then I told her before I had to wait another hour if she could just move the installation for the installation for another date but keep my installation for the cable and internet for the 22nd. I was tired at this point so I gave in to their installation date, the 22nd, she said that would be fine. HOLD HOLD HOLD. "" Ok, ma'am I have cancelled your service"" WAIT!! WHAT? She cancelled my whole service, so now I have neither the 17th,22nd, or any other dates for my installation. I have no service again. She then goes ahead and says that she is sorry, she will try to see if she could reverse the cancellation. I was put on hold for the millionth time, I hear a different voice, a rep from the security department. So here I am no installation date, no security, no service, long hours wasted talking to no
 one qualified or authorized to fix issues, and until this day Latoya nor her supervisor Steve have emailed me or called me back. What a waste of my time. At this point I think I will pay more and get legit service then having to deal with a company that just wants your money and does not care about the customer experience or trying to resolve issues.

 Request #233624 ""COMCAST XFINITY"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #233624:
 Probably the worst customer service I have ever been offered. I have had bad ones in the past but Comcast takes the number one spot by far. As a long time Directv customer I decided to try Comcast because of the simple reason I was moving to a different location and their pricing looked a little better. Latoya (customer service representative) painted a great picture about the package I was going to receive and about the date of the installation which was suppose to be on April 22nd 2015 and they were going to install the security system with cable and internet. The security system came with the package at no extra cost so why not try it. Being the account holder I was not going to be available on that date so after asking her if the 17th could be done, she spoke to her ""supervisor"" and they said that they would make sure it gets done on the 17th. She also said that she would contact me a few days later and email me to confirm everything. So after this long conversation on the phone everything seemed great, but no. I received a call 2 days later confirming the 22nd as the installation date. After arguing that it was confirmed for the 17th, they agreed that it would be done on that date. Then again I receive a call this time in spanish confirming installation for the 22nd. Again, I had to argue that it was initially confirmed for the 17th and any other date could not get done because of my schedule. The representative said they would make sure this escalated to their supervisor and that it would get done on the 17th. So that was that i thought everything had been resolved but then a few days later I receive a call from the installation department confirming installation for today. OK? So we went from the 17th to the 22nd back to 17th back to 22nd back to 17th then to the 13th.

 Why can't they just have a better fixes rate instead of the promos that only last around 6 months and after that you can not get on a new promotion.

 445 12th Street SW
 Washington, DC

 Dear Sirs,
 I am writing to you as a result of the repeated failures by Comcast and its customer department to address long lasting unresolved issues and their policy which contravenes applicable consumer protection laws.
 In January of this year, I noticed recurring charges for services which were never requested and never delivered, starting in December 2013 which continued until February 2015. These charges included cable services which are already offered by my Home Owners Association (HOA) and included a channel package which I never requested nor have actually received. Again, I have never asked nor even received these services, but was still nevertheless fully charges.
 I immediately contacted Comcast customer service department requesting a refund for the extra charges billed and paid during those 14 months, namely the difference between $136 (monthly bills charged and paid) and $86 (monthly fee I should have been charged), which totals $700.
 On 4 different occasions, Comcast customer service department, each and every time, confirmed an error was made by Comcast, I should have been charged $86 monthly instead of $136, and that my next bill would reflect the $700 credit payable. When the next bill was actually received, all that was reflected was a 60$ discount which origins I can’t explain. This happened twice.
 In the meantime, between February 1 and 28th 2015, my internet and phone connections were functional for a total of 2 1/2 days. During that period, I contacted Comcast a total of 6 times and set up 5 different service appointments, during which the Comcast technician failed to show up on 4 different occasions. I was promised a credit of $20 per service appointment where the tech failed to show up, and reimbursement of my internet and phone fees for the month of February. Comcast once again deliberately failed to deliver.
 After a formal complaint, I was contacted on March 23, 2015 by Mrs. Edith (Eve) M., a Comcast Executive Customer Relations representative. After having to explain once again the origins of my continuous problems with Comcast, its service and billing failures, I was told by Mrs. Edith that my
 claim was filed too late and consequently, Comcast would only reimburse 2 months of excessive billing.
 This policy is a blatant violation of Florida consumer protection laws and applicable statute of limitation. Comcast cannot, unilaterally and without proper notice and consent by the consumer, limit legitimate legal actions.
 I trust a comprehensive investigation into the practices of Comcast is in order and request to be updated on the procedures and actions take.
 Kind regards,
 Hollywood Beach FL

857,"My neighbors have Comcast, however they refuse to service my address and give me not
 alternatives or options. They claim my home is too far from the tap,however my home is extremely
 near to the tap, less than 100ft. They claim I cannot be connected because the cable length required
 to run to my home would exceed 300ft as they have to run it through to the other side of the home
 going around either the back or the front and up to the meter box before any cable enters the home.
 I do not have any other cable internet options and I believe my address is being discriminated against
 because I am not asking for their top tier cable bundle. I have tried working with their service
 department but again they are unwilling to go over any options with me. I had to make 3 different calls
 to get an idea as to why the technician scheduled to come out between 1pm and 5pm today had not
 shown up. Their dispatch department claimed a supervisor surveyed the site and deemed it non
 serviceable after a technician had previously deemed it serviceable. I am outraged."
858,"Hello, I have Comcast for my TV and internet service. I originally took advantage of a 12 month promo for $99.00 for TV and Internet high speed. The promo ended in Dec 2014 and Comcast was suppose to tell me of the Promo ending so that I can choose another package, of course that did not occur and the monthly fees sky rocketed to over $250.00 monthly.I was then told over the phone that they will adjust the overcharge for the past 4 months and so far they keep on giving me the4 run around. In the past months I have paid over $700.00 since i do not want to ruin my credit and stop paying as I should, but I work really hard for my income and to keep my credit clean. Comcast is a very large company that believes that they can do anything they wish with the consumers but I do know my rights!!! We are now in April and I did another contract for 24 months, but I was told by Comcast that I now owe $400.00 more dollars so that they do not disconnect my services. I wish I did but I need to have the internet so that my child is able to do the homework and get ahead in life. It is impossible for me to pay these obscene amounts for a service that should be one third the cost; don't get me wrong, they provide a service and I am willing to pay my price but when it gets to being dishonnest, I WILL NOT!
 I am filing this complaint to please forward where it is needed at Comcast to be able to keep my services without having to pay another mortgage.
 Thank you for your help in advance,

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 5/20/2015 7:09:36 AM:
 Nothing was resolved
 Sent from my iPhone"
859,"I have been a loyal customer of Comcast. I had a promotion that included basic cable and internet of
 50 Mbps for 12 months, after the promotion ended the price went up as we discussed the 12 months
 prior. I looked for a promotion online and found one. The date was April 12, 2015 and I have the
 whole chat log as Comcast allows you to save it after you are done. Anyways, that day I decided to
 chat with a representative online and he told me the offer was only for new customers although the
 website doesn't have a disclaimer saying so. Okay, that's fine, I decided during the chat to lower my
 bill if I could not get the service I was looking for and he said he needed my account information
 which is reasonable. He looked up promotions in my area and found one which lowered my bill to
 $29.99 and didn't include the basic cable. I was 100% fine with that. The representative told me that
 my modem rental was another $10 so it pushed it up to $40 give or take a few cents. This new
 service was 25 Mbps internet and that was it. It was a very simple promotion that lasts 12 months so I
 went with it and accepted it.
 Now, almost a month later, May 4, 2015 I received the new internet bill to only discover that it
 remained unchanged. It came out to $85.31 more than double what was said a month prior on April
 12, 2015. I assumed it may have been a simple mistake so I called the same date. I called a total of 5
 times in English and every single time I had gone through the whole menu and was finally going to be
 connected to a customer representative, it was hung up, my phone had perfect signal. I called 1 time
 after another for the 5 times I did so. I eventually decided to call a few minutes later but in Spanish as
 I am bilingual and I finally got through. Someone answered me and after speaking for some time and
 telling her my situation she then proceeded to try and add more to my service which made no sense. I
 understand the fact that they want to sell you more but I wasn't looking for that. I had to tell her
 several times my situation and told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor or manager of some sort.
 She tried really hard to keep me on the line until I told her to tell me with a simple yes or no if she
 could transfer me to a supervisor. She said she had to write some notes and after doing so she sent
 me to another department although I was in the correct one from the start, the BILLING department. I
 was answered by another lady whom I told my situation and ended up not being the supervisor so I
 had to ask her to send me to a supervisor and she did so without a problem. I got transferred to the
 supervisor and he was rather rude from the start. I told him about my situation and he said he
 understood. I told him exactly what I have written above and apart from being rude, he was being
 condescending and trying to treat me like I was not only inferior but somehow dumb. The service from
 this person was horrible from the start. He tried telling me that he could lower my net but that it would
 remain at the same rate it was on my bill which I found quite rather ridiculous and like I said above he
 was treating me like an inept person. When I asked him for his name he responded with silence so I
 couldn't get that from him. He told me that the supposed promotion had ended which I doubt because
 it wasn't even 30 days since I last talked with someone for that specific promotion. He was silent most
 of the time when I told him that it was an error on their end and not mines. He pretty much said I
 would have to take legal action for him to see my conversation which I also found unreasonable. In
 any case, he told me that he had nothing about that promotion being accepted on April 12, 2015 and I
 responded by telling him that it would be illogical not to accept something lower especially if I would
 be paying less apart from having asked for something like that. I asked to speak to someone higher
 than him and he said that there was absolutely no one else I could speak to that was a higher tier
 than himself. I was so frustrated by that point that I told him I had horrible service from them and that I
 would look for another company for the service since he wasn't fixing the error they had made on their
 end.
 This hasn't been the only incident to have happened. Many times I have asked for promotions to then
 be told they don't have any when I clearly know they do from friends and family members that get
 better service for a lower price in the same exact zip code meaning the same exact area for the
 promotions. I find it rather illogical to treat customers so badly, wasting their time and at the same
 time increasing their bill or not lowering it for loyal customers but that is a whole other case. I am
 making this complaint solely because I am beyond frustrated and upset that now I have this rather
 large bill to pay when I shouldn't be and spending hours upon hours on the phone for then people to
 just ignore, hang-up or transfer you to another department from this company called Comcast.
 As I type this and fill this form out, the address bar reminded me of another ongoing issue that I have
 with them. It is absurd due to the simple fact that they also have my address wrong on their bill and
 system yet I receive their service at the correct address. I have told them at least a dozen times and
 every single time I talk to them they either tell me they changed it or transfer me to another
 department and lately have told me to go to one of their centers to change it although this was also
 another error on their part. What I don't understand is how they are giving me the service to the
 correct address while having the incorrect one on file."
860,"On June 15 2015 I spent a large amount of time with Comcast service representatives on the subject of reducing my bill. An agreement was reached where I had to take phone service that I didn't want, but it came with a much reduce cost and similar other services like TV and internet. I received a confirmation email validating this transaction. I still have the original email copy and can easily provide this if needed.
 Suddenly two days later, I got ANOTHER email from Comcast with a completely different cost breakdown, much more expensive than what I had to begin with and objected to. Comcast refuses to honor the better deal negotiated on June 15. Since this involves internet as well as TV, I've filed this complaint also under the 'TV' heading.

861,"In lieu of providing my SSN to an Internet provider (Comcast), I opted to put a security deposit down, which was on multiple occasions told to me that it would be refunded to my credit card after 6 months of on-time payments. It was charged and posted on 8/5/2014 to my credit card. That day I put a note six months later on my personal calendar to make sure it was refunded after the six months. As it was, it took nearly two full months to actually get service after I put down the deposit. Due to a technical glitch on their end, the automatic payments did not process on time, so the first payment did not go through automatically. As a result, I was informed that the ""6 month clock"" was reset in December of 2014. About a month and a half ago I was informed that with the next statement I would reach the sixth month and see a refund to the initial credit card that the deposit was put on. I called on June 24, 2015 at 2:58 pm to find out why I still had not received the refund to my credit card. It was then that I was told that it is Comcast's policy to wait 12 months of on-time payments, not six. This is the first time I had ever heard about a 12-month wait. Speaking both to the initial customer service rep and her manager, they both said it was 12 months and that I would have to wait until December 28th, 2015, nearly 1.5 years after I provided the deposit to get my 6-month deposit back. At this time, I was also informed that it would not be credited to my credit card, but as a credit to my account. If I want to get it credited to my card, I will have to call back once there is a zero balance at the end of December. Furthermore, I asked for a written letter or email or some other documentation that would guarantee that they would not change their word again come December 2015 and the customer service rep refused. I have repeatedly been lied to about my deposit and the timing for its return. Consistently, many different reps all said it was a six-month wait and come the fulfillment of the hoops they made me jump through to get it back, I find out I have to wait another 6 months. This is deceitful and shameful practice of Comcast's. They do not take any responsibility for what they promise their customers.

862,"I've been a customer of Comcast since TimeWarner owned the area in which I live, almost 10 years
 to date. I've always chosen their service due to reliability, speed, and price. The only other provider
 in my area offers a slow DSL (18Mbps) service which is too slow for my needs.
 Last year, Comcast started to implement a Data Cap in my area. They don't want it referred to as a
 Cap but it is nonetheless (If you have to pay to obtain 'more' then they are 'capping' you!) I feel that
 the data caps they've instituted are due to people like me who are cord cutters. I don't want television
 service as it doesn't fit what I desire out of a media provider. I only want less than 10% of the
 channels they offer and do not want to be held to their time schedule.
 I've really looked at their data cap and I've ran some math against it to see what I'm actually getting
 for what I pay for. In my area I'm paying $78.95 for their Internet Plus with Blast!. I get up to 50Mbps
 down and up to 10Mbps up. Now, I know, most wouldn't utilize 100% of their bandwidth at all times.
 So, for my math, I'll take it at 50% of the speed I pay for, 25Mbps\5Mbps.
 To set this up we'll use a 30day period or 1 month as their meters are setup for. Within a 30day
 period, at 25Mbps, one can download almost 8TB of data IF the speed were constant during that
 period. 300GB is ONLY about 4% of 8TB. So if I were to use half of what I pay for, including their
 overage fees, I'd pay around $1650 a month! But, since I've stayed within their data caps, I've only
 received 4% of what I pay for!
 I actually used up to about 2TB of data a month before they started capping me. My family does all
 media from streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, youtube, etc. I'm aggravated, as a consumer,
 that I'm being ripped off in such a fashion. There isn't a logical or logistical reason that Comcast has
 been able to offer as to why they started the caps. Add, that in these trial markets, there isn't a way
 for my to communicate my issues. I've called and their customer service reps have told me there isn't
 someone, or somewhere, to which I can make a complaint about this issue. Considering I'm ""beta""
 testing this, how do they know what their customers view is on it at all?!
 I fully feel that they've done so to attempt to recover lost revenue for users who are cord-cutters such
 as myself. I fully understand one cannot hold them accountable for the full, up to, speed for which
 they pay. But I still get a small faction of half of what I pay for and I feel something needs to be done.
 They need to end their data caps once and for all."
863,"Unfair data caps for specific market areas that are in no way justified and target a very select markets that have almost no choice other than DSL.
 Since the Data Cap has come to my area I have gone over the cap several times and have been charged for every 50GB over their ""data threshold"". In markets where there is actual competition and not just DSL there is no such practice and Comcast's action shows just how much of a monopoly they have over a large portion of internet users.
 On top of all of this they decided to increase the bill due to increase costs of operations when they just recently spent tens of millions over a failed merger that would have been detrimental to internet users in our nation as a whole.
 I plan to get rid of Comcast within the next month or two even if it means receiving less than half the speed I have now. I'm sick of their data threshold and I'm especially sick of the spam mail they send me trying to get me signed up for their other services.

864,"I had a business internet contract with Comcast. I had to move to a new location and I tried to move our service to the new location. when I called Comcast they told me they could not service the area and I had 2 options I could wait on the to do a survey and install services which would take up to 6 months or I could cancel my contract. I choose to cancel the contract.. they continued to bill me for the next 8 months. So now when I call they tell me that they can service the area and that I am going to be stuck in my contract and can not cancel. They have admitted they can not service the area and have even emailed me the same. but they want me to pay them the remaining amount on my contract which is around 7,000 dollars. They are not even providing us any service? I have been email my account manager for a few months now and he will not do anything or even respond to me about the issue.

866,"Recently I called Comcast to question why I was being billed for Comcast TV and I was advised I had to have Comcat TV service for my internet to work. So when I continued to question reading exactly what my bill stated the person named ,Trip, at Comcast said his supervisor said the wording on the bill was incorrect and the wording would be corrected on my next bill. Which I found strange. So when I questioned this statement I was referred to Tony in resolutions. He confirmed I had been billed for almost a year for the $10.00 per month for TV services. He said that sometimes TV services are added to a bundle and the customer gets a cheaper rate. This is not a true statement. I have never called to change to TV services as I have Direct TV and have for years. I wonder if they keyed my number by mistake as I never requested TV services from Comcast. This appears to be misleading to a customer when the Comcast representative states you must have Comcast TV services to have Comcast Internet services. I would like an adjustment for the almost one year I have been billed the $10.00 per month for the service I was mislead into keeping by being told ""you have to have XFINITY TV services for your internet to work. Supposedly per Tony in billing resolutions my bill will now be $88.95 per month. That is $16.90 less than I am currently being billed. I have been overcharged and mislead by Comcast for a year. What a shame they don't value a customer. I would like and adjust for the misleading overcharges for almost 1 year. Comcast account # Houston, Tx 77049

867,"I called 1-800-comcast; I just got off the phone with comcast for internet connectivity issues and the technical support rep told me that I would receive credit for not having internet access because the modem was no good. He also brought it to my attention that our promotion which we are currently on will be expiring on April 25, 2015. He offered me the exact services that I am receiving for $132.96 with taxes and fees included but it would include phone service. I insisted I did not want phone service and asked him to find me a double play promotion. He could not offer me anything under the double play promotion that would be less than the triple play promotion of $132.96. He then said he would need to transfer me to Comcast loyalty department to receive better rates. When transferred to the loyalty department I got Stephanie (operator ID: M$9). She was very rude and offered me the same triple play bundle for more than the tech support was offering me and did not include ""Blast"" internet service, HBO, Showtime, service protection plan, modem fee, and addt adapter fees. When I told her I wanted to find a bundle that included everything which I currently have; she very rudely replied ""but your not paying for it you receiving it as service discounts"". I told her whether im paying for it or not I want to continue to receive the same sand I was transferred to you department by technical support because they said you'd be able to offer me the exact same services for a better price. She then laughed and whispered something to someone else in the background and said, ""then your gonna have to talk to that guy"". She continued to talk over me, very rude, and disrespectful. So, I tell hell I don't want a contact and right now we do not have a contract. She then says that if I don't want a contract there would be an additional $10 fee. She continued to laugh with someone in the background regarding my bill and me wanting free services. Finally, I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said I was going to be put on an extended hold. She would pick up the phone and very sarcastically say, Hello, ma'am, I'm just making sure you're still holding. Finally I got a supervisor, Mark (operator ID: FUO) answers and basically tells me exactly what the previous rep told me. Then explained to me that the tech rep I was speaking with is with a third party and that he would send him an email asking him to contact me with his first offer. I told him that I felt like they were using a tactic which will basically push me to accept the first offer and that if they work directly with comcast why could they not offer me something better that a third party vendor. On top of all the trouble they put me through and wasted time; they said I would need to contact tech support after my modem is replaced to receive any type of credit for the internet service. I feel that they know that they are the only company in this are offering cable services and bully you into accepting these ridiculous fees. We have been customers of their for over 10 years and there is no gratitude or appreciation. The only choice I have in order to stop the abuse is by discontinuing my services which cannot do because AT&T does not provide service in this are and internet in this fast paced technological world is a must have especially when you work from home and have 8 children relying on the internet for school and other educational purposes. We have always had crappy service with comcast cable and internet but have always accepted that they are the only one offering service in this area."

869,"Comcast added a $4.99/month fee to my monthly bill in October 2014 (I think this is when it was added—I had to dig back through my online bill statements to try to find when it appeared). The fee is for a ""Service Protection Plan"". I've attached the relevant page from Comcast's website explaining the Service Protection Plan (http://www.comcast.com/spp/), with added highlighting for the relevant advertised services.
 Comcast is within its rights to change billing without notifying customers. I'm expected to check my statement every month to make sure everything looks right. That isn't the issue here. The issue is that despite charging me for this service since November, Comcast refused to offer me support covered by this service in January.
 I started having intermittent connectivity issues in November. I was gone most of December, and when I got back in January I was still experiencing problems with my modem finding no signal on the line several times a week.
 I called Comcast's technical support to ask them to check the line to my apartment. The service advertises being supported by a ""local service representative"", but I was obviously connected to a call center in South Asia every time I called the support number. I tried calling several times over the space of the month when I experienced issues to see if the tech could diagnose the line issue. Every time I called, the tech insisted that there was no problem on their end, and that it was a problem with my device. They explained that since I owned my own modem, it was not supported, and I needed to buy a new one.
 I finally gave in and bought a new modem, which did not resolve the problem. At this point the Comcast support tech finally agreed that it was probably a line problem, and scheduled a tech to come out and look at the line. He specifically said that he would ""waive the service call fee"" since I'd been experiencing the issue for so long with no resolution.
 When the tech got here, he measured the line noise with his equipment and installed a filter on my line in the service box on the outside of my apartment. This resolved my connectivity problem.
 Today (April 27, 2015), I discovered the ""Service Protection Plan"" charge on my monthly bill. When I read what this covers, I was very upset to discover that I'd been paying for ""hassle-free service resolution"" for issues with ""customer owned equipment"" since October 2014. This Service Protection Plan is advertised to specifically cover issues with customer-owned equipment; however, the fact that I owned my own equipment was the exact reason the Comcast techs refused to send a technician out for a service call.
 I spoke with a Comcast customer loyalty representative today, and he insisted that the ""Service Protection Plan"" was fulfilled as advertised since I was not charged for the service call when the technician installed the filter. (This contradicted what the technician who set the appointment said, since he said he was ""waiving"" the fee due to the fact that I'd been having connection problems for over a month.) He said the best he could do is remove the service from my account, and give me a $4.99 credit (for one month of the service).
 In summary, Comcast added a ""Service Protection Plan"" to my bill without confirming that I wanted the service. Comcast then refused to offer the services guaranteed by the ""Service Protection Plan"" on the basis that I owned my own equipment, which is specifically been covered by the ""Service Protection Plan"".
 I believe I am due a full refund for the ""Service Protection Plan"" since Comcast actively refused to fulfill their advertised guarantees related to this service.
 I also hope that the FCC will follow up on this issue. I doubt that I am the only Comcast customer who has been unknowingly charged for the ""Service Protection Plan"", but then refused the services guaranteed by that plan.

871,"I have business-class internet service at my house. I've had business-class service for 5+ years. I just
 signed a new contract for business-class service in January for 2 years.
 In late 2014 there were numerous outages to my service. Comcast sent out a technician to replace
 the modem for the service. The technician attempted to upgrade the modem to the current class of
 device. The technician was unable to get the new modem working with my static IP addresses. He
 came back the next day with a used modem similar to the one I already had. He told me that model
 (the SMC modem) was very hard to get. He put it in service and was able to configure it correctly.
 Since then I've similar outage patterns to those I saw that prompted the modem replacement. This
 week alone we've had several instances of the service dropping for periods of 10 and 20 minutes.
 When I check the Comcast website it shows no outage in my area. Frequently the only solution to the
 localized outage is to unplug the modem (as suggested by Comcast), wait 5 seconds and plug it in
 again. This does solve the problem but it seems like an unreasonable long-term solution.
 I called Comcast earlier this afternoon to complain about the latest outage. I asked them to come out
 and replace the modem with the newer model. The phone representative told me they could send a
 technician but there was a possibility of service charge of $99.95 for the trip. The technician would be
 the sole arbiter as to whether the charge would be applied.
 The modem replacement in late 2014 was the third or fourth time the modem has been replaced for
 similar problems.
 I would like for Comcast to come out to my house, replace the modem with a reliable device and take
 reasonable steps towards ensuring these persistent, periodic outages cease."
872,"I have repeatedly called Comcast/Xfinity over the past year about my bill. I see that new customer
 get a bill 100 dollars less than I pay for bundled services and I get no such discount. I've been with
 them over 20 years. I've finally decided to just try to tough it out, I work at home and I have no
 choice but to have the internet. I called in today trying to adjust payment times because my budget is
 tight, I'm a single mother and was told I had to pay 433 dollar today (I had charges from someone
 elses account added to mine and they were NEVER removed) they would disconnect my services. I
 was only asking to have them allow me until a day BEFORE the day listed on their site to pay what
 was owed. I asked to make a payment on June 5th, the site says June 6th, she said no you can't do
 that. When I asked to speak to retention, the young lady, Heather, refused and said they would only
 transfer me back to her but they could make a payment arrangement (which is what I asked for),
 THEN she said she could make a payment arrangement for me but could only do it for 7 days.
 Everytime you talk to them the story changes and my bill is still super high every month. Again I pay
 DOUBLE almost triple what the new customer pay and they will not put me on any of the new plans at
 all. I am also still being told and sometimes billed for equipment I do not have. I keep telling them I
 never had a separate router, other than my own and they insist I did and still have it. I do not. If I
 could leave them I would, but as I'm stuck, I really wish they'd be more kind to their longer standing
 customers."
873,"I pay for 50mbps down 30up and right now i am receiving 7.59 mbps down and 11.19 up this is a
 constant problem which Comcast/Xfinity has not resolved. I cannot run my business this way. Please
 advise.

874,"I've been with comcast for some years and I have always had problems with them they are the only
 cable provider in this area. Each time I call customer service its a headache nobody knows what to do
 and reps seem to not know what the last rep told or service that was provided for you reps tell you
 anything and when you ask for a manger for help they refuse. I am so frustrated with Comcast and
 this time decided to do something about it. I called in April 2015 and ask how can I lower my bill it
 goes up every moth although I am not making any changes to my account. The rep told me if I sign
 up for Cable/Internet/Phone my bill will be around 119 a month a reduction from the usual 155 I pay.
 My phone service never got turned on and I got billed for it not as a package but separate I got bill as
 a package and the separate for each service I also was told I will more channels in HD with this
 package and free Showtime and HBO for a year I already had HBO so he said it be extended I called
 to tell CSR that Showtime was not working I was told oh you have to pay for it I said Rep just told me
 yesterday free for a year new rep said I don't see that I said work order was just placed it included a
 home phone and more HD channels and Free Showtime for a year she said I don't see a order for
 that. After fussing she said well I will do 3 months that it and add a phone service for you give it a
 week to go into effect. I said I already did everything she said I cant tell what other reps did I can only
 see what I do we don't see other reps work orders. So I got a bill for over 200 dollars no phone no
 free showtime for a year and no additional HD channels and it will cost 50.00 for a tech to come to my
 home cause I dont have phone service i said I am paying that extra 3.99 for home service and it was
 removed without my permission I didn't realize they took it off I am sure so I can get charged for a
 tech if I have a problem instead of 3.99 a month 50.00 each call out for a tech. I thought maybe going
 online would yield better results but chat rep log out on me without warning. Comcast never delivers
 on its service they lie to customers and issues are never resolved and when you ask for a manager
 they refuse to connect you what they do is put you back into the automated system or transfer you to
 another rep blindly. Antenna TV is looking really good now and that money I can put in my bank
 account instead of Comcast CEO who clearly does not care about its customers. Over $2000 extra
 by end of year in my account instead of Comcast is really nice. Fix my problems Comcast or I walk."
875,"Recently became a customer to Comcast.The issue I am experiencing revolves a very simple subject that Comcast insists on turning into an enigma.My service was install on the 9th day of February.Taking into account the fact that billing revolve around a 30 cycle. I expected my bills to arrive on or around the 9th of every month.However, to my surprise the initial bill was due on the 2nd of the following month.At which point I contacted comcast to change the due date to the 5th of every month. Comcast replied by doing the opposite,the date was changed but in the opposite direction. I have contacted comcast about the issue several, but without any result.Now, while such problem may not appear much,for me it makes a whole lot of difference taking into account the fact I am disable and my form of income is social security. Which I receive the third of every month.

877,"To Whom It May Concern:
 Comcast bills each month for services renders. The questionable business practice of billing the customer for late payments (paid online) and then Comcast states they received a request for paperless billing when in fact no such request was presented by the customer. Next, after Comcast have received a $35 late fee for the so called last due payment, Comcast offers an option for paper billing for each months' bill mailed out. But if the customer decides not to take the offer of paperless bill then the customer is billed a late fee and an additional $1 to start paper billing. The agreement with Comcast states nothing about the interchange between paper and paperless bill until Comcast states they did not receive payment on the due date and a late fee is assessed.
 Please request Xfinity/Comcast Internet services to discontinue the practice of charging a late fee for profit when Comcast did not send a paper bill or e-mail bill until after the due date. Thanks.

881,"Comcast over a period of 5 months miss billed my account for equipment I did not have. The issues started after their system miss identified equipment that was never on my account. I have to call/web chat with them 5 separate times to deal with the issue every month a new bill came in. Every time the agent told me it was fixed then I was again miss charged.
 What is super confusing about the issue is I never had this equipment on my account so for it to randomly show up then struggle to get it removed was a major issue. It finally got resolved but not after hours of my time convincing multiple people that equipment I imagine is being used by another account is not on my account.
 I am not sure why cable companies continue to get away with poor support in all aspects of their business. The monopoly system used in America is truly hurting Americans.

882,"Comcast refuses to bring my price down if I try to cancel my television subscription. They actually inreverse try to raise my price for canceling my tv subscription and staying with just Internet. That's absoultly insane. They even taunt me and tell me no one else is going to give me the speeds they give me. Sadly they are right. They are basically the only provider for fast internet in my area. They can be the way they are because they know I have no choice. They also throttle my internet during the evening time. Causing my Internet to go desperately slow.

883,"Comcast prices increases bill if you remove cable from an internet plan.
 Internet individually is $75, while Internet+Cable is priced at $70. I have spent significant time with their support and get the same story: Removing Cable will increase my bill.
 Comcast does this to artificially inflate cable user accounts to get more money from cable content providers and advertisers.
 This practice not only is not intuitive to users, it is actively harming them by not giving an option to cut costs through eliminating services they are not using.
 I have no other broadband service provider in my area, so I am relying on FCC to prevent these predatory/monopolistic practices and defend me as a consumer.

884,"I believe that Comcast is charging me too much. I am a college student on budget and cannot afford this $64 a month that becomes to $80 a month bill. I do not want tv. I would like only internet but since I will be paying more for only internet, I have to keep tv. Originally I was paying $40-something a month, which I feel was a good price, but then my bill has gone up in excess.

885,"i have a complaint about the pricing and speed of my internet service. I'm currently paying $57.81 per month for download speeds of 300kb/s, it seems outrageous for me to pay such a high monthly amount for such a low speed. Especially since it's the only ISP in my area with the exclusion of AT&T but they only offer Dial up speeds at a similar price point. The price is way too high for such low speeds, not to mention the constant outages I experience or slowdown to where I'm not receiving the promised speed.

 1) My internet speed varies from 25 Mbps down to 2 Mbps downstream. I am paying for the 25 Mbps service (Performance Internet) but the speed is often a magnitude lower.
 2) My bill is overcharged. I should be in a promotional offer at $39.99/month but the latest bill is in the $70 ballpark.

I experience my internet having connectivity issues everyday around 3pm CST. Every time I call there is a different reason surrounding my connectivity issues. They have blamed it on the signal, the equipment, and the microwave. I wonder when I was going into the office everyday if the service was working then? I have no confidence in their service and because they are a monopoly in my apartment complex it leaves me with little choice of other internet service providers. While a nice bill would be a great outcome, consistent service is what I really want.

890,"I am filing a compliant against comcast. My name is Aishya Johnson and my account number is Account: . I am filing a complaint because I have unburied cords from when Comcast connected my cable that were supposed to be buried. They had technicians come and still did not bury all of the cable wires. I have faulty service because of this issue. In addition, there have been several occasions where I have made payment arrangements with Comcast and have paid my bil and yet my services have literally been disconnected 3 times in a week and I have had to call Comcast and listen to them lie and tell it was a glitch or an error and that they were going to get it fixed. Only for my services to be disconnected again the next day. In addition, I had a past due bill that I was supposed to pay or make arrangements to pay by June 7th before interruption. I called on June 4th and made arrangements that I was told was put in the system and gave them my credit card information for the payment to automatically draft and they disconnected my services on June 6th and forced me to make arrangements to pay two payments before they would turn on my services again. I made those arrangements to the 6th to make a payment on June 12th and June 25th. On June 8th after those arrangements were made, my services were disconnected. I called and they told me that was an error. Keep in mind that ever time they interrupt my services they are charging me a fee and not correcting it. The on June 10th, my services were interrupted again by Comcast and I was charged another fee eventhough i was told on the 8th that this was a glitch in the system and it was corrected. Then on June 12th after they drafted $85 out of my account, my services were interrupted again and I was charged another interruption fee and then they told me that they could give me a $3 adjust eventhough I have faulty service due to unburied cords in my backyard and I made arrangements and the funds were drafted from my account. I have been charged over $85 in disconnect fees and not one time has a technician showed up to bury the cables or address the internet issues that I have due to the unburied cables. Every time i have set p a payment arrangement with Comcast, I have not started to realized that they are not putting the payment arrangement in on purpose because they they can charge me a late fee and a disconnection fee when they interrupt my services eventhough I have made arrangements to pay or have actually already pay for this horrible service. I have tried to call the corporate office and to talk to supervisors all to no avail. No one with this company is willing to address any of these issues or even address the fact that because they left a safety hazard in my backyard, my son cannot even go out side to play because of this wires.

894,"Consumer contacted Comcast on 06/22/2015 to start cable and internet service. The representative said she could do a self-install and the boxes are wireless so she did not need coaxial cords. Whenever she received the boxes, they required wiring. She contacted Comcast and they said they would send a technician out for free on 06/27/2015 at 1:00pm. She contacted Comcast when no one showed up and the representative said to wait another hour. She waited a few more hours and contacted Comcast back again when no one came. That representative said an appointment was never set up and she would have to call a different number to set up the appointment. At that point she was so frustrated she wanted to cancel. She was sent to another representative who said not to cancel and they would have a representative out on 06/27/2015 by 5:00pm. She called Comcast the next day and they said a technician would not be out until 07/04/2015. When she told the technician how poor the service was he hung up on her. As a resolution, she would like Comcast to send a technician out to install services in a timely manner or cancel the services all together. ***CTR359-phone***

895,"I am a Comcast customer because they are the only internet provider in my area that offers the internet speeds that I need to stream lectures for school. Comcast has a history of monopolizing their prices and Houston Texas is no different. A year ago I was offered the promotional rate of 55.00 for cable TV and internet. I do not ever use cable TV, and do not ever plan to use it. I took this deal because it was less expensive to get the combination than it was to get only internet at the speeds I need. Comcast is inflating the number of their cable ""users"" by offering the internet packages bundled with cable for a lower rate than simply internet. The promotional year has past and to continue the same level of service my bill would be 70.00. This is another promotional rate, still bundled with cable. The cost of just internet at the same speed is 78.00 but you are required to also subscribe to digital TV or digital voice. The least expensive extra service increases my bill by 20.00. These extra services are of no value to me. There is no way to purchase just internet at the speed that I want. What Comcast is doing is not right. They are requiring that I bundle useless services and pay more for them when all I want is one service and I should be paying less for the single service that I want. Comcast can manipulate their customers this way because they are the only providor in the area offering the faster internet speeds. They should not be allowed to do this.

When I call and talk to someone from Comcast and we agree on something or a new plan...they never follow through with what they say they are going to do. They tell me they will make me happy by giving me what I want and then do something else, which makes me have to call back and explain what I talked about the last time I called. I should just talk to a wall. Comcast is raping America and they need to be stopped!!!

899,"I have been a Comcast customer for approximately one year. Upon my promotional rate for TV and Internet expiring, I received a phone call from someone claiming to be a member of the Comcast Promotions Department on Wednesday, June 10. After some discussion, I was told that a new promotion was available to me which would double my internet speed, provide a phone number with unlimited long distance, and add Starz to my existing channel lineup. I was informed that my bill would increase to $169/month, and that price was locked in for 12 months with a 12 month service agreement. In order to receive the phone line, I also needed to pay a one time fee of $9.95 to have a new internet modem sent to me. I agreed to these terms via a ""third-party verification service"" using responses to an automated system. The next morning, June 11th, I received an e-mail from online.communications@alerts.comcast.net confirming my order. This email included order details which were drastically different from what I was told over the phone. For starters, the email stated that the rate was $181/month which was $12/month more that I was quoted. Additionally, that price was only available for 6 months before going up an additional $5/month. Also, the service agreement term was stated in the email as 24 months instead of the 12 I was told over the phone. On the same day, I contacted Comcast to explain the above story. They merely offered to cancel the order. I clearly stated that I did not need nor did I want to receive the new wireless gateway. I was told that it would not be shipped. This morning, June 13, I received an email from Comcast stating that my new wireless gateway was in the mail and would be received wishing the next few business days. Again, I contacted Comcast and states that I specifically did not want to receive it and was assured it would not be shipped earlier in the week. I was told ""sorry"" you can put a return label on it and drop it off at a UPS store. I stated that I had no responsibility to go out of my way to return what I now deem to be unsolicited mail. I was then offered to receive a follow up phone call on Monday after scheduled delivery, so that I can set up a time for a service agent to pick it up if Inwould not take it back to the UPS store. This whole process has been filed with lies, deceptive business practices, and significant inconvience to me, the consumer.

I HAD A $33.39 INCREASE ON MY INTERNET BILL FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 2015
 TODAY I TALKED WITH KIMBERLY CUSTOMER SVCS. SHE SAID THAT THEY HAD CREDIT ME $11.91 AND AFTER THEY REMOVE THE $1 FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET MY BILL WILL STILL BE $87.22.

I was getting 6mb per sec. with the promotion of $29.99 for 1 yr. it was for high speeds of $105mb per sec. After talking with Comcast Sophia, she went and gave me the Economy Plus package for 3 to 6 mn for $39.95, plus services & taxes for $57.00 a month. After discussing the April 2015 bill of $87.22 and the increases, she said I would only pay $57.71 for the month of April 2015 and that my monthly bill would be and even $57.00 (OF COURSE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME). that's with the taxes, & the additional services added. If the 3 to 6mb is too slow to stream my Netflix movies she said for me to call them back and let them know that it is too slow.
 I agreed to that because $87.22 for an Performance Internet Package is too expensive for me for 105mb per sec.
 If Comcast ""Promotion was running $29.99 for 1 yr. the Performance package plus $3.99, $8.00.
 How is it that I'm paying $29.95 for the promotion bill, plus $3.99 & $8.00 in March 14, 0f 2014 for additional services and when you look at my bill -

 XFinity for $47.99 instead of $29.95 (the promotional amount) 08/20/14 the XFinity Internet was $47.99 instead of $29.95. Sept 20, 2014 Xfinity was $47.99 instead of the $29.95 Oct. 20, 2014 XFinity was $51.99 in stead of $29.95
 The total amounts were not added in. I will have to fax these statements to you so that you will see how Comcast really treat its customers. Please send me a FAXNo. so that you can see how they have been billing me on there ""High Speed Performance Package for a year for a cost of $29.95 a month plus service packages & taxes. I will fax front and back copies to you. Its a travesty to see and know as well as myself and other customers has gone through so much anguish. Please view these billing statements which are so wrong. You just gets tried of fighting with these companies and the keep adding ""OTHER CHARGES"" in cents. What do other charges means ""ANYTHING THEY WANT TO CHARGE TO YOU!!!
 BEFORE I GOT THE PROMOTION FOR HIGH SPEED PERFORMANCE I WAS PAYING $39.99 A MONTH FOR 6MB OF SPEED. NOW ITS $77.04 FOR PERFORMANCE HIGH SPEED OF 105MB. I WAS TOLD IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL $12.00 TO GET THIS AND YOUR BILL WILL BE $87.22 FOR 105MB PLUS TAXES & ETC. THEY HAVE LOST IT AT COMCAST!!!!

903,"After signing up with comcast, they asked me to sign up for e-billing. After I signed up for e-billing they refused to give me access to my e-bill unless I used my ""pin"", which I haven't received. When I reported the problem via chat, they said they didn't need any of my information and could bypass the security checks because I was signed into my account. Then they said they can't help me other than re-send the pin, which will arrive after the due date of my bill. They again refused to allow access to my e-bill and at one point in the conversation they expected me to pay without seeing my bill. I expressed my frustration in them not being able to help a new customer and ended the chat. Immediately upon completing the chat, they reset my router and had no access to internet. It came back on some time later and then once again my router was reset. I'm assuming that this was done on purpose to get back at me for voicing my frustration with their customer service and I write this in fear that they may again cut the service for which I'm paying (intend/want to) for. This is unacceptable service and not what I signed up for.

906,"Attached is a transcript of the chat conversation that was had with two Comcast CSAs. I had to
 escalate the contact since Comcast was charging $40 for a service call that was required to fix an
 error done by a previous technician. Apparently the previous technician ""coded"" the call as non-fault
 to Comcast.
 This is intensely absurd, since the error was a previous tech using a powered amplifier/splitter for the
 apartment building, and had my neighbor be responsible for keeping the splitter powered. When the
 neighbor (who I have never met, or know) unplugged the splitter's power supply, it took my
 connection out with it. Supposedly, this is my fault and I should eat the $40 for having to get Comcast
 to fix it.
 Several times over, I was told I would need to pay this $40 fee, with the explanation that it was ""non-
 Comcast"" related.
 When pressing the manager/member of leadership at the end, this followed:
 Zachariah_ > I'll assume you read above, but the main issue was a previous tech having a powered
 amplifier/splitter, and then that powered amplifier was plugged into an outlet in another tenant's
 apartment. That tenant then unplugged the amplifier, shutting off my service. The initial mistake was
 the previous Comcast technician using a powered splitter in that way. That mistake, in combination
 with the neighbor unplugging it, meant I had no service. I will not accept half of the $40, because this
 is not even half of my fault.
 Zachariah_ > I'm sorry to sound curt... but I've been in this chat for at least 30 minutes at this point
 Zachariah_ > I run a business, and this is not how a company who claims to be customer-centric acts,
 at all.
 Zachariah_ > A $40 service charge would make perfect sense if this was an issue I could fix myself.
 Tell me, could I have fixed this myself?
 Cathelyn > That is alright, Zachariah. I truly understand your concern. Let me go ahead and check
 with my resources if we can waive the whole amount for the Trouble Call charge of $40. Will it be
 alright if you can give me 2-3 minutes while I work on your credit request?"
907,"Comcast has throttled speeds without notice, also I was told I would not be charged a wireless gateway due to being a ""valued customer"", was contacted by their sales department multiple times and was told I had xfinity blast speeds of 105mbps+. When in all actually I was paying for performance 25mbps. Conducted test and it was actually being produced at 6 mbps. Asked to speak with multiple supervisors and the answer every time was that they do not have any managerial staff.

908,"I have recently purchased a house have multiple options for cable and internet at my new home. I want to cancel my Comcast because they raised my bill last month. I am not locked into any sort of contract and should be able to cancel my current service without penalty. I have been attempting to contact someone in the cancellation department for 3 days now. The automated phone system hangs up on me every time I select the options that I want and enter my information (phone number on account, last 4 of social). This has happened to me at least ten times. I sent an email to the corporate we_can_help@cable.comcast.com explaining my issues. I received an phone call and email from one of their ""Executive Customer Relations"" personnel. I missed the initial phone call but tried to call back using the number given to me in the email. I left a message with call back information, and tried calling multiple times yesterday and today during the business hours specified in the email. I have still yet to get in touch with anyone and am about to start a new monthly billing cycle for a service that I do not want and am unable to cancel. The complete lack of any sort of customer service has just confirmed my choice to move to another provider for my cable and internet. Someone needs to get in touch with me from Comcast immediately before I get billed for another month of service that I currently cannot even use.

909,"As a Comcast customer, I am subject to a total data transfer limit of 300 GB per month. This is easy
 to surpass without much effort, thanks to a combination of Netflix and my Playstation 4.
 This data limit is anti-consumer (it keeps me from using Backblaze to keep a safe copy of all my data
 offsite, for example) and limits what I can do with my internet connection.
 I would switch to an alternative provider, but no high-speed alternative exists in my neighborhood
 and, as far as I know, no provider has plans to expand into my neighborhood.
 I live in a reasonably affluent part of a major metropolitan area. I should be able to choose my internet
 provider, shouldn't I?"
910,"There are rules set in place to keep providers from blocking content that is lawful on the internet, yet Comcast is still blocking HBOGO on my PS4 which I have paid for both. I only subscribed to HBOGO
 to watch on my console and am now not allowed to by Comcast. Surely something will be done to fix
 this soon. Comcast is not above the regulations that ALL other providers follow."
911,"I am currently paying for 105mbps. However, for the past ~6 months my speed has been reduced to less than 5mbps during peak hours (6pm-12am). Multiple Comcast technicians have come to my home and found no fault in my equipment or signal. In addition it appears the entire neighborhood is being throttled as evidenced by a multitude of posts on the community Facebook group.

912,"I have a triple play bundle (cable, internet, and phone). I called to cancel my cable and just keep internet and phone because they raised the yearly price because the ""promotion"" i was on has expired. The customer service rep, Patrick, told me that it would actually be more expensive to just have internet and phone. So he found another triple play bundle that would upgrade my service in a 24 month agreement of $159.99 plus tax. I asked him several times if there were going to be any extra fees, specifically modem rental. He told me 3 DIFFERENT TIMES that it was all included in the bundle and there would be no extra fees. So i agreed to upgrade my service. I received an email with a summary of my services and billing for the agreed upon upgrade and I see ""Additional Xfinity Internet Services - $10.00"". So i called Comcast and asked what the fee was for and the customer service rep, Joe, told me it was the modem rental fee. The first customer service rep lied to me 3 times by telling me that the modem rental fee was included in the bundle. He made me think that I would be paying less than my previous service. This is not right! They are the only ISP in my neighborhood. This is not the first time they have jacked up the price after a year claiming ""the promotion you were on has ended"". I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years and have not had a late or missed payment.

I pay online and the amount I paid was the amount showed, which I clicked on and then clicked Pay bill. Really, how else could I pay less than they stated. There is no way to adjust the amount.
 I called and got a bunch of double talk and then requested for my original internet and charge to be reinstated. The retention person told me he could continue my service for 1 yr without a contract at the price I was paying for the same service. I specifically stated more than one time, which will show on their recording the advise about, that I wanted NO additional services or speed in internet.
 TODAY on my online account page I noticed under services They added Cable TV to my bill along with some kind of one time fee. I did not request and specifically stated I wanted NO additional services. Instead of adjusting my bill back to the Normal $44.95 and refunding extra charges as the Retention Officer stated the added Services, specifically Cable TV. Didn't have , never had, Don't want and will not pay for. Please follow through to allow Comcast to know their actions are being Monitored .

I have talked to several representatives and two supervisors and no changes have been made! I was told I was not going to be charged an install fee and a tech visit for the many inconveniences and they are still showing on my bill, as well as the two extra devices that I returned, still being charged for that. I have called 14 times, not including the three calls that I was on hold and my call was dropped. I have had to explain myself 14 separate times with nothing being done about it. I am irrate and want this issue resolved. Personally I believe I should have no bill due the 15th for the many inconveniences and be charged only the $133.44/mo that I should be paying right after. No one is helping me and I am very upset! I have had service with Comcast for quite some time and never have I experienced such lack of communication or lack of compassion and understanding concerning these issues I have been experiencing with Comcast. They should be put out of business for price gauging.

920,"I have had numerous issues with comcast with both cable television and internet. One major issue being that for the first two and a half months I didn't have the advertised television service due to the only outlet in that apartment being in a place where having a television would have been a fire hazard and their refusal to install outlets despite that complex saying it was allowed.
 More recently, since moving to my current address, I have not seen my uptime go beyond 36 hours and several unjustified ip address changes. (Comcast uses Static IP address handling based upon Mac Addresses, and my mac address never changed.) I notified the Better Business Bureau of the matter, but received conflicting reports about what is going on with one tech claiming it was line noise and another claiming there is no issue. In addition, techs were sent to my address without any prior notice and when I was at work despite my repeated request for notice to where I had to contact their dispatch myself to set up an appropriate appointment.
 During this time, I also attempted to get Comcast Business with a Static IP address, only for them to try to force me to use their equipment which includes a built in router (they call it a gateway) which would violate a handshake agreement that I have with the makers of the router that I currently use in addition to being very insecure. When I attempted to contact them of the situation, they attempted to bully me about the matter until I outright said that was what they were doing and terminated the order due to said bullying.
 The most aggregious issue is that they have opted to lump in a credit for another issue into this matter, saying it won't be applied until this happens. In addition to a false accusation of the router I'm using being the issue, (which was confirmed by both myself and the makers to not be the case) calling at inappropriate hours, and wasting a considerable amount of time that would go to my day job, I have seen enough issues to where this is unacceptable and needs to be escalated further.

 The following is an update concerning the matter. In their attempt to make things right, Comcast's tech (named Jason Makejew) attempted to bully me into using their wireless gateway that would be a security nightmare again. This is outright unacceptable an I am demanding an immediate apology for not only him disregarding security concerns, but for his uncouth approach.

921,"I was charged a late fee on an account that had auto bill pay set up through Comcast. I was given no notification that there was a problem with the bill pay service prior to the late payment. I was only given notification that the bill was late and a fee was assessed. I then payed the bill and inquired about the problem. I was told the late fee was legitimate and it could not be refunded. The mistake was clearly made by the company since there was an error with the auto payment and I was given no chance to correct the problem prior to the fee being assessed. I then requested cancellation of services and the agent told me that I would have to call another number to do so.

 His most recent issue was calling to get rid of the video service. He called on Saturday and was told
 to call back Monday. He called today (Monday) and was told that he called one day late and if he
 canceled then all of his prices for his services would go up.
 He also has issues with an install fee for him home security system. The technician initially sent
 could not complete the install so they scheduled another one. The next guy did not have the right
 equipment and they had to reschedule. After the third visit it was supposed to be working properly. I
 called them about not wanting video service anymore but they canceled his entire internet. Every
 month he has to call because the install fee keeps reappearing on his bill. He also got an additional
 credit for his inconvenience.
 They also showed up in January and said that he needed new equipment. He was charged for this
 visit without explanation as to why he needed new equipment (he used his own equipment). They
 also refuse to allow his to speak to a supervisor, and they never call back.
 I am also not getting the speeds advertised. They sent a tech out who said he was getting the
 speeds advertised but he would not show me on his device.

 I was contacted by Comcast representative ""Giale?"" and was told that if i disconnect my Video
 service my Xfinity Alarm service contract would be extended. I replied that I was told that my services
 other than securit services has nothing to do with my other services. He stated that i would have to
 extend my contract in order to cancel my video services. I explained how I call within my 30 money
 back grace period. He states again, that it would start my Home Security contract over. I expressed
 how can an Comcast mistake punish me. I did everything I was to do as a customer. He stated to me
 that I had already gotten over 700 dollars in credit and the Comcast had mad their recompense and if
 I change services they were going to either charge me an erilay termination fee or extend mu contract
 for another two years. I stated this was apart off my FCC complaint. He stated he did not see it and
 will not address my concern. I disconnected the call.
 I do not see who Comcast can force someone to extend their contract when each time the error was
 on Comcast behave? The over 700 dollars credit was issued n=by Comcast for their errors. He
 stated the Tech fixed the Video errors and was not going to cancel my Video services without
 extending my Home security contract another two years.

 Furthermore, every time Comcast makes a mistake they want to penalize the customer by extending
 the contract out. The messed up in October, they came out in January telling me I had to extend the
 contract for my Home Security or I would be subject to cancellation fees. I did not make the error
 Comcast did. Why should my contract have to be extended for their errors. I called within the 30 day
 cancellation period. The should not be able to force me to keep their bad video service stating if I
 change the service I would be just to a new contract for two years or cancellation fees. This should be
 criminal!!!

 I to this day have not received a response from Comcast. I believe I have one additional day. I would
 like to speak to the analyst who is governing my Comcast dispute. I just call an spoke with a person
 whom read me the Comcast response. They indicated they made an error in November by
 disconnecting my service. What they did not mention is how they forced me to renew my contract on
 January 3 for a mistake they admitted making. I should not have to renew a contract because of their
 error. Additionally, they speak of a 179.00 credit, that was because they charges me for equipment
 they were not suppose to charge me. I had to call into Comcast a fight to receive that credit. The
 credited my twice for the 99.00 Home security install fee, but is still billing me for the install fee. This
 is a mess on Comcast behalf.

 Comcast needs to do the right thing and stop forcing their customer to may adjustments for their

 the mistakes they would not have to issue credits.

 I have not receive any update on the complaint from Comcast. I would like to know what the status of
 this is please. Thank you!"
924,"Hello. I have been a customer with comcast for several years. I am currently paying over 150 a month
 for internet, cable, and xfinity home protection. I priced out all of these with other companies, and I
 can get all 3 services for around 80-90 a month from different carriers. My contract expired over a
 year ago, as was confirmed by several of their employees when I spoke on the phone. I called
 several times to try to cancel my service with comcast, but supposedly I am still under contract with
 comcast, even though the only document that I have ever signed with comcast, which I have right
 here in my hand, was for a 2 year agreement and was signed in 2012.
 I can not pay that much for services, as I just had a new addition to my family (a baby girl), and I am
 tired of being lied to by their representatives. My wife and I have talked to no less than 17 employees
 at comcast in the last month or so (a total of 3 different calls), all of which had told us something
 different, ranging from , we are so sorry, to your monthly bill has been lowered to 90 a month with free
 channels, to now it has switched to 120, to we can't help you, suck it up, to supervisors refusing to
 speak to me (2 have refused), to telling me that there is a 600 dollar termination fee, etc.
 I have called, personally, on two occasions about this issue, and between the 2 calls, I was on the
 phone between 3-4 hours and was transferred to no less than 9 people, all of them telling me
 something different, and some straight up lying to me by telling me that they are going to do
 something or lower something, and then it never happens. A few have even hung up on me and I had
 to call back. My wife has called about this issue on one occasion, and spoke to no less than 6 people,
 being lied to as well.
 I cannot afford 150 a month for services, and tried to be nice and kind when I called. You think for a
 customer who was willing to try to work things out with comcast that we could be treated better. This
 is my last chance to resolve this. This is for internet, cable, and home security through comcast.
 Thanks.

928,"I have been paying to get an internet speed of 50 bpms. Every couple days, my internet would
 decrease to 0.5-4 bpms. I could get it to increase to 20-30 by sending a refresh signal. Comcast sent
 a tech out since I had no way to hard wire into the modem and he determined that it was not my
 router causing the problem. He noted that some wires were out of place and fixed those, saying that
 should resolve the problem. He mentioned that those wires could have potentially caused the modem
 to fail completely, so if I continued to have issues, I should call back to have them get me a new
 modem. When I called back, they sent another tech out, who again determined that it was not my
 router causing the problem. But, he said that the modem was working, too. He mentioned that there
 was something wrong with the way my account information was entered and that was preventing me
 from reaching the speeds I was paying for. He told me that he would get that taken care of in the next
 24 hours and that his supervisor would follow up with me in the next 24 hours to make sure that the
 problem was solved. The next day, while at work, I missed 2 calls from an automated Comcast
 number and no voice mails were left, so I had no way to return the calls. A couple days later, my
 internet slowed again. I called Comcast to find out if the steps had been taken to resolve the issue the
 tech had mentioned. The person I spoke with kept telling me that they were unable to look at what the
 tech had done, but guaranteed me that the problems I was experiencing were due to the old modem
 that I had- even though the tech told me the modem was working fine. I asked to speak to the
 supervisor. The supervisor told was able to access what the tech had written. He told me that the tech
 wrote that there was a problem with the consumers equipment. He said that means that it was
 probably my router. I asked if there was a way to get in contact with the tech or his supervisor,
 because that is not what he had told me. He originally told me no. He said that he would send a
 message telling them to contact me and describing my concerns. He told me they would call me back
 in the next 24 hours. Since this was the sunday of memorial day weekend, I confirmed that they were
 open on monday, so i would expect the call before tuesday. He told me that they were not closed for
 the holiday and if i did not hear back by tuesday, i could calll again, but that i would hear back by then
 for sure. Nobody called. I called back on tuesday and went through a similar process in an attempt to
 speak with a supervisor. I asked this person to put me in contact with th people in charge of the
 technician that had come out the previous week. He originally told me there was no way to reach
 them. Then he said he would transfer my call to them. After a few seconds, I was disconnected. I
 called back and asked to speak directly to a supervisor. The person did not want to transfer me and
 kept attempting to troubleshoot my internet issues, telling me that I needed a tech to come replace
 my old modem. He told me there was no way to contact the tech that had come out before or their
 department. Finally, he transferred me to his supervisor. This supervisors name was Robert,
 employee Id number: 1112. He was extremely unhelpful. He told me he had no way of contacting the
 people that send the techs out. He told me that the problem was definitely not the modem, but my
 router and that I would need to contact the company for my router to resolve the issue. He would
 repeat back to me my concerns as if he understood, but then his solutions disregarded everything I
 said. He told me that his manager was not in and that there was nobody above him that I could speak
 to. Finally, he set me up with an appointment to have another tech out, threatening that I would need
 to pay money for the appointment if it was not a Comcast issue. I repeatedly told him that I felt an
 appointment was unnecessary and that we could save the person a trip by just contacting the tech
 that had come out before. After that call, I attempted to call again to reach a supervisor that might be
 more helpful. I somehow ended up reaching somebody that did not work with the internet specifically,
 but she was, by far, the most helpful person that I spoke to from Comcast. She actually listened to
 what I said about what the tech had told me. She did notice a discrepancy in my account information.
 She said that the internet modem was on a different outlet than the internet service. She wasn't sure if
 that could cause the problems I was having, but knew that it wasn't supposed to be that way. She
 switched it so that it was correct. I couldn't verify if it fixed the problem until I ended the call and
 restarted my phone. I attempted to leave a message with her supervisor thanking her for her help, but
 was disconnected. My internet was still around 4 bpms, so I tried calling Comcast again so that I
 could just use the automated system to send a refresh signal, since that usually works temporarily.
 When I called, the menu was completely different, and I kept getting weird hold music that I have
 never gotten before. When I chose the option for internet connectivity issues, the system hung up on
 me. I attempted this 8 times before I gave up. I called the same 2 numbers each time, 1800comcast
 and 1888comcast. I got a variety of different menus and was disconnected before I could do anything
 each time. I got a call from another person in Comcast later in the day. I have no idea why he was
 calling. He gave me more information about why I was having so many issues, though. He told me
 that all the call centers are operated by different third parties and you never know which one you will
 reach. None of them actually have the ability to reach Comcast, although sometimes you might reach
 a call center run directly by Comcast. He said that the technicians that come to our houses and
 apartments are run by another group and they have no way of contacting them directly and that they
 don't even have a phone number to call. He did not know why I was having trouble with the
 automated phone system. Today, the tech came out. He replaced my modem. He said that they have
 no good way of putting notes into the system. He also had no way of getting inc contact with the tech
 that had come out the week before. Currently, the new modem is working fine, but I don't know what
 issue the tech noticed the first time, so I don't know if I will have any further issues with this. I do know
 that I have been paying for speeds that I was no getting and if I continue to have issues, I have
 nobody to contact."

930,"Today I called Comcast customer service to find out the procedure to install my own cable modem.
 The first agent said that she could help me but obviously after a few minutes I could tell she did not know what she was talking about, so I requested that she transfer me to someone knowledgeable about this issue, SHE HUNG UP!
 When I called back in, I again asked to speak to someone who could give me info on what I needed to do to install my own modem. At this point, the agent does not offer information about the modem but instead tells me that she can make me an offer to lower my bill which she tells me is due to go up by $30 per month on the next statement. She proceeds to tell me that she can offer me the same internet and cable service I now have plus add telephone service and reduce my bill to $108 per month total including taxes if I agree to a 1 year contract. Since I am presently paying $130 and according to her I will be raised another $30 per month on my next statement, I am a little skeptical about the offer. So I ask her at least 2 or 3 more times to verify the $108 per month rate and also the fact that my current plan will not change. Every time she confirms these terms! So I agree to go ahead. She keeps me on hold for 10-15 while she gets things approved. After around 35 minutes I am disconnected, and she never calls me back.
 Later this evening I am watching TV and notice that my current channel lineup has been changed and I no longer have the ""preferred"" channels that I had earlier today. Once again I have to call and go through the whole BS security process to get to speak to someone. I am then informed that my plan has been switched to a lesser package. THE PREVIOUS CS AGENT FLAT OUT LIED TO ME TO GET ME TO AGREE TO THE NEW 1 YEAR CONTRACT WITH A LESSER PACKAGE!!
 I said that I needed to speak to a supervisor or I was going to cancel my service. The agent said that the supervisor was busy and she would have him call me back, that was and hour and a half ago, NO CALL BACK, ITS NOW 10PM.
 So my service has now been downgraded to a lesser package despite the fact that my service is paid for another 3 weeks. And each time you contact Comcast you have to speak to a different person and explain all over again what has happened.

931,"I had Comcast installed in my home on February 3, but never was able to receive working internet service (it worked for a few hours here and there). They sent technicians, told me to buy a new modem, but nothing worked. I repeatedly contacted them to help me fix the service, and to take the charges off my bill for the services that did not work. They would promise to have someone call me back, and all three times I received no call back. I even sent a certified letter detailing every contact that I had with them, and all of the technical details of how the internet service didn't work. I still received no response. When I finally called and told them to shut off my service, they put down that they had shut it down for non-payment and sent it to a collection agency. I have never received a call back from anyone in billing nor a response to my certified letter. It is clear that Comcast is using this technique to avoid taking responsibility for their inability to provide a working internet service to my home. It is unthinkable that a company should be allowed to bill for a service that they did not provide, especially one this large and powerful.

932,"We have been Comcast subscribers for over 25 years. My husband and I lost our jobs in 2011. Although he got a new job, I am still unemployed and we are still making about $2k less each month.
 We have tried to reduce our bill with Comcast but they make it very difficult. We were paying $177 for their premium package and the first of the year that amount went up to $215. I called to get things reduced and was able to get it down to $155 (plus taxes/fees). Unfortunately, that is just not enough. We have been struggling for years now but the mortgage company refuses to work with us. Now I am having major medical issues and I am looking at thousands of dollars worth of medical bills and possibly chemo treatments. I meet again with the oncologist on the 23rd, so we have got to get that bill down. I asked how much it would go down from the $155 if I dropped the cable and the landline phone. I was shocked to find out they wanted only $40 less making the 100MBps internet a whopping $115 (plus taxes/fees)! I asked how much it would cost to drop the internet in half to 50MBps and I was told $88 (plus taxes/fees). I am dropping my speed in half by not the price. I asked how much I am paying right now for internet and I was told $29!
 I took my concerns to social media only to find out that my friends were paying about $50 a month for 50MBps internet. We have very little left these days. We have no money to go out to eat or movies... TV & internet is our only source of entertainment. I understand this is no concern of yours or Comcast we are just another person struggling to keep their head above water. But Comcast is not being fair with customers across the board. Half the time when you call to speak to someone at Comcast, the person barely speaks English... I don't even know if they full understand my frustration.
 Please do not allow Comcast to continue to do this to everyone. This bundling of services is all about trying to keep the customers from downgrading or canceling all together. All I want to do is downgrade to Internet and just get by with our local channels and maybe some Netflix. Please, they should not be able to charge these ridiculous rates. I would cancel all together, but you can't even look for a job without Internet and my husband is still trying to find a job closer to home... especially with all my medical problems.

933,"After a long battle with Comcast to solve my Internet service (which was magically solved with seemingly little help on their part), I was credited for missed appointments. Also promised by a Corporate member was that my pricing would not be raised after the initial first-year package ended. It has since been raised, and is obscenely priced.
 They are charging me $18 for On Demand service (!), $10 for an HD Technology fee, and an additional package priced at nearly $90 just to bundle services together. My bill was an incredible $154.
 I feel this pricing is both unfair, and to add effect, I was promised it would not be raised after the last many issues I had with them."
934,"The company I work for recently switched our email service from a competitor to Comcast. We are a sales oriented company that relies heavily on the ability to communicate with vendors and customers in real time to solve problems and provide solutions. It has been a week since the ""official"" switchover to Comcast, and half of our company still does not have email accounts established and Comcast technical support has been unable to help, call back, offer a solution, or do anything other than promise an ""escalation"" which results in NO call back or help. What else should we do? I have a weeks worth of call logs and notes from various Comcast reps that have no clue of what they are doing. We are losing money everyday that we can not establish email accounts (a feature that the competitor never had a problem with). Any and all help is appreciated.

935,"I bought my own modem back in late November, 2014. I called Comcast that day and had them activate my own modem that I own(it's now been active on Comcast's network since December, 2014). I was told to drop off my old modem(that I was renting from comcast) to their service center, which I did promptly within days. I have called in at least 4 times trying to get them to quit charging me for the modem I no longer have! It's $10 a month. They never call me back, never give me an update. 4 months ago they made me fax in a copy of my invoice from when I bought my modem in November. Still not resolved. The most recent ticket # is 029693350. I have had it with Comcast! I have spent at least 8 hours of my time on this! I am on the phone with them now as I write this and of course nothing has been done with my ticket from 8 days ago.

936,"I decided to get Comcast's service because of the $19.99 per month for a 12-month period in June 2014. I have received exactly 3 months of bills. Those 3 months were 9/14, 10/14, 11/14. Besides those months, the bills has ranged from $39.50 to $98.50. I should have given Comcast a total of $342.60 for internet service over the course of the advertised deal. Instead, that figure is almost $300 dollars more.

937,"Comcast has sent my name and number to a collections agency claiming I never returned equipment. I physically returned the equipment in person to a Comcast store on June 12 and have a dated receipt for equipment. Since then, I have started receiving automated calls from Comcast to return equipment.
 After every call, I have called Comcast for information on my account. I opened an ER ticket (what Comcast calls an inventory search and request) at a Comcast store and a second ER ticket over the phone. This was to confirm that I have no outstanding equipment at my house. I have multiple calls recorded where the Comcast representative says I don't have any extra equipment and they will make notes to stop the calls. I spoke with an employee at a Comcast store who said, and showed me the screen, that I have no extra equipment.
 I spoke with someone from the collections agency (Universal Systems) who says they only received notification of the unreturned equipment on June 17. This is five days after I returned it with receipt. It is the same day I opened the first ER ticket (what Comcast calls an inventory search request) about equipment Comcast claims was missing.
 I have included two Account numbers since I briefly had to open a second account due to moving complications. One of them is currently closed.
 The URL where I am hosting audio of the phone calls or copies of the return receipts can be provided if requested.

938,"In April 2015 I called Comcast and advised I would be moving. The representative I spoke with advised me there would be no issues. I provided my new address, she stated all I needed to do was call when it got closer to my move date in May. She advised there would be no fees as it was a simple transfer.
 First week of May I phoned Comcast. Asked for a stop service on May 9th at my old home and start transfer order at the new home on the 10th. All I would need to do is hook my equipment up and the service would work, the signal would be sent and set up and working the morning of the 10th.
 We moved on the 10th and on the 11th I attempted to set up and there was no signal. After hours on the phone w Comcast they finally said they would need to send out a technician because the transfer is not working. I was advised the technician visit would of no charge.
 I am a remote employee for IBM / Seterus and due to the nature of the situation was unable to perform my job due to lack of service. Had I been advised a technician would need to come out in April I would have ensured that appointment be scheduled on May 10th. The first available appointment wasn't until May 14th. I spoke w a Lady named Jan whom claimed her badge is number was 1242. She stated that the fee should be waived and I could speak w the billing department after the technician visit to ensure it would be deducted. On May 15th I called Comcast back to verify the fee was not added. I initially spoke w a Dorian, who states he could credit me $25.00 for a $39.95 fee. That was not acceptable not what I was told.
 He transferred me to his supervisor Camille. After explaining the situation to Camille, explained the number of agents I spoke w to trouble shoot the issue, advised her I was told I would not be charged a technician fee, then lost time for work and minutes spent in my cell phone plan. She stated she would deduct 47.68 from my bill, this amount was the $39.95 fee as well as a decision for the days I did not have service.
 I received my bill and there is a line item for the $39.95 fee as well as another ""technician service fee of $0.00). This leads me to believe she failed to enter in the deduction. Today I call Comcast back to explain the situation and they refuse to waive the fee. I was only honored a $10 deduction at this time. I'm still in need of a seduction of $29.95 for the fee and at this rate compensation for the hours I've spent wasting my cell phone minutes, loss of hours my job and the complete and utter disgust of unethical business that occurs with Comcast and its employees. The day I was trying to set up the Internet in the phone w Comcast I must have unplugged devices at least ten times before they stated there is an issue and a technician would need to come out. Comcast is a giant corrupt corporation and unfortunately we the people do not have many options to choose from. The FCC needs to put a stop to the way this company gets away w all of the wrong they do. I've had nothing but issues as a
 Comcast customer over the decades, this time I'm writing the FCC because spending needs to be done.
 10.00 still needs to be credited 29.95

940,I continue to receive unwanted calls from Comcast despite my instructions to not call me.
941,"I have had on ongoing issue with Comcast for 2 weeks. I have had 4 appointments without installation being completed. The first appointment the rep came before his scheduled time and then when he realized a lot of work had to be done he asked to come back the following day because he had to make his next appointment. The next day the tech called at 10 min to 9 and said he would be there in 10 minutes but didn't show up until 11:45 and then I couldn't wait for the process to be completed. My next appointment I wasn't home when the tech showed up. The last appointment Comcast cancelled without informing me because they said it was an issue with the previous tenants in the apartment I lived in. I was then told I need to provide a copy of my lease and id to a service department. Which I did and when I tried contacting Comcast to see if they received the copies they said no and that the sales associate at the service center did not fax them anything and that she could have removed the block off the account. I was then told that I needed to speak to a Margaret in regards to my number and last name popping up about a previous bill. The bill was not for me, but because Margaret had put a note on the account no one would help me set up my services. I kept getting transferred around and told that a supervisor would contact me and no one ever returned a call. I was told that comcast would give me an er ticket and I would get first priority on getting my services installed because of the ongoing issues that I was having. I was promised an appointment for Sunday June 7 between 11 am and 1pm however no one ever showed up. Today someone came to my house for a scheduled appointment between 11 am and 1 pm for an appointment that I told the sales associate wasn't good for me when she gave me the appointment. She told me she had to put that in the system in order to open up an ER ticket. It's unfortunate that cable companies are allowed to have monopolies in certain areas. This allows them to treat their customers like garbage and know that its not much the customer can do. I would appreciate if this matter was looked into so that the situation could be rectified. By the way, I am still expecting a call from a supervisor after speaking with the dispatch this morning in regards to the appointment that they schedule for today.

942,"On 5/27/15, I ordered Xfinity home security. they sent two technicians out on 6/6/15 and on 6/13/15 neither of which installed any equipment. I have spoken to well over 10 reps at Comcast, and I still have no equipment installed to date. I spoke with two people from the customer retention center who offered me credits in order to keep my business and also as a courtesy to my time. Although credits were verbally given to me in on record, comcast has billed me over $400 for services that I do not have an equipment that does not exist. Majority of that money were the installation fees that comcast said they would waive because of the ordeal I had already been through. prior to Comcast adding these charges on to my account there was a credit of $153.17, which was eaten up by all the charges Comcast inadvertently placed on my account. I still have not had any equipment installed and I still do not see the credits on my account.

944,"We have been without service for over a week now. Several hours spent on phone with techs have been unsuccessful, and they insist there is a problem with my modem, when both tv and internet are out. A reasonable person would consider that even if I removed or unplugged the modem, the tv service would still continue to work, as it has been working before. They have now increased my bill again because of the technician service charge, but also, continually add services to my account without my permission. For instance, I informed them that our family does not watch HD, but they continue to charge us for it. We do not rent their modem. We've always had our own modem. They have $10.00 charge per month for this. They are also re-charging a one-time installation charge of $39.95, which they should not be, since no new equipment is being installed, and a on site service visit of $39.95 for a problem that is outside of the house. It is very unfair the way they treat their customers. I have had an email account with Comcast for a very long time, since 2003, and rely on my Comcast email address to communicate. The service area of Islamorada that we live in is known for having terrible issues with Comcast, since their service techs don't like to come out here. In fact, when we moved here 1 and 1/2 years ago, it took us two months of false promises and cancellations to get Comcast service. Requests to speak to supervisors have never been returned. We are requesting your assistance/intervention, and thank you in advance.

945,"Since October of last year (2014) I've had virtually no internet service at my house, despite continuing to pay my bill, and despite Comcast sending numerous techs to my house to address the issue.
 I signed up in October and, while I had connectivity problems from the start, I could generally count on Internet access being available at any given time.
 Over time, the intermittent connectivity problems began to manifest more frequently. It was at this point that I decided to reach out to Comcast support.
 The following 6 or 7 months leading up to the present consist of the most (almost comically) inept corporation on the planet dragging me through the mud, not resolving my issue, continuing to bill me, and offering absolutely no recourse.
 Along with the countless chat sessions with Comcast Support, numerous technicians have been sent to my home, all of whom have identified a problem that Comcast is responsible for fixing. Invariably, they hung around for 1-2 hours, testing this and that, and managed to get connectivity restored only to have it go back out at some point over the next 48 hours or so. The last two guys (they showed up as a pair) even pulled the ""it must be your modem"" card after spending 2 hours coming in and out of my house, testing lines or whatever (even though none of the other technicians saw fit to suggest my modem was the issue). Exhausted, and with a schedule to stick to, I let them configure a new Comcast modem so that in the future I could at least illustrate that the underlying issue has nothing to do with the modem. Sure enough, with the new modem installed and configured, the internet is up --- until they back out of the driveway, which is about when it goes out.
 I then call Comcast support and am told that I need to call the Activation Team, even though the technicians that were just at my house setup and configured the modem on the spot. Out of morbid curiosity, I decided to call the Activation Team where I spoke with an individual who came to the conclusion that my original modem (the one the two guys just at my house insisted was the root of my problem) had never been properly provisioned on my account. After 30 minutes or so, over the phone mind you, this guy manages to get me connected somehow and was actually a pleasure to work with. Unfortunately, however, within 24 hours I'm back where I started.
 Honestly, what I've typed out doesn't even begin to touch on frustration I've experienced, or the absurd business practices I've witnessed by what is ultimately an utterly incompetent corporate entity. I've been hung up on, had representatives straight up leave a chat session and close the ticket, and been offered ridiculous promotions related to a service that doesn't even work in the first place!
 I'm completely out of options, outside of canceling the service; but even that is a total pain. Not to mention I've paid Comcast approximately $300-400 for a service that for the majority of the time I've had it has not worked reliably.

 Comcast is trying to make people keep cable by not allowing unlimited data usage. I gave up cable and want to use Nextflix and Amazon Prime for my entertainment. We onlly watch a few movies a month and some cartoons. However, I get notices each month that the data is near capacity. It is not fair that we pay for internet and have to be limited to its usages. Before when I had cable with comcast, I never got a call about internet usage. My children were online almost all the time. Now they are barely online. We need a way to have unlimited internet usage. Comcast is trying to keep folks on cable and not being able to watch TV online. Also, you can't get a straight bill. The bill is different each month. Every time you talk to someone you thing it is straighten out then the next month roll around and you have a different bill again.

I get regular error messages, my cable goes out completely, the remote functionality fails when watching movies, the picture is pixelated too often, I access movies and tent will not play, displaying error messages, for channels I am paying for. I filed a separate complaint due to the lack of promised internet bandwidth speed, but this is something that as a consumer, locality tax-payer, disabled veteran, and an active account holder with Comcast, is not acceptable. I also can't fathom why my rate goes up without any explanation. I received a letter indicating they are going to charge me for a receiver they were unaware of....they installed everything in our house, and, nothing is new or purchased after market. They have done this three times since we switched to xfinity last year.

949,"I have had multiple issues with Comcast Internet not getting correct speeds. In the last 30 days my internet has worked intermittently for maybe 5 days of the 30. On or around the beginning of May my internet would not work at all. I called and a tech came out and switched out my modem. It worked for Aprox 25 days and right around the 27th or 28th I had to call again as it worked that morning, but went completely out that afternoon. Phone tech had everything reset and tried many options. We were on the phone close to an hour with him advising to call my tv manufacturer as they may have had an update. My tv manufacturer advised that the prob is with the wifi speed not being up to par to work on my tv. When I tried to connect it would not register the wifi at all. The rep advised that Comcast turns down speeds at the end of the month and I could be affected. I called Comcast back and spoke with Rose who asked me do the same steps I have already done 3 times. Of course nothing worked. She even advised based on records that I have not used any of my internet usage for the month. She set up a ticket for a tech to come out. Tech came out 6 days later and changed the modem. It worked briefly and began to buffer while watching Netflix. It has STILL not worked since. I disconnected my cable because of the poor service and lie I was told about my rates. I just stream Netflix now and need internet for this. Bigger issue is that I work from home and need to be able to access the Internet for this purpose. I am not technical and cannot explain why this is happening. I just know it worked and I came home later that afternoon and it would not connect. I am still out of service as I type this complaint. I am at my wits end and just want it to work. Ever since the xfinity allowed for others to get free wifi, it has not worked correctly in many months. I'm tired of no one knowing what the issues are and blaming it on everything else. I NEED IT TO WORK AS I AM LOSING MONEY ON MY MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS FEES AND INTERNET FEES. I AM UNABLE TO WORK FROM HOME BECAUSE OF THIS. I just called again twice at 5:45 pm 6/5 and got hung up on twice. FIX IT!

 Request #334540 ""RE: Comcast Executive Customer R..."" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #334540:
 Good morning Chris. I just tried to call you twice and it ring, goes to dead air, then rings busy. Very strange. Nonetheless, it is imperative that this internet issue get resolved. I have been having issues with my internet for months now. It began with slower internet speeds, now it will not work at all in the manor that it used too I have been unable to work from home since the first service call in regards to this issue. If you look at the history you will see that I have had many calls about this issue. I was told by one of the techs that the issue was on my end as to why I cannot VPN in. My IT team stated it is my internet. I got tired of the back and forth and just decided to work in the office. At this time I am unable to do so. I have to work remotely due to personal issues I am dealing with. I have already lost several days of pay due to not being able to get connected. As of today, I have to stay at a friend’s house to work. She has Comcast and I have no issues logging on and working with my VPN. I am using her Comcast internet now and am VPN’d into my employers server to send you this. At my house, I cannot even get logged in.
 To add to my frustration, I have made in the past few weeks several reports to be told several different things. I have been told the issue was my television. I called Vizio (television support) and they advised me to do a speed test, which Comcast did not. He said the speed was nothing near what I was supposed to get and it was clearly a Comcast issue. I called again that evening and spoke with a Comcast tech named Rose. She was very nice and could tell I was beyond frustrated. She told me she had to go thru the same steps that the tech before did so she could log the speeds. She then was of course not able to fix it and said she could see I was not using any of my data. She set up for a tech to come out which was 5 days later. I called again and spoke with a Hammed in GA. He said there was an issue in my area on node 506 and that they were working on it. No timeframe as to when it would be fixed. He was very rude and during the speed test check we got disconnected and he never called me back. I spent close to 3 hours on the phone in one night trying to get this resolved.
 A tech finally came out on 6/2. He changed out the modem, again, and it worked for approx. 5 min after he left. Ehen I say worked, I was so excited that I could log into Netflix, that I did not think to watch it for a while. Sure enough not even 5 min into the movie it began to freeze and has not worked since.
 I talked to another tech this time and asked for a manager. He stated that the modem I have is an older modem and would not allow me to get onto my work VPN, or stream multiple devices, and that he would send me a newer one at no charge in 3-5 days. WHY WAS I NOT GIVEN A NEW ONE WHEN TECH CAME OUT.
 I feel like no one really knows what the issue is at Comcast and all are quick to blame it on my television or employer’s server. I am beyond upset and if I had better options, I would leave Comcast in a second! I was also told by the Vizio that Comcast turns down the signal at the end of the month and turns it back up after the first and that this has been a big compliant. I just know ever since Comcast allowed anyone to log in and pay for services, mine has not worked fully since.
 I have lost money, time, and patience with Comcast. I pay you on time every month and should be treated as I matter to Comcast
 I want this internet to work exactly as it has in the past before the changes, and I want credit for the hell and frustration I have gone thru in getting this repaired.
 I look forward to your prompt response. Thank you.

 Good morning , I wanted to report back to you as I have been monitoring services in efforts to make sure all is truly resolved. I have been home for the last several days working from home, and the issue I am having is that I get kicked off line every 5 to 10 minutes. This causes tons of issues because I am doing a lot of data entry. Each time I get kicked out, I have to start over again. This has me annoyed beyond belief. I started monitoring my speeds yesterday. Last night at 11pm, I could not log onto Netflix in my room. My speed showed at 27mpbs. As recent as 10 minutes ago it logged at
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 30mpbs, and that is with me online working on my laptop and nothing else. Once my daughter gets up and starts streaming Netflix, I am sure it will be a lot less. I am paying for 50mbps.
 I also have an alarm system with several cameras. My cameras when pulled up on my phone buffer, and only show in black and white. I stayed with a friend in little rock this past Wednesday, who has the same internet speed as I do, and when looking at my cameras from her house, I do not have any delays, and they show in COLOR!
 I want this fixed I want the level of services I am paying for 24/7. This is still an open issue and I would like it resolved asap. I would also like to know when a tech is coming out in advance so that I can be here.
 Also, as stated in my last email, I think the tech in error may have disconnected the outlet in my room while correcting another as I can no longer get services in there when I move my box.
 And last, I would like some clarity on a phone call conversation with a call center supervisor on 6/10/15. He advised that my modem I had was old, and it limits the amount of devices I can use. He advised he was mailing to me, at no charge, a deluxe model modem which I am yet to receive. When the tech came out on 6/14, he advised that he was unaware of a newer model modem as advised. I don’t understand why this supervisor would tell me this if it is not true?? Do you even show this deluxe box has been shipped as I do not have????
 Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

 Good afternoon . I was expecting to hear back from you in regards to my below email sent 6/26/15. I am still experiencing issues with my internet speeds. I am unable to work from home due to this, and have to work 30 miles away at a friends’ home.
 I just tested her speed and it is 12.54mbps. This is much slower than what I am getting, which mine averages less than 30mpbs, and I am paying for 50mpbs! Her connection is stable and much faster even at the lower speed. It makes no sense to me at all. I do not experience the lag and buffering, as well as getting kicked off of my work server ever few minutes like I do at my house. I just don’t understand this (b) (6)

 Too add insult to injury, I just received my bill. You all charged me for a service call? I was also billed to have a cable box shipped when I didn’t even ask for another box!! I had to go out and switch the one given, because it would not work. Check my records! I was told by a supervisor which I mention below that I needed an up to date modem, and I have yet to receive.
 This is frustrating to deal with and I hoped to hear back from you by now. Please let me know that you have received both emails and that you have some answers/fixes in place for me. Again, all I want is exactly what I am paying for, the outlet fixed that was disconnected in my room when the tech came out last week to repair the other one, credit for these fees I have been billed, and we will discuss credits once this issues is FULLY corrected.
 I await your contact.
 Thank you.

 Your carrier has provided the FCC with a response to your complaint. You should receive a copy of the response from the carrier within 7-10 days via postal mail. As such, no further action is required. Your complaint is closed.
 Thank you for your complaint and help in furthering the FCC’s mission on behalf of consumers."
950,"I received a bill from ""Comcast"" for $287! I have been told via recent emails from Comcast employees that my bill should be $119 plus taxes, surcharges, and fees. Total: $144. This latest bill includes a $68 charge from a balance from my old account (I moved in Feb). I have no issue with that but $144 plus $68 IS NOT $287. I can see on the bill where I was double charged for 2 different things and charged for things that are supposed to be included in my monthly cost. I have called Corporate Office of Comcast 15 times with no resolution and sent a dozen or more emails. My prior bill (2/13/15) was $266 BUT said it was for Feb. 3 to April 2 2015 (2 months) AND said I had NO previous balance?

 Dear FCC (Your Ticket No. 217474 was served on Comcast Cable Communications on Apr 7 for its review and response).,
 I just sent this email to Comcast's Executive office (Diane C. and Roger Angley):
 Diane,
 Thank you for calling. I have called your number several times...as well as Roger Angley's. I have left messages. I do realize that you receive other calls besides mine and are likely busy. May I suggest that this issue be resolved via email. It is a much more effective tool for resolving things like this as opposed to missed calls and voice mails. I am simply asking that someone look at my bill (acct# ), identify the over-charges or double charges, make the necessary adjustments, and email me the final bill. (b) (6)
 My previous bill ($266-billing date 02/13) states it is for services from 02/03 - 04/02. It would make sense that a 2 month bill minus savings and adjustments would be for that amount since my monthly total charges are supposed to be approximately $144. But to get my latest bill of $287 for a single month does not. I have emails from Comcast employees stating my monthly charges are supposed to be $144. If I had ordered several movies or added several movie channels or ordered pay-per-view programs I would not be disputing this bill. However, I did none of those things.
 I do NOT want to change services. I am normally very happy with my Comcast (internet speeds and reliability, cable connection and quality of pictures and channels, .and phone service). However, I will not and can not pay any more than my agreed upon $144 (approximate) per month with the exception of movies or pay-per-view items I may order in the future. Some of the discrepancies I noticed are charges for additional amounts for a HD package which is supposed to part of my monthly $144. Like most people, I live on a budget. I am already stretching it to include $144 for cable and internet.
 I have made over 20 calls and sent an equal number of emails to Comcast employees over this simple and easily resolvable dispute. I will Not be doing either again. However, I will send a sincere ""Thank You"" to the person who simply looks at my bill, identifies the discrepancies, corrects them, and sends me the actual and honest results. I have already been pushed to the point of contacting Consumer Affairs, The BBB, and The FCC over this. I prefer this not end with me being forced to do more or hire an attorney. This has already gone way beyond reasonable over a relatively small dollar amount of a dispute. This situation shows that I'll need to go to these extremes any time I need to get the smallest of things resolved. Please show me that my impression is wrong and that Comcast has not become the ruthless, uncaring, dishonest monopoly people say it is.

952,"IMPROPER BILLING-I relocated across town to a new address in Jacksonville, FL on Dec 17, 2014. I cancelled Comcast service proactively at this address on December 15th, 2014 via 2 phone calls (to verify close out date). They instructed me no confirmation # or ticket # was needed and the accout would be closed due to relocation with no problems since there is no contract. I began Comcast service at my new address across town the same month. In january 2015 I received an incorrect ongoing service bill for internet services at my old address in addition to my new address. After this 1st incorrect bill i called Comcast, they promptly admitted the error, said it was a mistake and would be taken care of. I continued receiving an internet service bill each subsequent month and each time i called to inform them i no longer reside at this old addres and acct had been cancelled, and was instructed this was a mistake and to disregard the bill the account info would be updated. On April 7th, 2015 I received a collections notice (from a Collections company out of Carrolton, TX) for $344.67 for both unreturned equipment and unpaid internet service bills for my old address which includes service until what appears to be Feb 24, 2015 even though my last errant bill shows billing service until 3/22/2015 at old address. I have the 2 written receipts and tracking numbers for the returned equipment as well as the supervisors verification (name and #) that i returned equipment. Went into local Comcast personally twice including today April 8, 2015,and was told they couldnt help me since they were a sales only center and there were no billing centers in the area that could correct this mistake. Billing rep on the phone hung up on me after saying there was nothing she could do. Ive called multiple times with no success and gone in person twice without success in correcting bill. I have utility bills and proof i havent lived at old address since Dec 17th, 2014. Collections actions begins for improper billing and I can prove Comcast has no verification to bill for service after cancelling and equipment that was returned. My previous address was vacant for atleast several weeks after i left and there was no service in my name at that address since cancelling in Dec 2014. I asked Comcast billing if all calls are recorded since they can track the day and time i called and verify cancellation (they say calls are monitored and recorded for quality assurance) but they refuse to verify. Please help, thanks- Jacksonville, Florida.

953,"A Comcast residential sales person cold called my home several times during the week of March 16 & 23. I phoned him on March 30 & explained my issues with Comcast Business. He offered to 'switch' me back to residential internet, with increased speed, and other services as a 2-year promotion and substantially less cost. When I called Comcast business to cancel, I was told that I would be required to pay a $1,100 cancellation fee; was told the Sales Rep should have done his research before selling me a new internet package. Calls to both Comcast Residential & Comcast Business are not resolving the issue. As the consumer, who has paid both accounts as agreed (no lates), I just want reliable service.....Comcast Business has not been forthright in their ads about the service offering - it is NOT true business class service (when my cable goes out, so does the business internet)

956,"At the beginning of March there was offer from comcast Internet for 29.99$/month, online subscription only. I wanted to get that offer as I was paying 64.99$/month for Internet and TV. I never watch TV and hence contacted comcast via phone almost 10 times, without any help as the call dropped every time after ""please wait while I connect you to right representative"". After that I chatted with agent online 5 times, they told me that I need to take off my TV in order to get 29.99$ Internet package, for that they provided me another number. Which kept doing the same thing and I was not able to disconnect my TV service. After trying to get my TV disconnected for about a week, via phone and online chat I went in the service centre after a week. The Representative over there said same thing to call the number, which I called while being right at the service centre and same thing happened, I coulndt get hold of any person. I asked the Rep at service centre to cancel my TV and he cancelled my TV and Internet both, when I got home I didn't have any Internet either when I specifically asked to cancel TV only. I had to go on Monday and asked the rep to activate Internet ONLY and he activated the TV+Internet again (39.99). He told me to get 29.99 deal contact the reps online. When I got back home and talked to reps they said that I cannot have the deal of 29.99 Internet only as you have TV+Internet service. I had already returned TV equipment. So back to square one with 39.99 TV+Internet deal instead of 29.99 Internet ONLY deal."
957,"I have had the worst customer service from Comcast that I have ever experienced from anywhere else. I am very frustrated with the people who represent the Comcast's company. My issue started a little over a month ago in early March. I noticed I charged almost double what I normally pay for internet. I called to find out why my bill had increased. Every person I spoke to on the phone was rude and not helpful at all. I was told my promotion had ran out, which was understandable. But then one of the representatives felt it was necessary to explain to me what a promotion was using a sale at the grocery as an example. I couldn't believe she had just said what she did to me. At this point I was ready to cancel my service. Cancelling my service with Comcast was not easy. I almost decided not to cancel and to stay with them until they said it was too late that the cancelation order had been processed. So I moved on to AT&T. Then today, April 4th, almost a full month after dealing with Comcast, I see that they took $78.05 out of my account. Of course I called to find out why. The first lady explained to me that my service was not due to shut off until April 9th. This was never explained to me before, otherwise I would have not had AT&T start my service until April 9th. I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor. She then placed me on hold and was shortly hung up on. At this point my anxiety had increased even more. I chose to call back and try again. The second lady I spoke to on the phone tonight told me that I had to wait on hold for 40 minutes before I could talk to one of the two supervisors working at the time. She said she would check back with me every four minutes. She checked back with 3 minutes later, it was about 8:10 pm, and then again I was unhung on. I called back after I was able to put my kids to bed. When I was connected to the billing the message played stating the office was closed. This was at 9:02 pm. So this leads me to believe that the lady on the phone was going make me stay on hold for 40 minutes until the office closed at 9pm. I am overly frustrated with dealing with Comcast. I feel like they scammed $78 out of me. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that there is not an email address for Comcast to complain or to handle an issue outside of calling. The representatives are not easy to talk to, they are rude, disrespectful and unwilling to help. I honestly feel like they get entertainment out of treating customers the way that do.

I didn't get a chance to return their item (which I didn't use for my personal use either) and I slowly forgot about it. But, when I looked back at my billing for the last year, I found out that they are charging me an extra 10 dollars every month for that modem which they sent me mistakenly.

 I received a mail from FCC that I will receive a response from COMCAST to this ticket in 7-10 business days. I got this message from FCC on april,29. I am still waiting as of today to see any postal mail from COMCAST"
959,"I have Comcast high speed internet for 25 Mbps. Since last 1 month or more i have noticed that my speed goes very slow after 7:00 pm evening and it was giving hard to work as i have to login to my work at evening.
 I called Comcast customer service and they did standard trouble shooting but nothing helps. They schedule technician appointment and first technician come at noon and yes speed was fine as expected so he said it could be network issue.
 on same day evening same issue i m getting hardly 3 or 4 Mbps speed.
 I called Comcast again, same trouble shooting but no result. They schedule second technician appointment, he came speed was fine but he changed cord out side in main feed and told that he hoped that this will fix issue.
 But it was same thing no difference. I called Comcast again as i was very frustrated and talked with Superwiser and he schedule third appointment for technician between 5:00 and 7:00 pm. Technician came at around 5:00 pm and he checked history of network, inside and outside cord, changed splitter etc...it was almost 7:00 pm that time and speed started to decrease and i showed it to him. He said nothing more he can do as nothing wrong inside house line or anything. Actually after last technician visit, something went wrong with my WiFi connection also, as before i used to have good WiFi but not my WiFi connection continuously searching and trying to connect and not getting weaker signal strength.
 I am having still same problem. Speed get very slow down and i m hardly getting 3-4 Mbps. I don't understand why Comcast not finding the root cause of problem and fix it as i have complained so many times. There must be something wrong somewhere.
 I hope as i m complaining via FCC, Comcast will take some serious action to fix this issue.

960,"I moved at the end of 2014 and requested that Comcast transfer my xfinity package (phone, internet and cable) to my new address. After the move, I lost the phone number I have had for close to 15 years, and was given a new email address. When I questioned this, I was told it was because I had to link the account number used for my old address to the account number for my new address.
 It turns out, my service was not transferred, but instead new service was setup, and my service at the old address was never turned off. So, when I was paying my bill for the months of January and February, I was unknowingly paying it to the old address. I only realized what happened when Comcast shut off my service for non-payment...when I called in to Comcast, it started a long nightmare of being transferred to different departments, calls being dropped after being on hold for close to an hour, and speaking with agents who lacked any essential customer service skills and/or Comcast training. I spoke to a manager who assured me this had been resolved and I would see the credit in 5-7 days. Of course, the credit didn't show up, and when I called back in, I was assured it was because a full billing cycle hadn't passed. It is now over 4 months since I have moved, and 2 billing cycles since the credit was supposed to be applied. And I still haven't gotten anything except a monthly bill that, if I don't pay, will cause my service to be turned off again.
 I have been a Comcast customer for almost 15 years, and while I have had issues in the past, I have never experienced anything so frustrating. In the meantime, I have had issues with the cable boxes for one of my tvs, and would have cancelled if it weren't for this credit issue.
 What is most upsetting is that I have had no one take this issue and see it through to a resolution, which is what good customer service is all about (which includes the managers I have spoken to.) I am at a loss for what to do now...if this isn't resolved ASAP, I will have no other option than to speak with an attorney.

 Dear
 Thanks for your message below advising that you have forwarded my claim to
 your special team. Yes, I heard from the ""team"" within 24 hours about an
 hour ago. What follows is what your ""special team"" member, Eve M., called to
 tell me:
 Dear . Our home office in Philadelphia has sent us your claim
 information in error. We are ""residential"" and your claim is ""business"".
 Consequently, we cannot do anything for you since the home office sent this to
 us in error. Therefore, you will be contacted by a Comcast Business Service
 representative in 24 hours.
 I am writing to you to let you know the above results from your ""special
 team"" referral.
 Since my claim began with calling Comcast Business Service on April 7,
 2015, (because I could not get through after holding on April 6, 2015) and
 again on April 15, 2015 and again on April 24, 2015 and again on May 7, 2015
 to please share this message with him that the claim has now
 arrived back at Business Service where the process began now over thirty
 (30) days ago with NO COMCAST RESPONSE other than your email and two (2) prior
 calls to advise me that I would be contacted in 24 hours.
 Please be advised that I will now be contacting the Florida Public Service
 Commission and the FCC to lodge a formal complaint of Comcast's
 unresponsiveness to my claim for damages. You will then be contacted directly by
 both of these agencies regarding what is now officially according to Eve M.
 Comcast New Case # 1895085 after previously being indentified originally by
 Comcast Business Service representative Chris as ER ticket # 028353444
 and subsequently being told by Comcast Business representative Gloria
 Jackson that the ticket # was revised to ER ticket # 028494341. When I contact
 these Agencies I will include that no one from Comcast ever called me at the
 outset to request my permission for access to my building to install the
 Comcast service for my new tenant at the property.

 Original Message Follows: ------------------------
 Mr. Karinshak,
 I am writing to you because I've called Comcast Business Services, two
 different 800 numbers, for help, followed the instructions given to me by
 Comcast people whose names I have, for the purpose of filing a damage claim.
 I am the owner of the building at 80 Blanding Blvd, Orange Park, Fl. My
 tenant is Mattress One. I received a call on March 27th that the store was
 flooding from rain.
 I immediately sent out a contractor who found that there was a Comcast
 cable left on the roof which floated into the gutters, clogging them and
 causing the rain to enter the building.
 As a result of Comcast's negligence, I am faced with a $650 bill for
 cleaning the gutters and replacing the ceiling tiles in the store. Comcast is
 responsible for the damages so I would appreciate you looking into this as
 soon as possible.
 I followed the instructions of Comcast Business personnel to fax the ER
 ticket
 number 028494341 along with the contractor's invoice and an explanatory
 cover letter requesting reimbursment to Comcast Claims Department at (954)
 236-6179. This was done on 4/24/15 and I have the confirmation in hand.
 (b) (6)
 Comcast installed two orange Xfinity boxes on south and north exterior
 wall of the building with orange cords extending up to the roof. One serves
 Mattress One, your customer, at 80-1 Blanding Boulevard. The other box is at
 80-2 Blanding Boulevard, the adjacent rental unit, currently vacant.
 No one has called, faxed or emailed me in response to the above
 instructions that have been followed.
 Attached are the forms I originally faxed as stated above.
 Thank you for your attention,
 Jacksonville, florida 32217

966,"I am currently a subscriber with Comcast and the X1 platform. This issue is that my internet has not
 worked correctly since Sept when it was installed. Because I also have VOIP and the X1 platform
 NONE of my services have worked and each time I call I have gotten the run around no one wants to
 do right by me and issue credit for the months of services in which my service has not worked
 correctly. I have been hung up on and told no one is going to entertain my credit. I would go to a
 different carrier if possible but that is not something that I can do. In the month of September I called
 each day about service not working, in October there were calls made to comcast once a week for
 the same issue of service not working in the month of November there were calls made every other
 week and then once or twice a month from January until this month. I have had a least 7 techs out to
 my home to correct the issue and appointments that were missed because the teach were calling the
 home phone that was not working.. (I provided comcast with a cell phone to call because the home
 phone was not working) At the point I have paid my bill each month while the reps have explained to
 me that once the service was up and running at 100% they would give me credit for all months in
 which I have had issues. Now that a tech has came out to my home and found the issue was on the
 outside of the apartment, no one wants to make good on their word and issue the credit for the 7
 month of HELL that I have endured attempting to get someone to fix the service. After a 2 hour phone
 call today I was told that I should have kept calling daily...I have a job that I have to go to each day,
 while being a working parent and attending school. I do not have the time to call any company each
 day and endure the 20 min hold time and speak to reps that don't always clearly understand the issue
 because they speak little english. In the end I am asking for the credits that are due. I have not had
 any service working on a constant basis in 8 months and that is not acceptable to anyone. I have
 complained on comcast facebook page and sent messages as well as called and it just does not
 seems like anyone cares about customer service or the fact that I pay about 260.00 each month for
 service that does not work. That is over 3000 per year, and in the end i get horrible treatment and
 horrible customer service along with being hung up on transferred from person to person and no one
 take responsibly for correcting the issue and giving me the correct credit that is due. The credit for
 months of service that should be due to me is Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, March, April and May 1-
 9th.... As of May 9th a tech came out to my home and found that the issue was on the outside of the
 home and corrected the issue. This was after my home has been rewired and new boxes given, this
 should have been the first thing done back in Sept and we would be here now."
967,"Setting up son in an apt in Atlanta GA--already have service in FL--called to schedule internet service
 at a second site (the atlanta ga). Comcast sent equipment and told me that the line was hot. When
 we hooked up equipment, it did not work. After 5 calls to comcast on 5/15 we were told that the line
 was not hot and a technician would be out that day and we would receive a call back. No technician
 ever showed and never got a call back. Spent over 4 hours on the phone with Comcast on 5/16--
 multiple hang ups. Finally got to someone who said a technician will be out before 8pm and we would
 get a call. No technician ever showed and never received any follow up call. 5/17 Spent over 7 hours
 on the phone, opened multiple tickets, Told technician would show 5/17 and was told I would get two
 call backs. No technician ever showed, never got a call back. I am not kidding when I say I have
 probably made 20+ calls to Comcast--the pattern is they promise you service, promise they will call
 you and they NEV ER show up nor do they EVER call you back. We have no service in the atlanta
 GA location and the service has been disgraceful"
968,"Comcast billed me for service I hadn't recvd. My billing statement reflected past due balance that the manager couldn't explain. I called about channels being out. That's why
 when I found out about the billing. The manager (Shirley)was very disrespectful and unwilling to assist with my request. I was hung up on and left on hold for over an hour. Service order not completed after my request. No call back upon request and fees added to my bill. Never recvd a billing statement.

They came a day to soon when I was not home and said they would be back the next day. They did not and said it had been cancelled. Multiple promises not followed through.

971,"After 2 years of being with Comcast having no issues I moved to another house close by and since they've just been tacking on more and more on my bill without my knowledge. They refuse to send me a bill and anything on the online statements doesn't answer why the bill is so high when I've paid the amount I'm supposed to be billed every month. Last month, May 2015, they changed my billing date without telling me. My bill was $614 so I turned in my cable equipment and asked them to stop all services then the bill dropped to $340, but according to my account they are still charging for a service we dont have access to. They told us it was going to take that $340 plus a reconnection fee to get my internet back this was June 8th, 2015. Now its June 16th, 2015 a week later and the bill is well over $600 again within a week. They will not tell us why, they will not answer any of our questions. It's nearly impossible to get a hold of billing to figure out why my bill that is supposed to be $99 keeps being raised. They've ruined all other options for internet in my area. I was on the phone with them for hours this morning trying to get them to terminate my service, and they're refusing to do so which makes my bill even higher and I'm in even more debt. I am disabled and on a fixed income I cannot afford this debt on my head. I am leaving my daughters email in the email field, this becomes to stressful and worsens my condition so she deals with all of this.

 On June 5th 2015 unauthorized activity occurred on my Comcast account. On Saturday June 6, 2015 I agreed to make arrangements to pay $102.05.
 On June 9,10,& 11, Comcast has tried to take out the amount I have agreed to pay on the 13th of June which developed a $96 fee from my bank. On June 12th Comcast has tried to pull from my account. Because of this problem , I paid $105 to Comcast on Sunday June 14th instead of Saturday June 13th. The following Tuesday , June 16 my services were suspended. I spoke with a representative to restore my services and I was told that they needed my checking information to do so , which I did not agree with because of the unnecessary activities taken place on my bank account from Comcast. In result, I now have to create a new bank account and cancel my services with Comcast. I need clarification before i cancel .

 I spent a total of 4 hours trying to get to collections, never being able to speak to them. I was lied to, I was put on hold for hours on end, I was transferred to departments that could not help, and hung up on multiple times.
 Today, I spoke to someone claiming to be in the ""Collections"" department. They claim that they are unable to make the arrangement, even though it's in the notes, and that I already know it is possible.
 They are lying, when you catch them lying they put you on hold and never pick back up. They hang up on you, and simply don't care.
 These are basic utilities that are not to be blocked. As Comcast is the sole cable company, refusing to take my payments is therefore blocking me from my service.
 I have tried to make payments, I have tried to set up arrangements, yet keep getting the run-around.
 The last person I spoke to: Nabien,Comcast ID: 5559, refused to transfer me to a supervisor. Refused to transfer me to another rep. Refused to take a partial payment. Lied about not being able to setup postdated payments.
 If they were not able to setup a postdated payment, I wouldn't have been offered it yesterday.
 I am tired of being hung up on constantly by this company. This is totally out of hand. Someone needs to do something about this horrible company.

975,"My Internet Bill has gone up 3 times from $39 to $55 to $79 to $87. I am moving on July 7th 2015 and had called a week ago to transfer service to my new nearby home and lower my rate back down (I thought it was $55 at the time I called). I was told there were ""no current promotions"" and that I had the lowest rate possible (little did I know my bill was about to auto deduct at $87). I have been a member with Comcast since 2008, and have had nothing but trouble. I have had to call several times over the years to get my bill lowered to the original price. No one charges $87/month for internet except Comcast! And apparently I had the ""lowest rate available"". So today I went to the website and saw they have a $19.95/month internet service. So I called today. Marie, employee ID# MY! told me again the lowest available was $50/month. I then mentioned the $19.95 and she said that's an internet only option and she couldn't get it for me. If that's true Comcast is tying their employees' hands terribly - so not only is it a terrible customer service company, it sounds like it's also a terrible company to work for. This is why if you Google ""worst company in America"" Comcast comes up as the first and only result! I then informed Marie politely that I have spent hours researching different providers and prices much cheaper than Comcast, and that I was looking at the BBB page as well as the FCC complaint page and will be filing a complaint unless she could resolve my issue. When she mentioned that she couldn't do the $19.95/month because it was ""online only"", I asked why she didn't at least tell me about it to help save me money and satisfy a long time customer. She then told me that it was because lowering to that plan would not fit my ""internet service needs"". I asked her how she knew what my needs were, and she said that I told her at the beginning of the phone call. I then asked her to tell me what it was I allegedly said (because I never told her anything - feel free to listen to the recorded call!). She claimed I said that I use internet for ""email and to watch movies"". I told her that I never said that and she said that I did! I then explained how I knew for a fact that I didn't tell her: I was waiting to answer that exact question of what I use internet for. I have learned to say I only use it for email and occasional web browsing, because if I say I watch Netflix or YouTube, then they claim the lowest 3 tiers will not be able to provide me adequate speed for those services. SO the last time I got my $39.99 rate over a year ago, I told them I just surf the web and check email. They still warned it would be too low. And guess what? I can stream Netflix on 3 different devices at once with no issues!
 After explaining all of this to her in detail, she made an excuse and said she got ""confused"". I find it funny that she was so very specific with ""what I said my internet needs were"". She straight lied to me. I'm guessing Comcast must train them to do these things! I don't think the big problem here is Maria and a one-time mistake that is the exception to the rule. No! Comcast is a terrible company who doesn't care about their customers! If they did, why would they not recommend the best ways to keep their employees happy and tell them about all of the available offers??? Why am I different from any other Comcast customer? And yet, I'm willing to bet it's hard to find two people with the same monthly plan paying the same monthly price. The squeaky wheel gets the oil -that is a terrible business plan and Comcast will be out of business soon if they keep it up. I informed Maria that I would be filing this
 complaint as well as one with the BBB and also told her to cancel my contract as of July 6th (the day before I move). Oh and by the way, like any other hard working American, I budget my money and like knowing my bill will stay the same and not jump up $30 in one month randomly (no it wasn't because my offer expired - that happened several months ago when it went from $39 to $55). Because of this, I had a payment declined. I am done with Comcast. Here is a link with other service providers in the area I am moving for much less and much better customer service: http://dsl.floridainternetproviders.com/32092-zipcode-dsl-internet-providers.html
 Here is a link for the results when you Google ""worst company in America"" only one name comes up (and it's not ATT):
 https://www.google.com/search?q=worst+company+in+America
 Desired Outcome:
 I want my bill dropped to $19.95/month with at least 50Mbps, and I want the ridiculous upcharge difference from $55 to $87 credited back to my account. I want this price guaranteed for the long haul - I don't want to have to call and threaten to leave in another 6 or 12 months! I understand prices increasing for inflation, but $87 for internet only is ripping off your customers and taking advantage of them. In order to ever stay with Comcast in the future, I want a phone call assuring me this won't happen again and that this must have been a ""rare exception"" and that Comcast actually does value loyal customers. I can and will happily take my business elsewhere.

976,"I have to call two to three times a month to get my internet reset for the last 12 months. The Internet slows down or just stops working for no reason. Comcast has sent 1 technician out about the third month of complaints about the service they will not send another technician out unless the charge me $70.00. I have replaced the wireless modem that I rent from Comcast 3 times trying to fix the problem. Once they receive a call to complain about the situation from me, I talk to customer service and all the sudden the Internet works for about 2 weeks and the problems start all over. I can't call another Internet provider for service because there is no other service providers are in the area that can provide service to my house.

 Comcast Corporate
 Office: 954-534-7067
 no reply till 3 July2015. She states in her email that I received on 3 July 2015 stating she has attempted to contact me at the phone number I provided to her. She has left no message on my voice mail stating she is trying to contact me about the lack of service and billing issues I am having with Comcast. I have called her on the the 30th of June at 5:23PM, the 1st of July at 3:29PM, the 2nd of July at 2:00PM and the 3rd of July at 9:56AM and 11:34AM. No one at Comcast is willing to contact me verbally. I have finally have a appointment for a technician on the 5th of July 2015 after I talked to
 a William and Kevin and was finally willing to set up a appointment to try and fix my Internet issue. This still leaves the issue with my billing issues with Comcast. My ticket number from her (Comcast) is 1977495. I have already filed a complaint with the FCC ticket number of 365879.
 Thank you for any help with dealing with Comcast.

980,"I recently moved and cut back on my services with Comcast to only receive their internet service (and I purchased my own modem). I was repeatedly told that all I would have to do was call and activate my new modem when I arrived at my new address. I have now called 9 times over the past 4 days and have received the worst customer service I have EVER experienced. On 4 of these calls, I have been disconnected - sometimes more than an hour into the call. Although some representatives have asked me for my phone number to contact me in case we are disconnected, no one has actually followed through on this.
 I still have no internet service at my new home, and no one has been able to tell me why or resolve any issues with activating the non-Comcast modem. At this point I am paying for a service that Comcast has not been able to provide me, and no one has a solution for. I have asked to have someone come to the home to troubleshoot, but they have not let me book an appointment (I was disconnected during this call). I have spent more than 5 hours on the phone, with no resolution. Unfortunately Comcast is my only viable option for internet, so I am stuck with continuing to deal with this issue, despite their completely inept service.

 This issue remains unresolved. I went to the store, as someone from Comcast asked me to do. They connected my modem to my account, but we still have no service. I have tried to explain that there is no cable connected to our unit. I booked an appointment to have this resolved.
 The technician was due to arrive June 10th between 6 and 7pm. At 5:30pm, I confirmed the appointment with Comcast. When no one showed up by 7:10pm, I called. I was told the job number was 308583, and the technician number was 8341. The representative told me that the job was still open, and he would send a message to the tech letting him know we were home and waiting. No one
 came. I called again at 8:30pm, and was told that the technician said he stopped by at 6:20pm and no one was home. My entire family was home, sitting in our kitchen, beside the front door. The technician NEVER KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.
 There has been absolutely no accountability to the customer during this entire process. My only course of action was to book another appointment (which I don't believe anyone will show up to). I have requested they send us the part to connect the cable ourselves, but they have refused. At this point I have called over 12 times, I have gone to the store, I have booked an appointment, still without resolution. I am receiving bills in the mail, and no one over the phone will correct the bill due to the fact that I have no service. I am being asked to pay for a service that comcast has not even been able to provide to me. This behavior is unethical, unacceptable, and completely disrespectful of the customer."
981,"Since December the services (phone & internet) problems have been getting worse. I have been
 without service for 10 days 12/2014. I had to buy calling cards for my cell phone to contact Comcast.
 10 scheduled appointments were made and not one did they showed up for. I gave them my cell
 phone number to contact me and not once did they call to let us know they would not be here. We
 have cameras on the house and checking our records no one has been to our house. Comcast told
 us they were here between 10 to 3 and our cameras show no one has been to our house. In January
 we had a tech who replaced the modem because he was unable to get internet service or his phone
 to work. They got the phone working but not the internet. They also called ADT to find out if that was
 an issue. ADT came out and disconnect from the Comcast service and still we were having issues.
 The phone went out no long after the tech left. Comcast changed 3 boxes and still the service doesn’t
 work. They have changed all the inside and outside wiring but never went up the pole. They said
 there was water getting in and a bad cable but the problem is still happening. I was told I can’t file a
 complaint because they are not regulated. When a tech did show up last Friday 05/08/2015 and he
 came to the door. The tech received a call and left. That is last time we seen that tech. Our cameras
 show the pole and not once did they any techs go up that pole to find the problem. Since 12/2014 this
 has been problems and still happening today. I need the service I pay for to work."
982,"Comcast charges insane prices for my internet services as well as my phone service despite both being purchased as one of their ""packages"". Additionally they charge my family to use one of their routers every month. They do not let us switch routers because of our phone service package, despite the fact that comcast representatives promised us that this would be possible. The service frequently drops and due to the poor quality router that Comcast forces us to use and charges us monthly for using it, I have to manually adjust router dhcp settings just to maintain a connection to the internet on my pcs.

They deactivated my account instead and I have been calling them ever since and no can fix my issue. They keep transferring me fr billing to tech to sales support. Such bad customer service and the guys were even racist with me. It's easy to say no one is willing to help fix the issue. There is no commitment to the cause, comcast can go back and listen to my recorded list and I demand an apology for the amount of stress I have been given.

984,"I have had several issues with Comcast over the last couple of weeks. Most of them have been
 resolved by completely eliminating the cable portion of my service. However, Comcast is the only
 broadband provider in my are. So I am unable to eliminate my internet.
 Recently,I discovered I am paying for 105 Mbps.
 I am receiving approx 23 Mbps. A Comcast technician informed me I was receiving 50 Mbps on a
 hardline and I would receive approx 1/2 that amount on a wifi device.
 Since I am only receiving 50mbps and paying for 105, I requested a refund for the difference.
 I eventually had a supervisor call me back.
 The supervisor informed me that there was absolutely no way for the phone tech to know what speed
 I was receiving. The only way to determine that was to have a tech come to the home.
 I requested that they send a tech to the home
 The supervisor informed me if they did that, I could possibly be charged a $45 fee.
 I asked if I paid for the tech and the tech verified I was only receiving 50mbps would they refund me
 the difference. She said no.
 The reason being, I had not complained about my internet speed since May of 2014.
 Is there any way for someone from the FCC can come verify my speed w/o paying $45? If verified is
 there any way to hold Comcast accountable for charging for services they are not providing?
 I have spent countless hours of being on hold, randomly disconnected, and transferred. I finally gave
 up on trying to rectify the cable part and disconnected both our Jersey and Alabama service.
 If you can assist me with dealing with this internet monopoly in any way, it would be greatly
 appreciated.

 To whom it may concern
 I'm unsure how this complaint was closed. On 6/14 a tech was suppose to install an improved router.
 At 4:00 we received a phone call that the tech was running very late,but would arrive by 6:00. At 6:30
 I left to go to work. The tech never arrived and no one has contacted us or followed up. Please advise
 how this was closed.
 Thank you

I called up Comcast they gave me reference no 029-236-360 and they promised me full investigation and refund. Today morning I got a call from and they told me they are doing ar doing are doing refund for 12 months only I objected to it. Dawn the service rep was rude and very violent. I recently had a brain surgery and this caused me severe depression and mental strain. I called again and the new supervisor told me I will get refund for 6 months and not 12 months. He didn't even read the previous case notes. I have likely lost around 500 dollars and more than the money very rude and incompetent customer service has caused me severe trauma and depression.

989,"I live in a pretty brand new subdivision in Wayne County that is literally just a couple miles away from the city.
 The selection of fast broadband Internet is very limited. I've noticed Comcast and AT&T expanding their Internet service in surrounding counties with much faster speeds. I was wondering if their was anything you may could do to help encourage these companies to expand or increase their services? The subdivision I currently live in has 5 brand new homes with a projected 50-60 in the coming months.
 From what I have been able to find out, I am less than a ½ mile from the nearest Comcast service box. I have made multiple calls and sent several emails trying to see if Comcast service could be installed at my home.
 My home address is | Jesup, Georgia 31545 (Located in Magnolia Creek Subdivision. Right across from PineCrest cemetery off of Highway 169. Red Hill Road is literally less than a block from my house.
 I've reached out to local government officials to see if they could help, but that has not been successful thus far.

990,"To whom it may concern,
 I am a U.S. Army Special Forces Officer, assigned to 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), and I am writing to you today to explain the circumstances surrounding a grievance I am currently experiencing with the local Comcast Service Center (2400 Franklin Pike, Nashville, TN 37204) in the hope that you or your office may be able to facilitate a resolution.
 Prior to purchasing the property located at , Joelton, TN 37080 for a new home, I personally visited the Comcast Service Center to ensure the serviceability of the property as my wife requires the capability to work from home and to ensure she had adequate security measures (monitoring service thru internet connectivity) in place during my frequent absences. The Comcast Service Center assured me that establishing service to a new residence at that location would not present an issue; a substantial consideration when researching potential home sites.
 Following the purchase of the property and the beginning of home construction, on 11 DEC 2014, I returned to the Comcast Service Center to once again verify serviceability and determine how to coordinate the home builder and Comcast installers to have service lines installed without duplicating efforts. I was once again assured that service installation would not present an issue and was instructed that when the home builder was ready to open the trench to lay the underground power to the home, I was to return to the Comcast Service Center to coordinate for the Comcast installers to install the service line.
 I returned to the Comcast Service Center to coordinate for the installation and was issued Trouble Ticket (1) 027920214. Two weeks passed and no response from the Comcast Service Center. I returned to the Comcast Service Center and after some substantial research and deliberation, it was determined that my trouble ticket had been closed due to a lack of infrastructure to enable service to the new home. I requested to speak with the service manager and was informed that she was not available but would contact me at the first opportunity.
 The service manager contacted me that evening and explained that a lack of signal strength prevented service to my new home. I explained that I had been reassured on several instances that service would not be a problem and requested a solution to establishing service to my new home. She stated it would cost $100,000.00 to build the necessary infrastructure to establish service. An obscene number which I assumed was used to expedite the end of the discussion and prevent further interaction with me as making the situation seem hopeless. I requested an actual cost estimate be provided and not be given an arbitrary figure. The service manager stated she would provide an (b) (6)
 actual cost estimate within the next few days as I was preparing for another deployment and needed to reach a resolution prior to my departure.
 During this time period, I petitioned my neighbors if they were interested in acquiring Comcast service. They all responded with affirmation and I was able to collect thirteen signatures covering the less than a mile gap in the Comcast coverage. A week had passed and the Comcast Service Center failed to contact me and so I visited them personally. The service manager was unavailable and the customer service representatives could not determine the status of Trouble Ticket (1): 027920214. The customer service representative stated that the only thing they could do was to issue another Trouble Ticket in order to have the service manager contact me with an update, Trouble Ticket (2): 028468310. The customer service representative also stated that she would personally follow up with me to ensure the issue was resolved prior to my departure. I neither received a response to Trouble Ticket (2): 028468310 nor from the customer service representative prior to my departure.
 In May, I deployed to a combat zone and attempted to resolve the issue through Comcast Executive Customer Relations. I was quoted $58,825.00 to establish service and was told I was outside of Comcast's service area. All of my follow up questions went unanswered to include: how am I outside Comcast's service area when there is service all around me, and why I was not provided this information when I asked prior to purchasing the property? Comcast Executive Customer Relations reiterated that they had done all they can and would not establish service without the necessary payment.
 I bring this to your attention now because I feel that I have exhausted all available options for customer service at Comcast. I understand that Comcast is a for profit business, but I did my due diligence prior to purchasing the property and relied on Comcast to be accurate in their assessment of establishing service to my residence. It is dishonest for Comcast to state that establishing service would not be an inconvenience and then attempt to extort $58,825.00 after I have purchased the property and built a home.
 I want to thank you in advance for any help you or your office may be able to provide.
 Respectfully,
 Assistant Detachment Commander

998,"The reason I am contacting your agency is because I have not been able to get a satisfactory
 resolution from Comcast. I am constantly having to call in due to service issue which always results
 in me having to reset something on my end which takes too much time. The last time I checked, I was
 not employed by Comcast but it seems I end up doing as much work as their employees. Many times
 I have called in to follow-up and there is no documentation of my calls. After being without service for
 nearly a day and then having the same issue the following Monday, I was promised a $60 credit on
 my next bill. When I received my bill, it was not reflected on my bill. I called and spoke with a
 supervisor by the name of Ceasar and he advised me that Comcast would have never offered me
 $60 because ""I am not a business"". I do not like being called a liar. I did not make this up. The
 representative had even stated that she was entering the credit as we were on the phone. I advised
 Ceasar as I had advised the previous rep that I telecommute 4 days a week for my job and totally rely
 on internet service to perform all of my job functions because it is web-based. He did not seem to
 care and went on to say that he did not find any documentation of that nor could he find my call. He
 told me that if I could provide him with proof he would be glad to further investigate. I asked him what
 kind of ""proof” I could provide if he is stating he has no record of my call in the first place. Often times,
 I have to speak with people who appear to be offshore which is fine as long as we can understand
 each other; however, that is not the case. I have had service calls scheduled that I did not agree and
 made it clear that I would not be available at that time. I was told that I would need to call a different
 department and cancel the call myself. I feel this is unfair and customers should receive the service
 they are paying. It doesn't seem to be improving as I still have service interruptions. They are always
 trying to force you to trouble shoot everything yourself. I think this is unacceptable because I am
 paying for the service and you are asking me to do more work than you appear to be willing to do
 yourself. The drop-down below only allows one selection, but I would like it noted that this is billing
 and service (Availability)."
999,"I had called Comcast to cancel service, I am moving my office to the city I reside in and Comcast doesn't service this area. I was then informed that I had signed up for a 36 month contract and if I cancelled I would be responsible for the cancellation. I live in McDonough Ga and my office is in Jonesboro Ga. I never signed a contract nor was I at my office when the technicion came to do the hook up. My daughter had did all the corresponding with Comcast. I've spoken to several rude people at Comcast and no one is trying to help me. How can I be responsible for something that I never signed and my daughter states that she read over all the document that she had signed and there wasn't anything about a 36 month contract of the service.

1000,"I have a complaint with Comcast. It is the only cable option I have and I am completely unsatisfied with them. From day 1 of signing up with them, they have got everything wrong when it comes to charging me. First they did not sign me up with the correct package that I requested. They did not give me the correct equipment that was asked for. My first account was deleted and an unknown second account was started which created more problems. this was all within the first day of signing up for cable and internet. Once I received my bill, it was incorrect with charges I specifically asked that would not be on my billing statement. After multiple phone conversations with customer service, nothing was resolved. I was passed around between different departments stuck in limbo and no one could help me. The eventually turned me over to their internet chat site that they said could help me. After having a long conversation explaining my incorrect bill, they said they would fix it and I would not have to worry. Weeks later I get another bill with the same statement that has not been fixed and a new statement with more charges than the last one. I called one final time requesting it to be fixed letting them know I have intentions to file a claim against them and letting them know I have documentation saying this would be resolved and nothing was done. Immediately I was transferred to someone that did change my bill, but was still took arguing. My complaint is basically, my bill was wrong and it was their mistake and they would not fix it and give me false information. I felt my contract was breeched with this false information and the customer service was absolutely no help. The customer service was more to see how they spoke to me rather that helping me with my issue. This is not ok and it has not even been a month since I signed up with them. I would like help with this monopoly of a company not to take advantage of me.

1001,"I've been a Comcast customer for 15 years in the building I currently live in. I recently moved from
 one apartment in this building to another in the same building. I brought all of my Comcast equipment
 with me to the new apartment and hooked everything up, and everything worked fine, including my email.
 I called Comcast to officially change my address (which was only a change of apartment
 number), and Comcast told me I needed to go in person to make the change. I went in person like
 they told me, and the Comcast attendant told me that to change the address Comcast needed to
 close my existing account and open up a new account for the new address. I said this was fine, but
 made it clear that it was very important that I kept my e-mail address, and Comcast assured me that I
 could keep it and that there would be no problems.
 My e-mail address continued to work for almost a month after my initial in-person visit, until it
 stopped. All of my family's Comcast e-mails stopped working. I called Comcast, and they told me all
 of my e-mail accounts would be up and running within 24 hours and that Comcast would follow up
 with a phone call. 24 hours later the email accounts still didn't work and I received no call. Then my
 wife called the next day at around 9 am and they told her that the accounts were being worked on
 and that the accounts would be fixed by noon. They also said she would receive a call from Comcast
 following up. She also received no call, and the accounts still didn't work. So I called again the same
 afternoon and was on the phone with someone from Comcast for about an hour. He was working on
 the issue for a while until the call dropped. Noone from Comcast called me back, and of course it's
 impossible for me to speak to the same Comcast representative simply by calling back. So I called
 again the next day (today), and the Comcast representative told me that she sees my issue has been
 ""escalated,"" but that there was nothing she could do and no guarantee of how long it would take. She
 also explained to me that any previous guarantees of having the issue fixed within 24 hours or any
 specific period of time were wrong, and that the issue takes as long as it takes. She also said that it
 was unlikely anyone would call me back because they only call if they need to.
 The bottom line is that I feel completely helpless. I need my e-mail account as soon as possible, and
 the answers I get from Comcast are that the issue will resolve itself at some undetermined point in the
 future and that there's nothing I can do. But at this point I've heard so many inconsistent things from
 all of the various Comcast representatives, so I don't know what to believe and don't know where else
 to turn. I don't expect I'll be a Comcast customer much longer, but I think there's value in bringing
 these kinds of issues to your attention to protect consumers in the future. It also would be nice to get
 access to my e-mail account, at least for a brief period of time, before I cancel my service with
 Comcast and hopefully never have to deal with them again."
1002,"I called Comcast on Easter Sunday to set up internet service in my home. After speaking with a representative for a long time, I was delighted to find that my installation would be completely free. Subsequently, my confirmation email indicated I would be paying $59.99 for installation. I called Comcast and spoke with a different representative a few days later, and she told me that the installation was not free and it would never be free. I was explicitly told when I ordered the service that my installation would be free. Very deceptive and fraudulent.

 on April 5th, 2015, I called Comcast to set up service for my new home. I was told that my installation would be free. When I receive the email confirmation, I was being charged $39.99 for the technician and $10 for one type of installation and $10 for another type of installation, totaling $59.99, a huge amount compared to the fact that I was told this would be free.
 I called customer service yesterday, April 7, and complain about the discrepancy. This representative told me that no my technician and installation charges were not free. I explained that I was explicitly told that my installation would be free. There was nothing she could do for me.

 Comcast service personnel to fix problem and unable to do so. Second time personnel serviced my home he found that the wiring for the internet and cable was old and outdated. Cable wiring was from Adelhia hich Comcast bought years back. Rep then explained to me what he had done how he had to rewire house and that another company would come out to bury cable. From then on the internet has worked without problems. Now Comcast wants to charge me 39.95 plus tax for this service. Now no one ever mentioned that I would be charged. When contacted Comcast for a credit they said 'NO"". Never mind all the months I paid for internet which I never received.

1011,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was $99 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 69 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 1 and a half years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over $79 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. At this time, no other Internet service providers offer service in my Subdivision (it is a newer community in Katy TX.

1014,"Good afternoon,
 This message is in relation to unfair billing practices currently in place by Comcast. Due to Comcast being the only high speed cable option in the area, they're currently charging me $70 a month for 25mb speed, the same price the Google charges for their 1G fiber package. Surely fiber is more expensive to maintain and results in a higher bill, so why am I subject to paying the same amount for older, slower, intermittent service? DSL providers in the area offer 20mb for $20 but unfortunate are not copper cable lines.
 I would simply like a fair price for a fair product.
 Thank you for your time,

Around this time last year her internet was shut off and she called Comcast to see what the issue was. Comcast wanted her to pay about $75 for the tech to come which the consumer said she didn’t have money to do so they wanted to upsell her services in a protection policy for the visit to be free. She said she didn’t want it and after hanging up with the rep her service was turned back on. She realized that service was a tactic to get more money out of her. Now a year later she had the same issue. Right now she said that she needs the internet because she uses it for her business and her kids need it for school but was shut off again. She called the company to see what the issue was and they tried to upsell her services again which she declined. After getting off the phone with the company her service was turned back on. As a resolution she would like to see that Comcast is not able to continue this fraud. She doesn’t think they should be able to take advantage of people. ***CTR 354-phone***

 started.
 My internet connection was down about 7 days in March it was fixed March 12th .
 2 weeks later April 1st connection was down again. Tech came 4/4 fixed it.
 With in 16 hrs the connection was down again. Called customer service they set another appointment
 told me I will be reimbursed for the days with out service. And be given a credit since it is a recurring
 issue. Tech came 4/11 fixed the connection 2 hours after he left connection was down again. Mean
 while I emailed his supervisors with no response. The latest technician’s appointment was scheduled
 for April the 25th in which the problem was fixed. When I called numerous times about my bill I was
 shuffled around
 And no calls were returned by managers as promised. It came to the point my phone was blocked
 when I would call Comcast I will get disconnected immediately.
 I was never credited for the week in March or for the 25 days of no internet connection in April. I was
 charged 70$ for a technician visit even though the problem was never resolved. I emailed
 supervisors, filed official complaints with no reply. I had to get a mobile hot spot to be able to use an
 internet connection. No matter how many times I call, no matter how many times they promises to
 credit my account for lack of usage they lied and over charged me for services definitely not

 service with me to my new house at , Kennesaw GA 30144. Upon putting in a
 move request Comcast informed me it would cost another $200 to have someone come to my house
 and plug in my box for me. I told them this was unacceptable and that I could do it myself. They
 refused to budge on price and tried to upsell me on additional services and still charge me an install
 fee. It's now been 5 months that I'm paying for a service I don't use. I've asked for supervisor call
 backs and have even spoken to customer care with no follow up. Samantha Frazier was one of the
 reps that offered me additional services in addition to discounting my install fee by $50. At this point I
 tried to disconnect and was told that it would be a $900 early termination fee. I've had nothing but

My data usage is well above normal. I have called Comcast to see if there was any way to increase the data cap. They told me that their policy applies to all customers. However, their usage documentation states that I can stream Xfinity on demand content without it affecting my data cap. So why can I use their service without affecting the data cap but cannot use competing companies for media content. It seems to me that this is the definition of Anti-Competitive practices.

1021,"Comcast is the only provider for cable TV and Internet in my area. My monthly bill at this point (has gone up over the last 3 years form mid $80's) is $91.29. This is a bundled price for Internet and TV and though I have their TV service I do not use it. I was told if I was to sign up for just Internet my price would be more. I pay $12 for this unused TV service they call Blast. I am extremely unhappy with Comcast and their price. They make exclusive deals with city officials in which I am sure city official benefit in some way form or sort and make us pay outrageous prices for sub-standard service with bandwidth caps and visible slowdown on streaming video and services like Netflix. Comcast service in the past has gone out in my area for a couple of days and us as users were not given any good-will and had to just deal with the service outage. If my power goes out I dont have to pay for days not used but for my overpriced internet I do. I really feel as part of making them accountable their pricing structure should be reviewed as well. If google is able to offer similar service for half the price, Comcast has not reason to price gouge its customers but it can because they are allowed to monopolize across cities and counties. The long and short of it is, given current speeds either we as users should be charged half of what we pay or our speeds should be doubled.

1022,"Good morning,
 About 3-4 months ago, Comcast upped my rate by $40 a month for the same rate of speed. They agreed to give me a cheaper rate with the same speed. I found out a month later that they reduced my rate of speed and then cut my bill after promising me that I would still receive the same bill.
 Comcast is cheating me out of my promised internet speed, and when I called, they refused to do anything about it. I have been paying the same rate for quite some time, and then they jacked my price up just because they can and there is no competition at my household.
 I have unfortunately had to be a Comcast customer for the 8 years that I have lived in Georgia, and it is a constant battle with them to be treated fairly. I am tired of being treated unfairly by their unethical business practices and terrible customer service.

1024,"This is absolutely outrageous. I never heard about this even being a thing until I got an automated phone call that sounded like a spam call telling my I am getting close to my limit. WHY do I even have to have a limit?!?! I go over it ever single month and there is no way for my to get UNLIMITED amount of internet usage out of them. My understanding is that this is only for certain areas as well (me being Atlanta). I would NOT have gone with Comcast if I knew that they were going to try and scam me out of ever penny they have. I want UNLIMITED internet just as most other internet companies provide. And I love the fact that nothing was explained to me about any limit what so ever as I was getting the service. As I have said I go over every single month and they want to charge me extra every time I go over.... absolute bullshit.
 NO ONE that actually uses their internet as most people do today would be able to stay under that cap.....

1025,"I am a person who does not have cable television. As such, I play a lot of downloaded games (from Steam, Origin and the Xbox Marketplace) and watch a lot of shows and movies (from Netflix, Hulu and network websites) and have already hit my data cap in my first full month of service only 26 days into the month! I currently live by myself and I have no clue what is going to happen when I get married this next year. My fiance will be a nurse at that time and we will have very different working hours. I can imagine we will be watching shows and movies and playing games on our own (meaning our service will effectively be used around the clock) while the other is asleep which means I do not see this issue getting better. In addition, she loves listening to internet radio and uploading photos and videos.
 Further, I am wanting to start backing up my computer to cloud-based storage to augment my local backup and I already know that I will want to do the same with hers. As it stands, our combined backups would take two entire months worth of allotted data!
 As long as the usage of the provided service does not violate the law or the ToS (for example, addressing not running a server for public use out of your house), it has absolutely no place in a country that is pushing connectivity and availability of data. The 300GB cap is a slap to the face by Comcast who does not in any way inform your of the cap when you sign up for their service and, if nothing else, is a very outdated figure generated for a time when internet usage was not as commonplace as it is today. Since internet usage increases day by day with the quality of content always rising, I fear data caps will be slow to adjust to meet these new demands.

1030,"For almost 4 years Comcast internet service in Key West, FL has been fraught with service outages. Comcast has been contacted hundreds of times and nothing improves. Comcast VP Tom Karinshak has been contacted
 numerous times about this issue and nothing improves. Lately, Comcast does not even acknowledge the service issue messages which are sent.
 The following message was sent to Mr. Karinshak on April 25 and no confirmation or reply has been sent to date. Additionally, this morning, April 29, there was ANOTHER extended internet service outage, and when I called comcast to have the outage confirmed representative Fabian gave me the number CR457758956. Is anyone at Mr. Karinshak's office going to take the time to respond?
 Following is the original message from April 25:
 PLEASE DELIVER THIS FEEDBACK TO MR. KARINSHAK PERSONALLY. I have contacted Mr. Karinshak's office numerous times over the past two to three years about serious problems with the Key West, FL comcast service, primarily internet problems. Almost two years ago, I dropped all comcast services except internet service because of unresolved service problems - I can live without cable, I cannot live without reliable internet service. In the past 30 days, I have experienced at least ELEVEN internet outages. This past Thursday, 04/23, FOUR outages. Yesterday, Friday, 04/24, FIVE outages. For each outage, I immedialy call comcast at 800-266-2278 to confirm the outage with the recording announcing there are service outages in the area and service is expected to be restored by such and such a time, usually between 3 and 4 hours. The next day, I call comcast again to request a credit for lost service. The total number of outages experienced over the past two to three years, I would guess between 50 and 75, possibly more, is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. There have been and continue to be serious problems with the comcast system in Key West and I have to believe NO ONE at comcast in Key West, and up the comcast chain of command, is able to or cares to get to the bottom of continuing outages and other service issues in Key West. It is time for high level comcast officials to take a serious look at comcast service in Key West so the system here can be fixed so your customers here will receive reliable service with a minimum of service outages. This is not new problem, it has been going on for years. PLEASE DO SOMETHING! A copy of this feedback is being sent to the FCC along with another complaint to the FCC at consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us

 This complaint is an addition to FCC ticket number 263777 which was sent to the FCC earlier this month concerning excessive internet outages. Yesterday, Thursday, May 7, 2015, another internet outage, this time a very long outage, occurred in Key West, FL. The outage began at approximately 7:10pm and ended at approximately 11:35pm, an outage of almost 4 1/2 hours. This outage left me without internet service, and upon checking with other comcast customers by telephone, it appears this outage was island-wide for both residential and business comcast internet and other services customers, effecting thousands of customers. Whenever there is an outage, once service is restored I call comcast to get a credit for lost service. Numerous calls during the past 30 days have resulted in credits approaching $60. I do not have any other comcast services other than internet, having dropped cable tv two years ago because of numerous ourages and terrible comcast service. THOUSANDS of other comcast customers served by the Key West comcast service are deprived of service because of service outages with comcast services. With the equipment comcast uses to provide and monitor its service, comcast KNOWS when this customer and other Key West comcast customers experience an outage. However, it is necessary for a customer to make a call to request this credit, frequently a very time-consuming task. Because of numerous and also extended comcast service outages, and because comcast KNOWS when each customer is deprived of service, the FCC should consider REQUIRING comcast to automatically issue a service credit for each service outage to each customer deprived of service. Only when comcast is required to issue automatic deprivation of service credits, MIGHT comcast get its act together, and begin to provide customers with reliable internet and other service. I hope the FCC will seriously conside ordering comcast to automatically apply credits to customers accounts for lost service. Once again, comcast KNOWS when each customer has an outage. I know this because a few months ago, there was a extended power outage in Key West which shut down my comcast modem resulting in no internet service. Within 30 minutes, I receivied a telephone call from a comcast representative telling me my modem had been detected as going off-line, and the person asked if there was a problem with comcast equipment here. I informed the person that a city-wide power outage caused the internet modem to go off-line. The modem was connected to a UPS but its power eventually drained because of the extended power outage. comcast KNOWS with its monitoring electronics when a customers internet (and other) service experiences an outage, and should be required to give customers AUTOMATIC credits for lost service."

Comcast removed some of their channels and never said a word, they had to call and require about the first bill, the amount was over $400.00. Ms. Kruskie stated the bill too high that she is unable to pay it. She only orders internet and TV. Comcast took away channels and said nothing to the Kruskies. They were told if you don't like the service you can go some other place. The consumer only had the service for 2 months. She doesn’t understand the charges and fees with no explanation

Comcast came out and told us we needed to have a cable line dug. At this point, someone dropped the ball. We have spent going on three weeks attempting to explain our situation and receive service. They keep sending the wrong people and misinforming us about what will be happening. We have called multiple times and spoken with three different managers. At one point the managers didn't even call us back, even within the 24 hour window. They have told us incorrect information about installation practices and have impeded our ability to receive service. Multiple times we have left work only to find out they sent the wrong team. We require Internet for both our jobs and this company is effecting our preformance. This has also resulted in a higher cell phone bill because we are having to buy extra data to complete our work. No one is fixing our problem and we feel our problems are being ignored.

 I've been calling and complaining to Comcast for almost 3 weeks now that the internet connection is slow. Nothing has changed on my side, same modem, same wireless router and same connection. I can reboot my modem/wireless router and no change; but when I call Comcast and force them after fussing with 2 to 5 different people because we mere customers are not supposed to know anything about this; when they finally flush the line from the Comcast side everything speeds up and I'm able to have full service. This tells me the problems are on Comcast side and not mine.
 They are sending a technical person but they said they have to charge me for the visit. That is the biggest load of crap I've ever heard. If my modem/router were the problem, then when they flush the line from their side it wouldn't speed up or change; but it does. Therefore it isn't my modem/router and it is something from the CO/Switches on the Comcast side; but they have to send a technical person and charge me for it.
 I want any and all charges for the technical service call to be reversed and I want my internet services restored to the high-level I've been paying for. I also expect that for every day I don't have full internet services that I don't have to pay full price and that means Comcast needs to be discounting my daily service amount based on the level of services they are providing. Since I'm paying for premium internet and they are delivering sub-standard speeds; I should only have to pay for sub-standard prices or deeply discounted costs. Receive payment for what you deliver!

 I've had to call Comcast every day this week because the line speed is so slow that I cannot get to any page that has not already cached. I'm tired of faulty service and over-crowding at the CO/Switches where Comcast has over-sold the area and not yet increased capacity in the area.

 Customers can't be forced to pay a premium for faster speeds when I don't get normal speeds much less the speeds I'm paying extra for.

1039,"I went on my mobile phone to identify options in my area. Found a 150Mbps option for $50/m I thought sounded reasonable. I called in to set this up and the agent repeated the information back and forth as we discussed available options. I agreed to sign up for 150Mbps @ 50/m for hte first 12 months.
 I run a speedtest every couple days and I am getting no more htan 95Mbps. I engage a chat agent on this and after a very long trial and error session am told that my account is set up for 105Mbps. I ask for this to be corrected. Fast forward 3 escalations and 4 hours later and I am told that htis might be resolved within 24 hours.
 I have very little confidence this will be resolved and am frustrated at the inability of a company to correct its mistakes. There seems to be no ability on the agents side to resolve my problem and I'm questioning whethe Comcast even cares. They now say I can get 150Mbps internet speeds if I sign up for $114.99 service cost per month. This isn't what I agreed to and isn't what was advertised. It isn't even about the pricing or hte service. 105 is fine. It is the principle that I was sold something and the ngiven something else. And when confronted on this agents essentially told me I was wrong and that I made a mistake. All the information I've ever been given was directly from Comcast!
 It's embarrassing to think a company is so inept that to get an issue resolved I have to resort to an FCC complaint. It pains me to think what I'll have to deal with once billing begins later this month or once they attempt to incorporate a data cap. I would love to leave Comcast, but no other options in my area. Bleh.
 I spent nearly a full working day trying to resolve this issue. I gave Comcast an opportunity to correct this. Now I feel it is necessary to file a complaint. I've attached hte advertised prices and the 3 hour chat log. Additionally, I spent over an hour on the phone after that.

 I am a subscriber for the cable company Comcast/Xfinity. The service I ordered is Blast Internet service, which Xfinity stated that it will go up to 50mbps. From the date that I ordered the service, which is about August 2014 to today (6/29/2015), it has never gone up to 50mpbs. When I tested the service it averaged only around 17mbps.

1042,"I currently have an internet service account with Comcast. Someone calling from Comcast offered my a higher speed with cable for 29.99 per month. I just received my bill which is 39.95. I called Comcast twice to see why I was not being charged the price I agreed to. Both times, they said they could do nothing about it and the price I was told was not even being offered. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told one would contact me in 48 hours. I was never contacted back.

1043,"This is a 2-part complaint.
 The first is the data cap imposed by Comcast as a ""trial"" basis in select cities. They only notified users by email, which is often their Comcast email, not their personal one. At the time I signed up for service, to my recollection, I was not allowed to make my personal email the preferred method of contact. It was not an email I requested and I was not intending on using it at all. If I had checked it, which I had no reason to do, I would have seen the notification about the overage.
 Comcast allows 3 ""grace"" months going over the 300GB cap, after which any month with an overage will generate a charge of $10 per 50GB even if only a few kilobytes above the monthly limit. I was unaware of the cap due to this reason, and only became aware with a bill including overage charges. This overage was during Feb 2015 when our area (and much of the eastern seaboard) was in an ice/snow period and many people were inside for days. A guest in my house apparently watched Netflix 24 hours a day and caused the very significant overage. (about 321GB over the cap i was unaware of). According to Comcast records in my account, these 321GB took place between 2/20/15-2/28/2015.
 I have been in computer science since 1970 and very well understand network issues. In addition, my work has earned a Technical Grammy in the field of digital audio and I understand ""trial"" and ""beta"" versions. However, we did not penalize our testers, as Comcast is doing. The ""trial"" they are conducting is simply to see how many complaints they get before attempting to roll out data caps nationwide. Some people have commented that Comcast only puts data caps in where they have little competition at speed/price points.
 As the FCC has ruled that the internet is a utility, net neutrality is ensured (for now) and Comcast is simply going after anyone who is using data (and assuming they are doing so to watch Netflix, etc.) Comcast refuses to refund the overage and refuses to acknowledge their very sketchy communication with their internet subscribers in these ""trial"" cities, listed here: Huntsville and Mobile, Alabama; Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah, Georgia; Central Kentucky; Maine; Jackson, Mississippi; Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; Charleston, South Carolina; Tucson, Arizona. [http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-trials/] My request is that the FCC look into this data cap issue, evaluate the fairness of such a ""trial"" practice, and determine what is best for the marketplace.
 The second part of the complaint is related to Comcast's interference with the free market. As I have Comcast cable internet at the time of writing (50Mbps down, 12Mbps up), I was interested in finding out about AT&T fiber-based service. I felt that if I subscribed to AT&T and Comcast simultaneously, I
 could see if AT&T's fastest-available speeds (18Mbps/1.5Mbps) and somewhat lower cost was offset by the dedicated speed, as Comcast suffers from speed lag during heavy neighborhood usage. After an hour of going over details with AT&T, the customer support person came back after a consultation, vexed that she could not order the installation because Comcast leases some lines from AT&T as part of their network and AT&T was barred from installing any internet service into the same physical residence. Only after Comcast was totally disconnected could AT&T install their fiber-system. This was a rather unpleasant fact to discover, and I can only imagine it is due to a contractual limitation demanded by Comcast when leasing the lines (a portion of the DSL infrastructure) from AT&T. This makes it *impossible* for a consumer to evaluate the services and make an informed decision without substantially interfering with their internet service as there's no way to guarantee service from both companies in the same day. In addition, it would require an additional financial investment to try AT&T out, and possibly have to go back to Comcast (reconnection fees, etc.). In addition, I may not get the same price I have now for Comcast, etc. This is market interference, and the consumer has no idea that Comcast is leasing data trunks from AT&T to make their service work, nor that they can not have both services in the same residence. I request the FCC to evaluate this interference in the free market, especially in a market with few choices (Knoxville, TN).

Since there were no internet signal I called the Comcast customer Service. After a few tests over the phone, Comcast scheduled a Service Appointment for Mars 30th. The technician found a connection problem outside of my apartment. This was outside of the ""Demarcation Point"" which begins 12 inches outside the customer’s residence. Repair and maintenance beyond the Demarcation Point is the responsibility of Comcast. Now I have a $40 bill regarding a InHome

 Hi, I'm sorry for the trouble but glad you got it opened and served. I have more to add, as I've canceled my account with Comcast in two stages. April 30, 2015 canceled internet, May 11,2015 canceled my cable tv. On May 23,2015 I got my final statement for eleven days in May, statement said due by June 13,2015, I sent a check for $30.90 on May 26, 2015, the check was posted May 28, 2015, and I have a print-out of the check that cleared my bank on May 29,2015. Now comes the fun with Comcast, they had turned by account over to Focus Receivables Management in Georgia, my account is considered as ""a write--off"" and is past due according to a call to my home on May 29, 2015 at 4:37 pm, well imagine my surprise, I pay the bill via USPS, due to the fact that they have deleted my account, so can't pay on-line, call me a write-off the same day my check for the full account due clears my bank. On May 30,2015 I had a conversation with Tyler at Eastern Accounts System, Comcast collections company, I'm told, so this is the run-down of my account, as he states it from his computer screen: 5/23/2015, my account was posted as delinquent/past-due, 5/27/2015, my account is posted as ""write-off"" in the amount of $30.90, on 5/28.2015, my account shows ""recovered"" in the amount of $30.90, and check was posted to my account, my account now shows, $0 due, but, he won't send any documents as to this statement he just gave me, I have to go to the office where I canceled and returned my equipment, I'm stunned by now. So, I have a 30-day FCRA letter going out June 2, 2015 to Focus, by law they must respond, as they did make a telephone call (b) (6)
 to my home, and demanded payment for Comcast. I did ask Focus when they received the transmission of my over-due account from Comcast, they stated, ""today, May 29,2015"", I did inform them that my check had cleared my bank and to remove my telephone number from their system and not to call again. so, I go to Comcast office today and get ""your account is $0, and they won't print out the information, I need to go to Asheville Hwy. office to get that information, and I was told to leave now, I did. I hope we can get something done, I realize that to Comcast, this is business as usual, I also have two chat online dates, but later on that, if you need. I have copies of everything, but you let me know if you really do need them now.

1046,"About 3 years ago I signed up for Comcast Exfinety internet and at that time I was told my subscription was for unlimited usage. Since then about a year ago they started charging overage fees if you use more than a certain amount of data. ( 300 gb) No contract renewals were sent and no notification of service changes. I dropped cable and now they're dinging me for overages on data because I use such things as Netflix and Amazon for my TV enjoyment. Is this legal. In my opinion the ISP should be separate from cable TV suppliers for it is a conflict of interest.

1047,"Recently I took time to look at my Comcast bill. I found an unauthorized charge for internal wiring that comes to about $5 a month. I decided to go ask in person that it be removed and a refund given back to when the charge was first added and I don't even know for sure when that occurred. I auto pay my bill each month and I check the bill every couple of months or so to make sure they haven't gone up. I went to the local service center instead of calling after my last Comcast issue when I could not get help through the call center successfully. The last trip to the service center to get the issue resolved resulted in a 6 month $20 reduction in my Comcast bill but I continued to pay at the regular amount. I have $120.00 dollar overage as a result on my account. The first thing the young boy told me today (4/21/2015) was that I had already been given credit and I told him no the overage on my account was from my paying extra on my bill each month. He went on to tell me that I should check my bill more often and he could take off this month's unauthorized charge but could not credit me with any additional money but he told me I would be better off to call the call center and have them do it. He would need to leave the charge on my bill because otherwise they wouldn't refund me and in the end did not remove the unauthorized charge on this month's bill or change my account to remove it in the future. He refused to listen to anything I had to say including my issues with the call center where I was routinely switched to India. He further told me that he was sure that my attitude wasn't personal and I assure you I wasn't screaming or using curse words during this ""conversation"". I am beyond frustrated with Comcast. This is not the first billing issue we have had with them. The last time one of their salesmen showed up at the house and my mother and brother both told him that I make the decisions about the Comcast bill and he would have to talk to me. The next bill we received had cable tv added and a slower internet package added. We tried to call the ""call center"" and was told that the only person who was authorized to change the account was my father. He had been dead for over 3 years by that time. My mother and I had to take his death certificate and go to the service center to get the account changed back. We had tried to change it the time of his death but we were told my mother would lose her email if we changed it into her name. The other billing incident included charging me for a modem rental. I own my own modem and have never rented from them. It took some doing but I was finally able to get that removed. I can attached a copy of my latest bill if necessary.

1048,"Comcast has recently implemented usage based billing in the Knoxville TN area in the face of nearly zero broadband competition. The only local competitor is ATT and Charter but even combined, their footprint is significantly smaller and slower.
 What is important to note is not the implementation of usage based billing but how they implement it.
 Comcast plans come with an initial data cap of 300GB/mo. It offers a $5 discount from your monthly bill to lower your data cap to 5GB/mo. However for each 50GB over 300GB, they charge $10.
 There is the egregious difference between increasing and decreasing your data cap.
 No unlimited home plan is available.
 Assuming $50/month (approximately my internet bill) and knocking $5 off for 295GB. Makes the pricing as follows.
 Fixed cost: $44.92 Price per GB: $0.017
 That means by their own implicit valuation of their product, their markup on 50GB for $10 is 1176% and on the 6th GB of the 5 GB plan is 5582%!!!!!!!
 I would happily pay $45/month + 2¢ /GB but that's not what's on offer here.
 This level of mark up would be illegal for any other utility. Please step up and enforce abundantly available internet for all citizens.

 I have received a few call from a Faye with Comcast at 1-615-750-8969 during my work hours. When
 I have tried to return the call, voicemail EVERYTIME. A Field Manager, who lives in my
 neighborhood, stopped by my residence after intercepting the email complaint to check our
 equipment. He stated no issues, but we still have downtime with our wi-fi and different times of the
 day and we are still told that the modem is "" trying to find itself."" What kind of explanation is that and I
 am still paying for a service they advertise as fast and reliable with an all-time connection."
1050,"My Comcast service quit working in late March. I called to get if fixed, and they sent out two different
 people who came out to the house but did not fix the problem. I then cancelled my service on April 2,
 2015. When my husband returned my equipment, he asked for a detailed copy of the bill and was told
 he could not be provided one and would have to go online to get it. I went online and my online
 account had been closed by Comcast. I called to request a copy of the details of my bill and was told
 that I could not be sent another one, but one would be sent to me within 30 days of my last date of
 service. On May 1, I did finally receive a bill, but it did not include anything prior to April 2 (I was
 asking for details for March, when my service was not working). THE NEXT DAY, on May 2, 2015, I
 received a call from a collections agency stating that Comcast had reported me to collections and
 filed a report against my credit. The bill I received on May 1 (the day prior) stated that I would not be
 sent to collections unless I had not paid my final bill within 30 days of receiving it. I still do not know
 what my bill is for. I attached my letter to Comcast detailing my interactions with them since my
 internet quit working."
1051,"Recently, I found out (through my bill, and through no other avenue) that my internet is 'capped'. Not
 'capped' in the sense that it stops working or is throttled, however, my Comcast internet in Tennessee
 is limited at 300 GB/month.
 I explained to the agent on the phone that we do not have cable, nor do we wish to have cable as we
 do not want to subject my son to commercials, and I was told that Netflix and streaming video usage
 was the largest portion of my bandwidth cap-usage. The only option would be to pay for their
 television service.
 I feel like this is unacceptable and arbitrary. My internet service is already expensive enough and I
 know that they make more than enough to maintain their (admittedly poor) network in my area."
1052,"I've been a customer of Comcast , almost 5 years. I've always chosen their service due to reliability,
 speed, and price. The only other provider in my area offers a slow DSL (18Mbps) service which is too
 slow for my needs.
 Last year, Comcast started to implement a Data Cap in my area. They don't want it referred to as a
 Cap but it is nonetheless (If you have to pay to obtain 'more' then they are 'capping' you!) I feel that
 the data caps they've instituted are due to people like me who are cord cutters. I don't want television
 service as it doesn't fit what I desire out of a media provider. I only want less than 10% of the
 channels they offer and do not want to be held to their time schedule.
 I've really looked at their data cap and I've ran some math against it to see what I'm actually getting
 for what I pay for. In my area I'm paying $78.95 for their Internet Plus with Blast!. I get up to 50Mbps
 down and up to 10Mbps up. Now, I know, most wouldn't utilize 100% of their bandwidth at all times.
 So, for my math, I'll take it at 50% of the speed I pay for, 25Mbps\5Mbps.
 To set this up we'll use a 30day period or 1 month as their meters are setup for. Within a 30day
 period, at 25Mbps, one can download almost 8TB of data IF the speed were constant during that
 period. 300GB is ONLY about 4% of 8TB. So if I were to use half of what I pay for, including their
 overage fees, I'd pay around $1650 a month! But, since I've stayed within their data caps, I've only
 received 4% of what I pay for!
 I actually used up to about 2TB of data a month before they started capping me. My family does all
 media from streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, youtube, etc. I'm aggravated, as a consumer,
 that I'm being ripped off in such a fashion. There isn't a logical or logistical reason that Comcast has
 been able to offer as to why they started the caps. Add, that in these trial markets, there isn't a way
 for my to communicate my issues. I've called and their customer service reps have told me there isn't
 someone, or somewhere, to which I can make a complaint about this issue. Considering I'm ""beta""
 testing this, how do they know what their customers view is on it at all?!
 I fully feel that they've done so to attempt to recover lost revenue for users who are cord-cutters such
 as myself. I fully understand one cannot hold them accountable for the full, up to, speed for which
 they pay. But I still get a small faction of half of what I pay for and I feel something needs to be done.
 They need to end their data caps once and for all."
1053,"I am a disabled veteran and have a limited budget. Comcast has constantly been increasing my bill
 and taking away certain features if I refuse to pay more while limiting my data usage. I got a call to
 upgrade for 10$ more a month to a faster internet and have more channels, then two day later I got a
 phone call telling me my usage limit was about up. I had to pay over charges due to them increasing
 my speed so I could use data faster. Every time I call them now I use the term commycast when
 referring to them. They are also the only company that offers cable speeds in my area so I am forced
 to stay with them. Every time I talk to them I have to go through 3-4 reps before I get one that will fix a
 problem, the others will either hang up or give some line about how they cant/want help fix my
 problem. They are a monopoly and I want to join a class action law suit against them. Issues are
 Billing, speed, interference, data caps.

 Thank you for the reply. Comcast cable did contact me via phone call, I have not received a letter as
 of today. During the call with Comcast regarding my complaint, the representative lied multiple times
 to me and I have seen a decrease in my service through them. I cant prove it, but it seems they have
 put some type of limiter on my service since my call with them. I believe they are trying to punish me
 for complaining about the horrible costumer service and their over all deceitfulness service."
1054,"I was contacted by Comcast this month and informed that I went over on my data usage which is
 apparently a new cap they are implementing in my market. I went over because of streaming Netflix,
 Hulu, and cloud backups. This is unfair and frustrating because it limits my everyday life and limits my
 options for non-cable-tv entertainment."
1055,"On May 11 2015, my Comcast Business account was terminated. This was agreed upon.
 On May 19 2015, I attempted to sign up for residential service.
 When attempting to obtain service, the Residential agent told me my address was marked as a
 ""Business Account"" and I needed to call the Business team to have this removed. When I called the
 Business team, I spoke with an Agent who told me that he could not help me, but would transfer me
 to someone that could. I was on hold for over an hour and finally gave up.
 I attempted to contact a business agent via chat, was successful, but he told me I would have to
 contact residential.
 Attached is a copy of the chat transcript.
 I simply want to sign up for Residential service. Comcast is the only company in my residential area
 that provides broadband service (based on the new FCC definition)."
1056,"I had filed a complaint previously, complaining that Comcast's bandwidth caps are both unnecessary
 and arbitrary.
 Providing bandwidth costs practically nothing, and providing large amounts of bandwidth (in excess of
 300GB) cost practically nothing. Given the fact that I pay a monthly fee, I should receive this service
 completely and without limitations. Otherwise, I would be happy to pay no guaranteed monthly fee,
 but to pay a reasonable rate for my usage (similar to a utility bill).
 It is unjust and unfair to pay a monthly fee, PLUS a usage rate based on how much I go over an
 arbitrary cap. I do not have cable TV service and I do not want it as I do not wish to see commercials.
 I prefer to use services like Netflix on my Roku streaming device to view entertainment content.
 However, because I have subbed these services instead of purchasing TV service, I am now being
 penalized and charged extra, because I prefer to get my entertainment through another means. I
 would point out that Comcast still makes money from this transaction in the form of my monthly fee.
 They are not losing money from this transaction, as it is money that I would never pay them to begin
 with.
 What is more insulting is that, instead of addressing my complaint in any official manner, they had a
 low level call center employee call me and drone through a script explaining that 'it is the policy of
 Comcast that we cap our bandwidth at 300GB and anything over this amount might be viewed as
 excessive and incur an extra charge'. She did not take any of my complaints, nor listen to anything I
 had to say. When I made a point she would re-read the script and ask again if I understood the
 agreement.
 This is doubly insulting. I work from home, yet I am told that I should not do that on Comcast's
 residential services because they will not guarantee any kind of up-time. However, when I ask for
 'business class' services (which really only includes unlimited bandwidth and the option for a static IP
 address) they tell me that they cannot install it in my area because it is residential. Even though
 'business class' services are just rate-codes on my account (ex comcast employee) and do not have
 anything to do with my physical location. Couple this with the fact that I do not have a choice as to
 my internet provider. ATT U-Verse (while no better) is in a non-compete agreement with TDS
 Telecom (a local provider who does not service my area and only offers very low [sub 3mb/s]speeds).
 Verizon does not service my area, Knology merged with WoW and they do not service my area.
 My only option for broadband speed is Comcast. And Comcast knows it.
 I will file a complaint every week until a higher-level Comcast representative contacts me and will
 forward my complaints (or do something about this issue), or until such a time as the FCC has taken
 Comcast to court over bandwidth caps and won.
 I would be happy to testify on behalf of the FCC as I have detailed logs of poorly performing speeds,
 inconsistent connections, and proof of bandwidth issues and harassment stemming from those
 issues. I also have recorded calls with Comcast representatives which may be of use."
1057,"I live in the middle of a fairly large city called Knoxville but i cant choose my internet provider due to a
 ""exclusive service contract"" i have seen that the FCC has declared this practice illegal. So as a
 consumer what can I do to have an actual choice in ly internet provider. Or am I literally stuck with
 comcast and thier overage charges for anything i do in regards to internet.

 And since I have filed this complaint my internet usage is randomly jumping up. I have a metered
 connection with a 300gb data limit. Today I noticed a 30gb jump in my data usage while at work, so I
 contacted their support staff and was told ""Its not their problem that my data usage jumped while at
 work"" and if I wish to stop it, that I should ""Turn off my internet."""
1058,"I am a customer of Comcast, unfortunately. With their ""new"" data cap trial, I have almost maxed out
 the data for this month. It doubled in April. But prior to April less than 1GB was used. We are not
 using the Internet more than usual therefore it does not make sense how our data usage skyrocketed.
 I contacted comcast several times about this and their response is always that they can't do anything
 about it because they don't have access to my home network. They said it's probably a malfunction in
 my modem but they can't help. I am about to change to another provider that has no cap but wanted
 to file a complaint first with FCC. I also want to add that I am deaf therefore many things I do require
 Internet use such as making phone calls via video phone or internet relay. This cap is not reasonable
 for deaf customers."
1059,"Comcast is continuing to block access to my HBO account through my two PlayStation devices (PS3/PS4). This appears, to me, to be in violation of the Open Internet Order. If I am in error, please let me know.

1060,"I am a current Comcast customer in Knoxville, TN and I am now subject to a 300GB data cap on my home internet. I pay Comcast almost $200/month in fees for cable and internet. My wife and I enjoy using Netflix and we also subscribe to HBO via Comcast but we like using HBOGO better. Comcast has now informed us that we will be charged if we exceed our data cap. We never agreed to have a data cap. We were never told we would have one. We just randomly got a warning. Because of Comcast's monopoly on high-speed (non DSL) internet in my area I have no choice but to be subject to their anti-consumer, anti-innovation, and anti-trust-violating business practices.
 Throughout my tenure as their customer I have been subjected to random billing changes, unreliable service, erroneous charges, and many other inconveniences I should not have to endure as a consumer who is paying for a service.
 Additionally, every issue that has arisen with my account has been the sole responsibility of Comcast. Every interaction I've had with them has been combative and very anti-consumer. Their customer service reps regularly hang up on my when calling in for help, lie about the quality of the services, and sometimes go as far as to send me to retail locations for equipment swaps that are either unnecessary or impossible to do based on local store policies.
 If I could choose another company to spend my money with, I would. However the lack of consumer protections from the FCC in regards to predatory business practices by ISPs has allowed Comcast to operate above the law and with no accountability whatsoever. Data Caps are just another example of an ISP using their monopolistic powers to force consumers to pay more for the same service without increasing the quality of said service and showing no economical reasons for these changes.

1062,"I went in to the Comcast/Xfinity customer service center on Asheville Hwy. in Knoxville, TN at approximately between 2:00p.m. and 3:00p.m. today, June 12, 2015 to have them prorate my bill for the 3 out of 8 weeks that I did not have internet or cable television. Micah was the customer service representative that I had to dea with. He refused to prorate my bill, even though he could see that there were 3 weeks that I did not have service at my home for that time frame. I ended up asking for a manger or supervisor at least a dozen times during my encounter with him. Each time he eluded to getting a supervisor for me to speak with. He said that there were not any supervisors in the building, including for the call center located inside. He said that I could call in to speak with the IT department to see if they could help. (From experience they only help if you are currently having service issues, and you have to get transferred to the billing department for billing discreprencies). Micah also said that I could come back tomorrow to speak to a manager. He offered to give me a credit and I told him that I did not want a credit I wanted my bill prorated so I am not paying for services that I did not recieve. I again asked for a supervisor, and he continued on that there were not any in the building. He tried to get rid of me several times by saying, ""I'm glad I could help you today."" I was appauled because he did not help me at all! He even tried to get the next person in line for assistance to come to his window by saying, ""Sir, can I help you."" I did not budge and demanded for assistance or a supervisor. He continued to suggest that I call in or come back another day or even go to another window for help. He even agreed that I should not be charged for services I did not recieve, but refused to prorate my bill. I even said that it was okay to give me the credit he said he could put on my account earlier if that is how he had to do it. He said, I'm sorry I cannot do that. We continued on back and forth until a woman who was helping someone else came over to assist. She said the only way they could ""prorate"" my bill like I wanted was for them to put in a disconnect order and then reorder the service today. I said that was ridiculous. She then said well, you can do a manual credit. And they supposedly did a credit for $49.95 or $49.99 so I left. I have had problems in the past with this company, but it is usually with someone from their company over the phone. For example, last year one person with tech support, tried to upgrade my services instead of fixing the problem. They said that On Demand was not included in my package (even though it was) and that she would have to upgrade my service to get my On Demand working again.

1064,"Comcast has almost a complete monopoly in the Knoxville TN area and places a data cap of 300GB per month on a high speed internet account. After 300GB I and others are charged $10 per 50GB of data. It is VERY easy to exceed that data cap in just a few days by watching Netflix or even Comcast's own On Demand online. This leads to an excessive bill that can be anywhere from $10 to hundreds of dollars per month.

1065,"As both a customer and former employee of Comcast, I am filing a complaint for a few reasons.
 First, Comcast advertises itself as being fast internet, despite still using terminology like ""UP TO X mbps"". However, the internet has been changing and more and more people at getting their entertainment online. In response to that, Comcast went from unmetered internet access to metered to setting up a cap in many markets of 300GB per billing cycle. Because of that access cap, we can now actually calculate how much access we're paying for based on the speed we're sold and our cap. 300 gigabytes divided by 25 megabits per second equals 1600 minutes. That is slightly more than one day of service, or half a day of service if you have been paying more for the 50mbps service (less time for more money!). Now, I completely agree that someone blowing through their entire cap in a single day is pretty ridiculous, but we're coming to an age where we can get pretty close to that. As an example, I bought a new laptop, that meant connecting to the internet, doing Windows updates, downloading all my most used software, redownloading all my music from Google Music, installing Steam and reinstalling all my games, etc. Once I was done, I found that I used nearly half my cap just setting up a single laptop. Imagine if I had teenagers on Christmas and the whole family got new computers? It'd be a nightmare. Comcast advertises and sells customers speed and even promise no worries about connection issues when everyone in the family is online, but they only bring up the cap when you ask them about the bandwidth limit; thus customers think they're getting something they absolutely are not. The simplest resolution to this would be that Comcast can offer different speeds of Internet service, but with no cap, like they used to; OR Comcast can sell tiered bandwidth caps and provision speed based on the number of devices the customer wants to connect; BUT ONE OR THE OTHER.
 Secondly, Comcast double-dips by offering HBO with HBO-GO but counted bandwidth from HBO against your cap, charging you once for the service and charging again if you go over your cap using that service. For any service sold by Comcast, bandwidth from those services should not be counted against your total usage; it's just plain crooked.

1067,"I am very upset that I am still subject to monthly data caps with my Comcast ""high speed"" internet service which I receive at my house. I frequently do remote work for scientific research at my house which requires transferring of large data files with colleagues. I have to pay close attention to my TOTAL bandwidth usage of the month to continue working without being to additional fees.
 Redefining bandwidth or increasing speeds does not help. To not be subject to Comcast's 300GB monthly data limit my only option is to apply for business bandwidth. However that is very expensive and requires signing a two year contract with a very expensive termination clause. This is not a solution.
 Increasing internet speeds is very useless when an ISP (which has a monopoly where I live in Knoxville, TN) can impose very low data caps and charge very expensive fees for additional data. I have no option for alternative internet where I live, and for the majority of this town.
 Please prohibit such low data caps, they stifle the ability of many people to effectively use their ""high speed"" internet service.

1069,"Comcast has decided to start imposing 300GB monthly usage data caps on Internet service in a few select markets. At my address, there is no other option for Internet besides AT&T DSL, which is very slow. I go over the cap every month because I have a family and we enjoy the standard Internet offerings: Netflix, streaming music, etc. it's not like I'm hosting anything here or a using the service.
 I'm very sure that Comcast has only selected markets to do this in where they know that high speed internet options are limited. I noticed that all major cities in TN are listed except for Chattanooga. Seems obvious that they didn't want to do this in Chattanooga because several high speed internet options exist. Quite simply, they are doing this to people in places that have very limited options.
 The overage charge is $10 per 50GB. At this rate, I'm getting between $40-$50 in overage charges each month. Comcast lets you go over without charging for three months, but after that, the charge is added to the monthly bill.

In the last couple years, however, our monthly rate has more than doubled, and now we are being charged ven more for using ""too much data."" This limit did not exist when we first signed up for Comcast. They forced this new rule without consulting their customers, and I have literally no other options for the service I need.

I and my roommates (all early-20s) will obviously use more bandwidth and an 80-year widow, for instance, but we cannot get a plan that provides that, only the low limit with exorbitant overage charges past that point.

Even the months where I am diligent about tracking my usage, I am still somehow showing that I have used 2 GB over my 300 GB data cap. When calling to complain about the service, their representatives simply put me on a faster internet plan, which only makes the issue worse. I am a high school teacher who also has a second job working from home and feel as if I cannot even use my internet services for work-related purposes for fear of incurring additional charges that I cannot afford. I live in an apartment, so I have no choice about what company that provides my internet service. I feel as if I am being taken advantage of, especially when I also find out that my internet can also serve as a hotspot for other comcast users in my area. Super uncool and this needs to change.

1075,"Comcast has a hard limit of 300GB per billing cycle, after which it charges $10/50GB. In a household with multiple devices and using comcast for such streaming as netflix or working with large files that need to be synced to the cloud, this low limit is difficult not to hit. This forced limit causes exorbitant price increases, at times more than double what they ostensibly charge, and greatly limit the ability to use the internet freely, especially with no real competition to switch to.

1077,"Comcast is using unfair billing tactics to inflate internet cost in my area. They are the only provider at my home that provides speeds of 50 Mbps or higher. I was originally forced into a package of Phone Internet and TV although I only wanted internet. They told me if I got internet alone I would pay just as much as I would for all three services. Overtime my bill has risen to 140 a month. I have called Comcast on multiple occasions to try to decrease my bill and remove additional services while being able to keep a fair price for internet.
 They have told me I can remove other items from my account but that my bill would actually increase in cost. I looked at cancelling but was unable to find a comparable service in my area. I need speeds of greater than 50 Mbps for work. Thus they are forcing me to keep products and services I do not require or want. They also randomly started imposing a cap of 300gb per month. Which when you work from home and stream most of your video through Netflix and similar services it is extremely easy to hit 300gb. It's not fair that when I originally signed up for Comcast there were no caps on data, and all of a sudden they have imposed these caps.

 Comcast called me today at roughly 2:14pm Eeastern Time. The number showed up on my phone as 8969, and the lady who called immediately asked me for the last 4 of my social to verify my information. I could barely hear what she was saying due to poor audio on her end. I did advise her I did not feel comfortable providing her that information was the number that showed up on my phone was not an actual phone number. She then asked if we could talk via email and I gave her my email which she then said was good enough information to use to verify my account. I'm not sure why she doesn't just ask for email in the first place.
 Once I spoke with her she advised me that everything that I stated in my complaint was accurate. That if I removed services I would be paying more than I am now for my service. I advised her I have been a customer since 2006 and that my services have gone up over 150% during that time. She said that I had not been a customer that long, that I had only been a customer since 2013. Which is the date I moved into my current home, but I have been a customer at every other address I have lived at in this city since 2006.
 Overall she told me there is nothing that she can do to help and that Comcast would bill me at their current normal rates if I were to remove my phone which would leave me with internet and cable TV at a higher rate than I am paying now. We also spoke of the internet cap and I advised her that the 300gb limit was not fair as I have a home security system that sends video to the cloud for recording and it uses a lot of data and I am going over my limit each month with no option to have a higher limit. She said ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". At that point she made it clear they do not value my business, nor are they willing to work with me. However I have no other options in the city that I am in. No one offers comparable services, and I am stuck with this company who treats it's customers so poorly.
 I also asked if she was going to be replying by mail as that is what the FCC email stated, and she told me Comcast calls of their complaints from the FCC they don't mail anything.

1078,"Consumer has contacted Comcast regarding their e-mail account, which was part of their triple play bundle, when they had when they lived in Shippensburg, PA. (That previous address: Shippensburg, PA 17257) The consumer was not able to transfer their Comcast service to their new residence in Kunkletown, PA - Comcast does not provide service there. The consumer's family moved 1 -2 years ago. When the consumer returned the equipment to Comcast, there was no mention of the e-mail account and what would happen to the contents of that account. The family has been busy with taking care of aging family members and their own health concerns, and wanted to touch base with Comcast regarding this issue now. Today, 6/26/15, the consumer attempted to access his Comcast e-mail account, but was unable to do so. He was given the message that he was not authorized to get into the account. He called Comcast to ask about this message. The representative to whom he spoke was not understanding his issue - she was giving him the name of the person on the account for the address in Shippensburg, PA - it was a difficult conversation. The consumer has requested, since he cannot get into his Comcast e-mail account, that Comcast transfer the e-mail that has been in his Comcast account to his Yahoo account ( that was set up in his new location. The Comcast rep stated that they cannot do that type of action. The consumer is requesting further review from Comcast on this issue. Thank you. (phone - CAMS 29)

I have 2 roku's, 2 laptops, 2 tablets, a cellphone, and one desktop pc which all are using the internet in the same household. Within 20 days in a month I get a pop up from comcast telling me that I've only got 30gb left of 300gb from my data plan which only frustrates me more. In a world where most things are revolved around the internet these days, I don't feel it's adequate to have this data cap in place at all.

1081,"Recently purchased a modem that is listed on Comcast's compatible devices. Since then my internet connection speed is significantly lower than advertised, I get constant signal degradation and have to call to get a ""refresh"" signal sent at least once a week. When I called 6/6/2015 to speak with a representative I asked if this is because I purchased my own device and explained I had no issues when I had a leased device. I was told ""Well, if it was working when you leased the device, maybe you should switch back.""
 I'm very upset about this. I feel that they should not throttle my internet because I'm not paying to lease a device that gives them a competitive advantage in the market.
 Leased Comcast/Xfinity modems offer Wifi to Comcast customers through a second network. Any customer who logs in using their comcast credentials can use the modem that I am leasing to connect to Comcast's network, and at times, the connection speed is faster through this. It should not be legal to charge $10 a month when I'm giving them (inadvertently) a free wifi hotspot for any of their customers to use, and surely if a device is listed as ""compatible"" I should expect to get the same level of service and functionality using it, as one of their own devices.

1082,"I am writing to express my complete and utter dissatisfaction with Comcast, their Customer service department, and Billing Department. Comcast, a monopoly in my area,
 I currently have Comcast as my internet service provider (ISP) as there is no other choice in my area. Unfortunately, local or community ISPs have been in the planning stages for years and have not yet come to fruition. As a result, Comcast is a monopoly and they use their position to practice unjust and unreasonable pricing. Under the Federal Communication Commission, specifically Title II of the Communications Act, ISPs are classified as telecommunications services and they are prohibited by law from practice unjust and unreasonable pricing.
 I would have like to use Comcast only as ISP. I’m currently on a ‘promotion’ that is $44.99 / month for 25mb/s internet and basic cable. Taxes, fees, and additional charges add another $5 to the bill. Comcast refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. If I wanted internet only, I would have to pay $69.95.
 I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. On the roof of my house, I have an UHF / VHF antenna that is able to receive full HD television. The basic cable that I have is not in HD. The cable box that Comcast provided to decrypt their cable signal sits unplugged in the box it arrived in. I do not understand to logic behind that.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I find myself extremely frustrated whenever I have to call or interact with Comcast. Comcast’s labyrinthine phone system is and talking to a person in the United States who can provide more than a summary of my account charges is tedious. It takes me almost 15 minutes to talk with someone that can answer my questions about new charges on my account.
 On June 23, 2015, I found that my ‘promotion’ had ended and I was charged $69.95 for basic cable and 25 mb/s. I called to determine why my bill went up by 50% from the previous month and I tried to figure out what I could do to ‘lower’ the bill to the other amount. I was told that since the promotion I was on was over, I could apply for a new one. Since I never watch TV, I asked about internet alone. I was again told that the price would be $69.95. I told Comcast no thanks and I would like to close my
 account. The representative said I could have a ‘new promotion’ for basic cable and 25 mb/s internet for $54.95. This is the same service that I had before but with a $10 / month increase. I told the representative that I didn’t want that ‘new promotion’ and I would file a complaint with the FCC and FTC. The representative then said that Comcast had the ‘everyday internet price’ of $39.95 for 15 mb/s. I told her that I would take that instead of closing my account. I verified several times with her that the price was $39.95 for 15 mb/s internet. There was no language barrier as she said that she was from the United States. I was suppose to get an email confirmation about these changes but never did.
 The next day, June 24, 2015, I noticed that several website, and email messages were loading slowly. I conducted an internet speed test with several different servers from www.speedtest.net and found that my internet speed with 3.5 mb/s. I called Comcast technical support and they suggest that I should upgrade my modem as the modem I currently own is older and not supported by their network. Comcast offered to rent me a modem for $4 / month. I said no because I’m trying to save money, not spend more. I asked to speak to some in Billing or Customer support. The call took 22:50 and I was disconnected before I could speak to either of those departments. I called Comcast again and spoke with their Billing Department.
 Apparently, there is no internet speed of 15 mb/s for $39.95. It is 3 mb/s for $39.95. They have 15 mb/s internet $69.95. I was lied to by the Comcast representative on June 23, 2015. I was beyond furious. This representative said that I could have a ‘new promotion’ for basic cable and 25 mb/s internet for $54.95. I reluctantly took it as I require high speed internet for personal projects. I asked to speak with a supervisor about the matter about being completely lied to the previous said. After being on hold for a few minutes, the representative said that the supervisor was busy and would call me back shortly. The call-back never came. The reference number for the call is 029884222
 On June 25, 2015, I called Comcast because they advertised a ‘new promotion’ on their website for basic cable and 25 mb/s internet for $39.95. I wanted that rate but Comcast said no as that rate is for ‘new customers’ only. Since I’ve been a Comcast customer and paid on bill on time for the past 2 years, I cannot get the lower rate. I offered to cancel my service and sign up again the next day. Comcast said no and any attempt using a roommate or another family member is fraud and will be dealt with according. How can trying to saving money, in a monopolistic situation be fraud?
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

1088,"I am Superintendent of the Dieringer School District. Out supportive community recognizes the importance of student access to technology and the integral nature of internet access for their education and, ultimately, their future. To this end, the community has funded 1:1 computing for our students. This has led to wonderful innovations that require students to have access to high speed internet at home. Unfortunately, internet providers are not regulated. This has allowed large companies (CenturyLink and Comcast) to take over much of the district, drive out smaller providers, and then refuse to provide service to neighborhoods that were previously served by the smaller providers. in some cases, they have left one side of the fence or one end of a street without service while providing it to other. Comcast says they will not provide service to these areas; CenturyLink says they have no plans to do so at this time. This is resulting in educational inequity for some of our students that cannot be resolved by subsidy. We cannot educate students for their future without internet access.

 Thank you for checking back. Unfortunately, we have been unable to make any progress in our effort to make internet service available to the students of our school district. As we have stated previously, our community has made a huge investment in our children’s futures by providing 1:1 computing for students 3 grade and up, high quality Cloud-based curriculum and a web-based learning management system that allows students to receive and turn in assignments, as well as collaborate with classmates online.
 When Comcast and Century Link made a big push to gain the market share, ClearWire, which had previously been an option in our community, was driven out leaving some children without access to internet. The lack of access to high speed internet denies these children access to our educational program. Interestingly, yesterday there was major news about efforts and the critical need to provide internet access to low income student in order for them to have access to the same educational opportunities that their peers with internet have. The missing part of the story is the ability of large companies, like CenturyLink and Comcast, to refuse to provide access to families on the same street and across the fence from those who have this critical access.
 We have contacted the Washington State Utility Commission, the Washington Attorney General, Senator Patty Murray and your agency. The net result, to-date, is letters from Comcast indicating they have no intention of proving services and that they have told these families that to do so, the families would have to pay up to $50,000 to extend cable down the street when the families at the end of the street and across the fence did not pay for the access to their homes.
 If companies will not be responsible, and no agency has the ability to develop plans for internet coverage, then the system is lacking an important piece of oversight. Please advise us as to any next steps in our effort to provide equity of access to all our students and not leave unserved pockets of children behind.
 Regards,
 Superintendent, Dieringer School District

1089,"Consumer lives in a senior citizen place that pays for her cable. Comcast turned her services off. She is also supposed to be getting internet for $19.99/mo. plus $10.00 for the modem. Comcast was billing her $54.00 month and this month it was $182.00. Comcast sent her a letter explaining the charges. She called Comcast at 800-934-6489 and they switched her to what she though was the billing department. When they switch her they say she may be disconnected. Consumer needs a consistent low cost internet service provider. She would also like someone to communicate with her. She would also like Comcast to honor the rate of $19.99/mo. until February 2016.

1090,"I was charged double for my internet service from Comcast for almost a year. I rarely retrieve my bill
 because they continue to send it to my parents house that I do not live at. When it came too my
 attention I called and was told that a supervisor would call me because of the duration. After 2
 months of calling multiple times a week I never got a call. Finally I was issued a $143 refund which
 was then applied to additional months that I was double charged. Finally got too speak to a
 supervisor and was tons that they can only refund me 3 months because it's my fault for paying them.
 They won't issue my refund and apply it to months that have the correct due amount and they told me
 this is also my fault. I am owed much more then they are willing to give me and I am being told this is
 all my fault."

1092,"In late April or early May of 2015, there was a power outage at my house in Lakewood, Colorado.
 During the outage, I prepared to make a phone call since my phone service with Comcast has always
 worked previously during power outages.
 This time there was no phone service. After the power came back on, I called Comcast and learned
 that while my old modem from Comcast had backup batteries, the new Comcast modem I had
 acquired several months earlier did not. I was not informed of this fact when I exchanged modems at
 the local Comcast store. During the recent phone call to Comcast they did inform me I could buy a
 backup battery for $35 plus shipping.
 This causes me concern since I am not be able to access 911 service which would tell the 911
 operator my name.and location. I feel strongly that 911 service, even during a power outage, should
 be a basic requirement for phone providers, not a customer option via a supplementary battery."
1093,"I have used Comcast at this apartment since I have lived here (May 2014). The service has been confirmed to be poor and cripples my ability to upload files and communicate with my boss, as I produce music for a living and need to upload and download files with ease. Half of the representatives I speak with are eager to help. The other half do not even attempt to do anything. Since I cannot change providers, and the issue persists, it is unfair for me to pay this bill. I cannot spend hours on the phone playing the customer service roulette. This is not the first time I have filed a complaint, and I was compensated through Comcast's executive department over this issue. Without a change in service, this is the most proper recourse."
1094,"I am no longer a Comcast customer because they consistently raised my monthly bill, and refused to lower it when I confronted them. Every month my bill would go up 2-5 dollars and nobody could explain to me why.
 Ultimately I decided to go without cable and internet because I will not be forced to pay outrageous prices because Comcast has a monopoly where I live. I have to live without internet because I am taking a moral stand against one of the worst company's that exist. I might as well live off the grid because of Comcast.

1095,"I have been paying Comcast/Xfinity for internet service. Specifically, I've been paying for 50 MBPS. However, I haven't received anywhere near this speed during the entire time (almost 12 months) that I've been a Comcast/Xfinity customer. I have tested my speed repeatedly throughout my service period and have never seen a speed above 15 MBPS. Recently though, my internet speed has dropped down into the 1-3 MBPS range. I've contacted Comcast/Xfinity three times to fix this issue. Each time, I've been assured the issue is fixed. However, without fail, the issue reappears within a few hours.

1096,"This originally started when I was unable to achieve internet speeds <2.5mbps (as measured by several online speedtests) even though I am paying for 25mbps, which meant Netflix, Amazon, or mlb.tv were all unwatchable. As most Comcast subscribers will tell you, this is typical for ""peak"" times (and they won't do anything to rectify it) so I decided to upgrade to a faster speed.
 After logging into my account at Comcast, I’m greeted with the view shown in Picture A. I select “My Account” and am directed to the page shown in Picture B. After I select “My Services”, I’m directed to the page shown in Picture C. At this point I can select either “See Available Upgrades” or “Upgrade” under ‘XFINITY Internet’, both of which direct me to the page shown in Picture D (notice how at the top of the page it lists “Great new deals for Craig!”).
 I select “See offers for: Internet” and am taken to the view shown in Picture E. Notice that some options list requirements for long term commitments (“per month for 12 months”) or require additional subscriptions (“Requires subscription to Xfinity TV or Voice”). I select the “Internet 105 Mbps” service at $24.99 for 12 months. I proceed to checkout (See Picture F) and after submit my order, am told that I must chat with an agent before my order can be confirmed.
 After online chatting with the agent for a few minutes, I am told that I am unable to select that option, but they would be happy to offer it to me for only $71.99. I am told that regardless of which offer you select (remember under MY account and then MY services and then MY upgrades) you must chat with an agent, at which time they’ll tell you if that price is available or if it is only available at a price 188% higher, in my case. (I eventually repeat the process to find out that the offer was only available to new subscribers, as shown in Picture G.)
 The reason that I am given for this is that they are unable to determine what offers are actually available so they show all options and you must chat with the agent, where they’ll let you know if everything is acceptable. To check, I logged off and revisited their website in “incognito mode”. The offers presented to me were different than those from before, which leads me to believe this is planned bait/switch sales tactics.
 Sorry for the long winded complaint, but I simply want to be able to order internet that is listed as available to me. Additionally it would be great if I could actually count on Comcast to deliver the speed that I am paying for, but I'm not going to hold my breath on that.

1097,"Recently I have been experiencing slowdowns and disconnections to the internet provided by Comcast. My household uses a modem/router, and sometimes the internet goes down for the whole house, requiring a reboot of the router for it to function again. Afterwards it tends to be slow still, and often towards the late afternoon/evening ping and download speeds plummet. This all began happening at the start of the summer as all the college kids came back to stay at the household and started using the internet more often, yet internet will go down and slow down even if only one person is using the internet at a time. This suggests some sort of throttling, as the internet started slowing down or failing after the internet started being used more, but kept on going when only a single person was in use of the internet.

1098,"During the second month of new service with Comcast, my account was double billed. Every item on the normal billed was doubled in the amount that was owed, thereby creating a bill that was twice the normal bill. I called on 3/9/15, and spent almost 2 hours on the phone with various customer service representatives but no one could help. The only response I received was that this was something they had never seen before and it would need to be investigated. I did not receive any return call. I called Comcast again on 3/11/15 and spoke with a representative named Denise (no one has a direct line, so you can't call anyone back) and she said she would take care of it by submitting a report to have the account investigated. She made several notes and was to give me a $9.50 credit for a late fee I was about to incur. The double billing has still not been resolved. I have called an additional 4 times, spent an additional 5 hours on the phone with various Comcast representatives, but cannot get it resolved. Most representatives cannot even find my account. If they can, they cannot pull up the statement in February that shows the double billing. How can a company stay in business with no customer service? How I can be double billed but I have to waste my time and frustration in constantly calling? I don't understand how Comcast is allowed to get away with conducting business in this manner.

1099,"I have internet service with Comcast. I purchased my own modem in August 2013 and informed Comcast that I would not be renting a modem from them. They recorded my modem's serial number and told me the billing would be adjusted. My bill was never adjusted and although I contacted them a second time, the adjustment was not made. I have been receiving e-bills and due to health issues, I didn't realize I was still being billed for the modem. I contacted Comcast about the issue the end of May 2015 and was told by two different people in billing I would be credited for the oversight. It never happened. Finally after calling a third time I was told I would only be credited for 6 months. I asked each of the three people I spoke with to adjust my future bills to remove the modem fee. This has not been done. My upcoming bill still shows a modem fee. I have spoken with 3 people in the last 2 weeks and 2 people initially in 2013 and I have been unsuccessful in getting my bill corrected.

1101,"I have been in contact with Comcast for approximately 5.5 hours in regards to a speed issue. My reported speeds are significantly slower than the advertised speeds for which I am paying. After several agents, and many troubleshooting methods, my internet is still not working properly. Further, this is an ongoing issue. It was not until today that an agent even entertained the idea that my modem may be defective. If the modem itself is defective, that speaks to Comcast's quality department for proper verification of working devices. If it is a service issue, that speaks directly to the company's offerings. I am quite disappointed with this service, and it is exacerbated by the fact that I have no other options at my current location. I do not know how a company is able to monopolize an area, offer low quality service, charge its customers as though the service is fully functional, and still be allowed to thrive as a company legally. I feel as though it is a travesty that this company is constantly in the news for their poor customer service, over inflated rates, and yet nothing is done to admonish their behavior. Also, I find it odd that the only time my internet falls abysmally low is shortly after I begin streaming videos through other companies. I have been given the option to have a technician come to my house, but the last time a technician came to correct an issue from Comcast, I was charged for the service, against the Comcast Customer Guarantee that is outlined on the company's own website. I have grown frustrated with this company's behavior, and I would like to submit a formal complaint. As a side note, I have run several internet speed tests. The speed quoted by Comcast is significantly higher than that of another reputable speed test provider. I find this to be misleading and deceptive in terms of their practices. I am attaching a copy of the findings.

The offer was until 09/21/2013 but I signed up 09/15/2013. In 11/2014 I called to expand my service if I could without losing my plan. The Comcast rep (Terrance) told me that would not take me off the plan. He broke down for me saying my Blast would be $59.99 the expanded cable would be $9.99 and I had to add the NFL Network for $4.99. I was told me to call Monday morning and he gave me a number. I called and Doris told me the info and said my bill would be $81/month. I did have a month I missed which was $42 but I have been paying $90.50 to catch up on that since 12/2014 and that $42 was paid off. My bills have never been correct instead of $81 the bill has been $110.80 and fluctuated from there. Comcast put me on an ESPN that I never asked for and have to call each month to have that taken off. Comcast never honor the agreement of $81/month. 1/07/2015 I have an unpaid balance of $37.85 but I’ve been paying extra on my payment to pay off that $40 that I owed but that stopped going down. On 09/07/2014 I had a bill of $206.25 with new charges of $154.32 when that bill should have been $74.99. I have been sending $90.50 but that unpaid amount never goes down. I have asked for a manager call me about this 3 times this month and never received that call. I want to speak to someone higher up to contact me about these issues because the money I’ve spent I feel I have paid these bills in full. I want these billing issues corrected. Also my name is .

 ). This was placed on my credit report (collection agency) in 2015 and was removed
 within two days of submitting a dispute. I also returned a letter to the USPS with the name of Alvin
 Chavis and asked to have it returned because my name is not Alvin Chavis. I was informed that
 service would be interrupted because of this. The employee also said the service would be
 interrupted because of a previous bill under somebody else's name (she asked me if they were
 available and I told her she would need to call them on the number that is listed for that customer). I
 have had problems with the service since placing the order (possibly because I did a self install,
 which I connected all the equipment the right way). When I first ordered service I ordered internet

 Modem / Leased at $10.00 per month were removed. I did not order an In-Home Service Visit. In the
 adjustments for services removed 05/01/15 section Blast! Plus is in the amount of 70.79, the In-Home
 Service Visit is -33.29, and Modem / Leased is 8.33. In the Other Charges & Credits section there is
 a Video Self Install Kit listed in the amount of 29.95 (there was not a video in the shipment),
 Technician Visit is 39.95, Video Self Install Kit is 9.95 and Unreturned Equipment is 220.00. I sent

 was when I received the letter and there was no expiration date on it or any indication that I needed to
 call right away. I was told ""that was offered last week and that is the way this industry is run"" The
 lady named Chianti told me that I could now have that service for 49.99/month or even better I should
 get their T.V. service, phone and alarm system bundled together for the best deal. I said I only
 needed/wanted what was offered in the letter. She said that's not how it works. I called Comcast a

 no longer available.

I was guaranteed the same pricing for my internet and cable bundle. Not only was the modem not self installable as advertised it took 3 service appointments to get connected. I had daily outages over 2 months. Now that I am connected they have raised my bill to above the rate they guaranteed on the phone, above the base rate with my old modem. I have spoken to 7 customer service representatives all claiming to take care of the problem and the final straw was today the representative stating we can't give you that price for your new modem.

 Marvee expressed that the new service is less in cost than what I was already paying and would include the new phone and voice feature. I continually questioned how much was the plan and she insisted that it is less than what I was paying.
 Marvee explained I can try it out for 30 days and if I did not like the service I can revert back to the plan I was already on without incident. I informed as long as the cost is less and I won't lose any of the services and my plan will go back to the way it was. Marvee expressed that the 'repackage' would include phone and voice. I confirmed I will start the trial in this case.
 That next morning (6/7/15) while checking my email, I received the email confirmation with summary of charges and it was way higher that the package I was on. I felt betrayed and mislead. I called Xfinity support and spoke with Roy. I told him to remove this trial/repackage as the cost is way higher that what I was paying. Roy apologized for the Marvee's deception and informed he would inform his supervisor of the incident. Roy informed he needed to place me on hold to discuss the issue with the supervisor to revert back to my current package. Roy's call was disconnected once he placed me on hold.
 I called back and spoke with Jenny and explained myself again. Jenny informed the tech is coming on Monday and also informed me to call back once the tech comes out to resolve the issue in order to receive my credit for service outage and also to check at that time to confirm if my cable and internet package was reverted back to its normal state.
 On 6/10/15 I called back and spoke with Karen in billing and explained my issue again. Karen applied my credit for the outage days but informed me she could not revert my package and I need to speak with someone in the 'Home Security Dept.’ Karen transferred me to Michelle, a customer solutions rep. I explained my issue to Michelle and she informed me I would need to speak with someone in the Retention Dept.
 At this point, I'm tired of being bounced around and being placed on hold. I request to speak with a manager. I am then transferred to a manager named Tyrone. He informs he can't revert my package back and can only take $10 off for the next few months until another promotion becomes available.
 This is not acceptable as the charges are now even with the $10 off more than what I have been paying since the billing changed in March 2015. This is not the promotion I signed up for and now Xfinity is no longer providing the service I agreed to from the beginning. I explained either abide by the contract originally offered or cancel the service. Tyrone explained I would need to pay early termination fee if I cancel the service. I informed I will not pay early termination fee for something I did not agree to. I informed Tyrone to abide by the contract of service and fix the issue the Xfinity rep created in the 1st place or cancel the service all together as Xfinity is no longer abiding by the service agreement of original service. Tyrone then placed me on hold without warning or notice. It has since been over an hour on hold and Tyrone has not returned to the phone call.
 This is not good customer service or prompt resolution to an issue that and Xfinity rep created with misleading information about cheaper pricing in repackaging my plan. This is very unacceptable customer relation practices.
 As I am still on hold waiting for the Manager to return to the call, no issue has been resolved to date on 6/10/15 at 9:33PM EST. My cell phone call to Xfinity is now at 2:38:22 hours and still holding for a resolution. I may just have to hang up and call back tomorrow, but I sure hope this letter gets someone’s attention.

1114,"Summary: Ordered internet for move, Comcast lost account data. Two weeks later, called with
 questions on service and transferred four different people who first couldn't find our account again
 and then asked us to re-activate service. No remediation or explanation. Our internet quality is far
 below what we ordered (1MB download rate according to home test, with a 25MB plan) and any calls
 to customer service are convoluted and do not address our questions.
 One month and a half before we moved out of state to our current address in Maryland, I called
 Comcast to set-up our Xfinity Performance Internet package. I gave my personal information and
 address. I was told that a self-install kit would be at my apartment before the day of my arrival and
 ready to use. When arriving at our new apartment, the kit was not present and calling Comcast, the
 representative said that there was no record of my earlier call and order and it was impossible to set
 up internet earlier than 3 weeks ahead of any move. I resubmitted my personal data and address and
 had to stop my move-in process to rush over to a Comcast location to pick-up equipment that should
 have been present at my apartment already.
 Two weeks later, I called Comcast with a question about our 25MB speed plan going at 1MB
 according to a speed test. The first representative again said that we had no account. We were
 transferred, without any explanation, to another person who again put us on hold for several minutes
 to look for our account. This second representative dropped the call to a third representative, who had
 no idea of our call and I had to explain the situation for a third time in one day and in one call. This
 person first scolded us and then attempted to upsell my account (which was now found again) to add
 a phone service to our internet.
 When we would not add another product, this representative, transferred the call to a fourth
 representative. This fourth representative again did not know the details of our call, and required us to
 re-activate our service which we already had been using for two weeks. All in all, our original question
 was still not addressed in any way. We are still unsure if our account information will be lost a third
 time as the confirmation email I asked for after this incident has still not been emailed to us as we
 requested.
 On top of all of our communication problems, our plan calls for 25MB download and our internet is
 constantly at a 1MB speed, even after repeated calls to customer service."

1116,"I have less than advertised connection speed for over 45 days. I have contacted Comcast over 12 times during this time period. Each time the Comcast rep would spend 15 minutes or more with me and then forwarded me to another person who was supposed to fix it, but was neither briefed about the problem or could fix it. Service outages or degradation in my area were the common excuses. A tech was sent to my home and changed the router, but still no relief. I called customer service again on 18 Jun 2015 and they said they would make up for the inconvenience by providing upgraded service at a reduced price, but when the second tech was sent to my home on Father's Day he was not advised to bring the cable box and router needed for the upgrade. Since then, I have called several times, pawned off to multiple levels, promised returned phone calls, and no one has called or corrected the issue. Bottom Line: Comcast has not lived up to their service guarantee or provided the service we have paid for.

 I noticed upon my initial start-up of the Safari website page titled ""Top Sites"" it shows small pictures of the websites I visit. It has iCloud, apple.com, Yahoo, Bing (?), Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter (?), Linkedin, The Weather Channel (?), Yelp (?) and TripAdvisor (?). I have never used those with the (?) behind them, but the last three listed, i.e., The Weather Channel, Yelp, and TripAdvisor has the Xfinity Ad showing in them! Could this be how they are injecting their Xfinity Ad into my stream?

 Below is the information I supplied in my first complaint using the FCC Consumer Complaint form. I never did receive the confirmation or follow-up email.
 ""My message sent to the FCC on Tuesday, June 2, 2015 at 2:52 pm via their website.""
 ""For three days my computer was the target of unsolicited advertising from Comcast/Xfinity. Every website I accessed turned into a web page advertising Xfinity. When I would close the web pages, I would get automatic pop-ups with the same Xfinity advertising. I called Comcast for help and asked why I was receiving these ads for their Xfinity. The technician said he didn't know why I was getting them and stated that I must have a virus. I advised him I had Antivirus protection installed on my Mac/Apple computer...that it was running and had detected no viruses. To make a long story short, he told me I needed to take my computer somewhere to have it checked. I told him that it was not my computer it was Comcast. I advised him that this was not being done by a rival internet company like AT&T or one of the Dish companies. That the only one with a vested interest in people seeing this Ad was Comcast! He had me clear my cookies & cache on each search engine I use and reboot my computer. After doing this a few times the problem seemed to go away, but a few hours later it was back again. I am not a very technically savvy person, but I know Comcast is responsible for doing this. I did not call them back about the return of the Xfinity Ad I spent the next two days clearing cookies and emptying my cache and only being able to use my computer for a short period of time in-between. before the Ads returned. On the fourth day, the Xfinity Ads did not appear and I knew that I had not done anything to stop them. I called a family member who is more computer literate than I and was told that the Xfinity Advertising was probably coming through my Router or Servers. He said that they were probably injecting a Code into my stream and that was why I was getting the advertising. I don't know what Comcast did or how they did it, but this novice knows they are responsible for my three days of torture and interfering with my being able to use my computer. I also know I could not possibly be the only person receiving this Xfinity advertisement from them. It seems to have been running in conjunction the same advertising campaign they had on all the television channels. I would appreciate someone contacting me about this so I will know that I haven't lost my mind and also take steps to stop them from doing this again. I truly hope they will not retaliate for my reporting this, because our options for internet service in this state and this area is very limited. I'm sorry this is so poorly written, but I am the sole caregiver for my 94 year old mother and my 69 year old mentally challenged stepsister. My time is very limited. Thanking you in advance for your help in this matter. ""

 Thank you for the information. I had a missed call on my contact phone yesterday from someone at Comcast Corporate in reference to my FCC complaint. The number appeared as 53137 with no name... so I did not answer when it came in. I did not receive the missed call until almost 5:00 p.m.
 CST and he left a message saying he would be at that number until 5:00 p.m. and I could contact him at on Saturday. I was unable to make out his name from the voicemail message.
 My mentally challenged sister told me this morning that someone called from Comcast and she didn't talk to them, because they called yesterday and asked to speak to her Daddy. Her Daddy has been dead for the last 5 years. They called on the house phone (land line), which I seldom use. She has the mentality of a 5 year old and it has upset her.
 Meanwhile I was at my computer trying to wrest it from the grip of the Xfinity! I turned my computer on this morning at about 9:30 a.m. at startup my web pages appeared with ""You are not connected to the Internet""and before I could ascertain the reason I was getting this message I immediately started receiving Xfinity pop-ups and all of my previously used webpages had the same Xfinity advertisement on it. My computer was plugged into the wall socket and all of the lights on the modem were lit and steady. This item is supplied by Comcast for my Internet in conjunction with the television box they supply for my cable.
 I spent the next 3 hours clearing and emptying my cache, cookies, and rebooting. It is gone at the moment, but I'm sure it will return again when I least expect it. I did use my cellphone to take a picture of my computer screen with this Xfinity (xfinitywifilogin.com) mess filling up my screen!
 I was not expecting all the phone calls, I was expecting to receive a communication from them via a letter.
 I don't believe I can take this for another 30 days! As I said before, I care for my aged invalid mother, my sister and my first grandchild is getting married tomorrow and I'm afraid I won't be able to participate via internet.
 Thank you again for listening to my tales of woe, I do appreciate it.

1119,"I received a letter from Comcast offering their Xfinity internet service for 19.95/month, I called to inquire about the service and was told that it was download speed of 2.0 Mpbs, which was the same as my DSL service. They told me that I could bundle my existing cable service which cost me $150.40/month with their High speed 105 Mpbs download for $151.98/month with 2 year contract and $161.98 with no contract if I had my own cable modem. When I received my first bill I was shocked to see that I was charged $156.58 for cable and an additional $55.96 for Internet which was a total of $212.53, when I complained to Comcast Customer service, they said that the package was not available in my area and when I insisted on receiving the original package they made me to agree for 24 month agreement with early termination penalty of $450. I would like to receive the price that was quoted to me when I opted for the service $161.78 for Digital Premier and High speed Internet (105 Mbps) with no contract.

 Comcast offered me a package price of $169.99/month, or 183/month for cable TV and Internet package but billed me for cable $156.61 and $55.95 for internet service for a total of $212.56 or difference of $42.57 when I called to complain on June 19th they informed me that all adjustments were made and the new balance was $173.66 and gave me a reference J 13 they also transferred me to another department and they confirmed the the balance was $173.66. I launched a complaint with FCC ticket #351933, I was contacted by Comcast corporate by John Walton and told me that the issue was resolved and that I should call him in case of any issues. My new bill still reflects the old balance and I have called John Walton (770-559-7666) for a week and left him voice mails but he has not responded for one week."

In addition, Comcast is the ONLY broadband option in the area where I live. The alternative is 3Mbps services from AT&T, which your organization stated recently was not broadband service.
 The optimal solution would be to file a Sherman suit against the concept of municpal franchising so that cable companies would be forced to compete. But independent of that, please, please, PLEASE force Comcast to remove these data caps.

1124,"I have had Comcast for 5 years and have never received the speed I have been billed for. A month
 ago their technician told me there were 3 neighbors (including myself) who were plugged into the
 same data, so we would all get slow speed. Comcast has refused to rectify the situation, but
 continues to bill me full price. I have done everything they ask of me, but can't get other service in my
 area. Verizon only offers DSL here, so in a suburb of Houston, I am stuck with Comcast and
 whatever their ""tech support"" can think of today. I am paying for 25 mbps speed. I have attached my
 latest log of what I am actually getting."
1125,"Comcast is my only available choice of broadband cable internet in my area and does not offer a standalone internet option that is less than if it were bundled with cable TV service. I believe that this violates the merger conditions set by the Commission when Comcast merged with NBCU and also artificially inflates cable TV subscription numbers.
 This came up when Comcast began increasing my cable internet price by $10 a month, two months in a row, taking my bill from $58/month to $83/month after fees. This is the same price as Comcast's Double Play bundle for cable and a higher speed internet connection. I should not have to pay the same price for internet as another customer who has two services. When I contacted Comcast they would only offer me a lower price if I would add cable TV service. The agent explicitly told me I would not get a lower price if I did not accept one of their bundles. The agent instead decreased my connection speed, seriously reducing my quality of services utilizing an internet connection which includes calling via wi-fi on my cell phone. This is a necessity to me as I do not get a cell signal on my property nor do I have a land line. The agent informed me that the amount would be credited towards the bill I was complaining about but instead put it on my next billing cycle, causing me a problem with a carry over amount that was late and triggering a late charge. These are unacceptable practices. I should be offered a reasonable rate for an internet-only service, one that falls in line with the price of adding internet to a cable-only service.
 Nor does Comcast offer reasonable bundle pricing; basic cable with 140 channels costs $65.99/month, high-speed internet at 105 Mbps costs $78.95/month, the two together: $84.99/month, surprisingly the same cost as the bundle with only 50 channels! This seems to be designed to force users into a cable TV subscription and is in blatant disregard of the Commission's terms on the Comcast-NBCU merger. Comcast should not be able to pay to ignore the terms imposed on them and I implore the commission to address the issue of Comcast's unreasonable fee scheme.
 If cable TV prices are $49.99 for the 140 channels offered to me as a bundle for less than I was paying for internet alone, then my internet only subscription should be a similar price. That would make bundling the two together net the user a $15 discount, a very reasonable amount. As it is, the bundle offered to me that forces me to have a cable TV subscription nets the user at $50 discount, or the cost of the cable TV subscription. The only conclusion I can draw is that Comcast is giving away cable TV to inflate their subscription numbers.

1126,"I live in New Hampshire. The price of the ""Internet Plus"" package from Comcast on xfinity.com is listed as $44.99/mo (25mbps down, 10 basic channels and HBO Go for 12 months). We tried buying the service online before moving to a new apartment, but for some reason it wasn't completed. So I called them when our box never arrived after 1 week. They set us up over the phone for the SAME package for $49.99. I didn't realize the price increase at the time. So I called them back to try to get the price reduced to the advertised rate. They wouldn't allow the price reduction because I ""went through a middleman on the phone."" That customer service rep wouldn't allow me to cancel my order; ""if you want to cancel your order, you have to do it between 8am to 6pm."" And immediately hung up. I called another service rep and they put a ""ticket"" in to see if I could get the rate reduced. This second rep was not clear about being able to cancel my order or give a discount; she didn't speak fluent English. Not satisfied with that response I went into the local office in Lebanon, NH the following day. The rep at the store confirmed that a ticket had indeed been submitted for a reduced rate, but could not give me a confirmation when or if the rate would be reduced to the advertised price. The store rep could not lower my rate directly either. The store rep did, cancel my order, because the installation box STILL had yet to ship. I was finally then able to use the internet service at my workplace (while on vacation time) and complete an online order for the advertised price of $44.99/mo.
 This seemed like extra hassle was added to prevent me from going through with trying to get the advertised rate

1127,"It seems every month, Comcast is adding or changing it's billing rates? I've talked to them about the ""sports fee"" (paraphrased)...it is only a $1. but I don't watch any sports, I was told they would remove it, they did not. They have a monopoly in my area which, I thought, by law was illegal. I cannot get any other cable TV/Internet/Phone company.....Generally, it is virtually impossible to get through to a customer representative..and when you finally do they tell you they must transfer your call and disconnect the call instead. there is no where to turn, you can't switch providers.

1141,"I filed a complaint under request# 344358 regarding Comcast's billing me for phone services that were not received. However, since I am receiving ""bundled services"" from Comcast this same issues also apply to my Internet services. Since I am not certain whether both issues will be addressed in my previous request regarding the billing for non-existent phone services, I am also filing a complaint regarding Comcast's failure to properly give me credit for internet services which were likewise not received.
 In May of 2014, I changed my services with Comcast to ""Xfinity Bundled Services which included TV, home (wired) phone and internet. However, despite several complaints/service calls, I had no phone service until 8/24/14 (after yet another service call for which I was also billed) and in order to go online I had to unplug the TV from the modem and could not watch TV. It was either Internet or TV and no phone services at all.
 Since then I have tried to get credit for not having phone and Internet service from Comcast from 5/2014 through 8/24/14 but to no avail. After spending countless hours on numerous days waiting to speak with numerous customer service representative I was transferred from one agent to another and at one point even accused of fabricating stories. Finally, on 12/2/14 I was advised by one representative that I absolutely should receive credit for the months I had no phone or internet service unless I unplugged the TV. She did in fact apply a credit of $33.57 and advised that since the problem continued over a long period of time I should receive additional credit which would be issued by the ""review"" department and I should receive additional credit and a call from that department within 72 hours. I never received a call or additional credit but instead, the credit applied on 12/2/14 had been added back into my bill on 12/8/14. No explanation, no call or anything as to why that amount was added back into my bill. Further, when I made a payment by phone (unable to pay online), I was charged a fee of $5.99 which had been paid and properly credited on 12/9/14. That payment was then ""reversed"" and added to my bill again without any explanation. On 12/13/14, I spoke to a ""Mary"" (confirmation# CR418200120) who again advised that I was eligible to receive credit for the months without service and I would get additional credit by 12/15/14. Again, no credit, no calls, no explanation and I am still waiting for my credit. Subsequent telephone calls had the identical result: one person telling me ""my story did not match their records"" (to which I took great offense) and another one telling me I was eligible for a credit.
 In addition, Comcast has recently developed a new strategy to get even more money from customers by sending shut-off notices for non-payment to customers which arrive the day after the shut-off date and services are already disconnected which then results in a re-connection fee of $15.00. In addition, Comcast's practice of charging one month in advance is likewise absurd, especially when demand for such payment is made before restoring service. I have no problem paying for the services I receive but I should also receive credit when no service was provided. I really need help in getting this matter resolved since it is blatantly clear that Comcast will just continue to give me the run-
 around and refuses to resolve this matter. It should be noted that this complaint is not just for the phone service but also involves the lack of service for internet.

 It should be noted that Comcast AGAIN turned off services without any notices having been received advising of a possible interruption and despite the pending complaints. This is indicative of Comcast's attitude towards its customers who, unfortunately, have no other alternatives for cable services. I am asking again that Comcast be restrained from interrupting services until the issue of credit and its practice of interrupting services before any notices are sent out."
1142,"I have been losing my internet connection repeatedly for the past month and have been calling Comcast to correct the problem for almost two weeks.
 I lost count of how many calls I've made to customer service and then transferred to 2nd level tech support. In addition they have come to my home 3 times and one time when they were scheduled to come they did not show and did not call.
 I work from home a couple days a week and need reliable service. I have also lost a lot of time waiting on hold , waiting for service man to show up or waiting for them while they are at my home.
 It is very frustrating when you call their 800 number about loss of internet connection and have to listen to a message about using the internet to troubleshoot your problem. It is equally frustrating when the automated system asks all kinds of information to verify who your are and then when you actually speak to an agent they verify the information all over again.
 Each person I talked to , who came to my home, did their part to resolve their call assignment, however no one at Comcast takes responsibility to make sure the problem is resolved. I asked to have the name and phone number of a manager who would oversee the problem and ensure it was corrected and was refused this information. How can a company operate where no one is accountable and there is no course of action for a consumer to obtain results. Their only concession is to offer me $20 credit for the down time. This is an insult.

1144,"I have two choices for internet, and one doesn't meet the FCC definition of broadband (""att-notbroadband.jpg"") so it doesn't even count. That means I face a broadband monopoly, in which Comcast refuses (""comcast-monopoly.jpg"") to offer me internet service without ""bundling."" In order to keep my rate last year they forced me to purchase cable TV service. The cable box sits unopened and unused as I have no desire for cable since I don't own a TV. Yet I am required to pay for TV in order to prop up Comcast's advertising revenue--which requires ""cable subscriptions"" to stay artificially inflated through unfair business practices such as this in order to convince advertisers more eyeballs will see their content. Mine see none.
 I would seek service elsewhere, but there are a whopping two providers and the second doesn't even meet the broadband definition.
 I work from home most days, so part of my economic livelihood is literally held up by Comcast. This is not acceptable. I cannot vote with my wallet because no other broadband providers serve my complex, and I cannot sustain an interruption in my service due to using it for work which is why I am filing this complaint before I end up against another year of extortion from Comcast (my term expires in September).
 I want internet. Just plain internet, without being forced to sign up for something that only materially affects Comcast's bottom line (cable), and without being forced to pay non-market, monopoly rates (since there is no competition here).

I was also informed that my internet access would be out for approximately 8 hours. Is there a requirement for Comcast to inform their customers of scheduled maintenance? Do they understand the impact that this can have, especially, on small businesses? I now have to find a location to work from this afternoon.

1148,"In light of the vote by the FCC to protect a free and open internet I would like to file a complaint about Comcast's use of internet usage caps in the Atlanta market. The caps are set at a low level to actively prevent customers from cancelling bundled TV services. While I understand the need to have rules to deter serial bandwidth abusers, I feel that the current caps in the Atlanta market are in place due to a virtual monopoly and as a means to force additional services on consumers provided by Comcast. Internet usage caps prevent consumers from switching to alternative providers for video services and effectively destroy competition in the marketplace. I currently subscribe to their premier internet service and can't understand why I am paying over $100 for service and have the same cap as lower tiers. When I originally signed up for service there was not talk or mention of a data cap. Currently the Atlanta market doesn't have any true broadband competition and I believe that Comcast taking advantage of that by imposing the data caps due to that fact.

1151,"Lightening struck outside my home next to a cable wire that was not properly grounded. I can actually see the orange cord as it was not originally buried deep enough. When lightening struck, the surge came through the cable line and burned out the following: Vizio TV, Denon Receiver, Sony Blu-ray player, comcast x1 box and modem. I called comcast regarding the outage on June 20th and received an appointment for June 26th. Not realizing that all of my services were out at the time of my original call, I had to make a subsequent call on June 21st and explain that ALL of my services were out: Internet, Phone and Cable. I was told that it would be ""escalated"" and someone would come to my home on June 22nd between 2:30 and 10:30pm. I was also told that I would receive a $90 credit for the time that my services were out. The representative ensured me that someone would be out the next day June 22nd between 2:30-10:30pm. Prior to leaving work for the day I called comcast to ensure someone was coming as I left work early to meet the service guys. As the evening progressed I called approximately 3 more times and was ensured all times that someone would show up and I would receive a call. Around 8pm I had not received a call and a service tech had not shown up at my home so I called comcast again and was told that ""dispatch"" closes at 7pm, by law they are not allowed to schedule anyone to service the inside of a customers home after 8pm, a service tech was not coming, ""escalation"" only means that if someone cancels then the person next in the ""escalation"" line gets the appointment. Therefore, I was told that due to the inconvenience I would receive an additional $20 credit and my case would still be ""escalated"". Needless to say I called several more and was told that more than likely I wouldn't see them until Friday, June 26th. A Vizio tech came out on Thursday, June 25th and had to replace the motherboard AND power board. On Friday, June 26th the guys showed up, replaced the ground cable (which is still exposed as the techs won't be out until July 11th to bury it. So if lightening strikes again....same issue!). They informed me that they can tell where the lightening struck which was next to an exposed cable line. They replaced the x1 box and modem and restored my services. However, upon starting up all my equipment (bluray and receiver) none of them worked. They power on none of them receive signals from the TV or cable box. I unplug both and plugged them up utilizing a new HDMI cable and to a different TV that works and nothing, both are burnt out due to comcast's inability to install products properly. I called and requested comcast replace the equipment that was burnt out. I was told that it was an ""act of God"" and therefore, not their fault. However, it was only after I said the ground wire was improperly installed that they initiated a claim ticket. Each time I called, I received nothing but the runaround and poor customer service. I was out of my services for a week, was promised credits that have not shown up on my account and services that are not complete. Now I have to return the faulty box upstairs to a service center in order to have cable upstairs. I have spoken to so many customer service representatives that promised a call from a supervisor (no call or message) and/or promised emergency service. I am very dissatisfied with the level of service or lack thereof I received and lack of resolution to an issue that was obviously not my fault. Additionally, I now have a bill in the amount of $159 (appx) because ""I am billed a month early and I won't see the credit until next month""
 however, when I called today the agent said she did see where a credit is to be issued. I have confirmation numbers for all conversations regarding credits and ""escalations"". Comcast is ripping off customers with their empty promises and lack of service!

 Thank you for your submission. Your complaint provides the FCC with important information we can use to develop policies to protect consumers, remedy violations of the Communications Act, and encourage future compliance with the law.

1152,"The consumer is contunially experiencing and outage with Comcast's internet service. The service
 worked briefly when the technician was out to her home as mentioned in the complaint. The outages
 do affect the telephone as well and prevent her from running her business and contacting her
 constituents. Comcast continues to give her the runaraound. The consumer doesn't think that the
 overseas techs are helping her nor that they are even capable of helping her."
1153,"I have had Comcast Internet for 3 years now and it has been nothing short of a nightmare dealing with this company. When I first started with Comcast, they had to come out to inspect the lines and supposedly install new lines if they needed to. The tech that came out gave us a modem and checked the lines and said they were in pretty bad shape but as long as we were only going to use Internet, it would still be fine. The tech also wrote down and turned in the wrong address (Apt. 1302 that I didn't find out about till later). After a month of Internet connection dropping and horrible speeds, Comcast decided to send another tech out. This tech said that the lines were in such bad shape but refused to install new lines saying they weren't allowed even with written permission from my property manager. Third times a charm because I kept complaining and they send another tech. This tech ran a line from the box outside to the living room window. Even though this line wasn't buried and just laying on the ground to get rained and snowed on, I accepted this because he got the internet to work. Some months went by and everything seemed to work fine though I had started to notice the address was wrong and tried several times to correct it which proved a huge deal because not one customer agent could do this for me citing that they would have to close the account and start a new one. I finally agreed to this after being assured that no problems would occur and since my bill was current. They started a new account and closed the old one with the wrong apartment number but doing so I lost the pricing I was on. Comcast then took me off my promotional package and prices started to rise sharply. I was paying $35-$40 a month and when to $55. They said they could lower my price if I bundled with tv. I tried to explain to them that my one line wouldn't allow that to happen even if I did want tv from them. They said they couldn't help me with the price if I didn't bundle. So I bundled the internet and Tv into one package even though I cannot get the TV service. Now prices have started to rise again to $73. They once again say nothing they can do as I express that I can't and don't want the TV package. To top it all off, I checked my credit score and there is an account from Comcast that says there is a balance which is affecting my score. Of course no one from Comcast can tell me anything about it since they keep saying there isn't a balance. Is there nothing that can be done about a company that cares so little about its customers? I truly have never felt so helpless to a company before and wish I could take my services somewhere else yet Comcast is the only provider that isn't through the phone line in my area and they know it.

1154,"My comcast internet is constantly dropping access for up to 15 minutes at a time, and power cycling the modem no longer solves the issue. I have called Comcast about this problem multiple times, but they act like they have no idea what is going on. It seem seems impossible to even get a technician out here because they either don't show up at all, or they move my appointment without telling me. I'm honestly considering switching back to AT&T. It would mean slower speeds but at least I could rely on the connection.

1155,"At the end of my year contract with Comcast, my bill went up without notice. When I called to downgrade our cable package to a promotional offer I'd seen via email, it took more than 10 phones calls, 3 trips to Comcast and a service technician to come out over the course of 3 weeks to get everything sorted out. During that time, my bill went up and down, despite being very clear with each customer service rep about wanting the same package deal from the first phone call I made (at the end of May). Now I have a cable box that has crappy picture quality (despite my very nice 60 inch HD tv) and the few channels I still have (HBO, Showtime, Cinemax) don't come in 60% of the time. I get error messages at worst and a very pixelated, glitched out picture at best. This was never a problem when I was paying almost $150 a month and had the X1 box. Furthermore, I noticed during the process of trying to work out my bundle (because they won't give you a deal unless you get mean and threaten to cancel), one rep's version of the package was $15 cheaper than another's despite there being no difference in the services. I now have proof that their pricing is arbitrary and the reps just make stuff up as they go. Very disappointed with my service (internet speeds not at all what they claim to be, cable is almost entirely useless due to bad picture/signal quality) but lack viable alternatives in price range and offerings. Not to mention that now, a month later, my bill is still incorrect. I was charged $140 for the month of June but was assured that that amount would be prorated (as I had changed my account before the end of May) and that I'd be covered through August 1. Now I'm seeing that I'm being billed for July. WTF.

1156,"I've had broadband internet since the 90s. I was one of the very first professional gamers to ever get paid to play and to travel. Since then, my field has been constantly held back, strangled and corrupted by the simple fact that ISP's in the U.S. have failed to upgrade & maintain their infrastructure as they have so vehemently demanded money from us for. Countries like Korea, China, and all of Europe are light years ahead of the U.S. with regards to telecommunications, and even e-sports - a massive economy that can only help the U.S. and will undoubtedly become an olympic sport one day - is being held back by greedy executives at companies like Comcast, Time Warner, Insight Cable, etc. are spending money on building their profit-churning machines instead of actually upgrading our infrastructure as promised.

1158,"I am a customer of comcast for my TV and Internet. In early March I was experiencing problems with my internet. After multiple (some failed) attempts to get someone to come out here and address the issue, someone came out and found that wires outside of the house were to blame for the problem. The guy fixed the problem then went on his way. I just went to go pay my bill today (online) and noticed that it was higher than usual. I checked the charges and to my surprise there was a charge of $40 ""customerproblemcall"". So I just called customer service and they exlplained that if the problem isn't something to do with the boxes then I am supposed to pay for having someone come out and fix the problem. At NO point was I notified that I would have to pay to have someone come fix my service. Even when the guy was here he never said anything to me about charging me! Someone could have told me this before SNEAKING it on to my bill. The lady that I spoke with on customer service was extremely rude at the end when I said that if she couldn't take care of it I would file a complaint and hung up on me. This is no way to treat customers and I am overall extremely dissapointed. I do not feel I should have to pay for something that I knew absolutely nothing about. The customer service lady states that I signed something accepting these charges from the guy that came out here. I did not! So if they are going to try and say that I did then I would like to see the proof. Comcast seems to be taking advantage of these opportunities to sneak charges onto people's bill hoping they will pay. It is wrong and I do not intend to pay this $40 charge. If I cannot talk to their customer service I am hoping to talk with someone who can help me fix all of this.

1159,"Customer service made a deal if we paid our bill we would have service restored. A tech had come to fix cable issue on there end. They said we would not be charged. The following bill we were charged $70 for there cable box. That wasn't working. So we paid the balance in person, minus the $70. customer service said they would take off. Looking at passed bills, that $70 was never credited off our bill. So service has been shut off due to their error, their equipment. Comcast says we had to pay for the tech to come fix their cable box. Then they would credit our account for the next month. So why would I have to pay for their mistake, just, so they can give me the money right back to me. It doesn't make sense. Even there bills show something is wrong. First it was on for a couple days, when they saw the error, then they shut it off again. So we have paid 2 reconnection fees since this error.It s been about a month with no cable or Internet, so I shouldn't have to pay for this month either. So at beginning of the month they said we owed $15.35 for month of feb. Then the bill went to $166.00 to now $268.00 within one week.

1161,"i called comcast at 7 a.m on 4-1-15 and spoke to meagan who transferred me customer service and customer service hung up on me. i immediately called back and spoke to billing and the lady informed me that i had a past due balance of 235.33 before my services could be restored, i asked for a 2 week post dated payment on the past due amount until 4-15-15 and was told because my service was disconnected i couldnt get one, i explained to her that was wrong as comcast has done it previously for the past several months and to look back into my history and she would see what i was talking about, she then told me she couldnt do it and when i told her i had the proof from previous bills and my bank statements she got nasty with me, i explained to her that i was disabled because of a work injury since july of 2014, she then proceeded to tell me she didnt care and that it was my fault and put me on hold for several minutes, when she came back i asked to speak to a supervisor and again was denied as she kept putting me on hold again, i have not authorized anybody or anything to make changes to my account and when i questioned her about charges on my bill she again made a rude comment about disabled people wanting everything and we should go away, again i asked for a supervisor and was put on hold and then she hung up on me, i didnt ask to go from making 100 percent of my salary to less than a third of it, and in the past when the post dated payments were made the money was there as promised. i feel violated by this employees remarks as i did not ask to be treated like this at all, i know i am a slow payer but when i say im gonna pay the bill i always did. i would greatly appreciate your help in this matter

1163,"I've been a long time customer of Comcast Xfinity internet service and have recently ran into a number of issues regarding payment plans not being honored by numerous customer service and billing representatives. Most recently, I made a payment on 6/12 and was promised numerous times by both phone reps and online service agents that my service would remain connected through 6/26 and a note was placed on my account stating this. On 6/16 my internet service was disconnected, despite what was previously told to me numerous times the week prior. When I called customer service, I was told that the only way to restore my services was to make an immediate payment and an additional larger payment the following week. Because of what I was guaranteed by phone reps and online service agents the week before, I was not prepared to make such payments on those dates. The current phone rep acknowledged the note on my account but refused to honor it because apparently my account was scheduled to be disconnected on 6/16 – even though no prior Comcast agent alerted me of this and promised that I wouldn’t have services interrupted until 6/26. It makes no sense to me why I wasn’t told of this upon the payment I made the week prior, why a note was placed on my account that any future phone representatives won’t honor, why I was promised of no interruption only to be forced into payment weeks earlier than I was guaranteed. I waited on hold for over an hour and dealt with a rather unfriendly customer service representative. The entire ordeal is incredibly disheartening, frustrating, and forcing me to seriously consider ending my dealings with Comcast/Xfinity Internet.

1164,"I switched from AT&T to comcast for internet only in Oct of 2014 on a promotion that was supposed to be effective for 12 months. The promotion was $24.96/month off of $49.95 regular monthly service which would be $24.99/ month. My bill stopped reflecting the discount in March. I called and the comcast employee said he did see the 12 month discount in the system and I should be receiving the discount until Oct 2015. I called back that afternoon with a separate billing question and that comcast employee told me my promotion was only for 6 months and not 12. She transferred me to the customer loyalty department and the comcast employee told me he was extending the promotion for another 12 months effective June 2014. He event told me not to pay the June bill since the discount applied would cancel out my balance. Two days later I received a package delivered by UPS that contained a cable box, cables, and a remote control. I called Comcast back and they said I signed up for internet and TV even though there was no discussion of this during any phone calls. They said my bill was going to over $70/month and after my discount it would come out to a total of $60/ month. The Comcast employee said they could not honor the deal I had agreed to and would not transfer me to a supervisor. He said the best he could do was offer a $34.99/ month promotion for 12 months. I told him that they need to honor the deal they agreed to two days earlier and I was upset because they were going to charge me for TV as well and I never authorized it. He said they best he could do was give me the offer and if I was transferred to a supervisor he would not give me that deal. I agreed to the $34.99 deal as of now because I have no choice since I need internet service.

1165,"Recently, I contact Comcast to see about lowering my bill as it had recently increased by about 30 dollars. After talking with them, they went over the charges and notified my of a $12 internet speed boost cost. Earlier this year my internet speeds doubled while on the Blast package and I was happy to be getting a better service for the same price. Unbeknownst and unauthorized by me, the bill was increased and this $12 fee was added after my promotion ran off. Comcast did a classic bait and switch without my approval. I am now paying $90 a month for their services because I am forced to keep a cable package to keep the price as low as possible. Without cable in my package (which I NEVER USE) the cost would be over $120 for the level of internet that I currently have. I worked with Comcast last week to lower the bill and wanted to remove the cable, but they told me my bill would be higher without Cable service. This is a joke of a service provider and they should not be increasing the charges without notice and forcing you by price manipulation to have a service you do not want, nor need.

1166,"In Feb. 2015 I signed on with Comcast for their $39.00/month Xfinity Internet for the 1st year.
 Suddenly, my bill has gone up to $51.90. The rep is claiming an internal audit revealed that I have a
 leased modem. Bull! I do not have any additional devices than what was originally shipped for the
 self-install and no tech has been to my home to add/update equipment. Comcast is doing some
 ""creative accounting"" and fraudulent recordkeeping to rob customers!"
1167,"Comast Data Cap....we did not sign up for a limited amount per month, now we are bring threatened
 with overage fees. We are not able to use Netflicks and my husband is unable to use the Internet for
 work as need, etc Please help!!!"
1168,"I live in an area where I can get Comcast for internet or use the DSL from ATT. I am therefore forced to use Comcast because ATT is uncomparable in what the internet can provide to my family of five with 3 students in college online, working from home, video games, netflix, etc.
 My complaint is that I have no choices for service in my area and now I am being given a cap on the amount of data I can use. It was NOT clear to me that I had this cap when I started service with them. I feel that they are deceiving future customers with their advertising methods on purpose! The whole Comcast company does not charge overage on data fees like they do in the Atlanta area. We are the lucky ones that get these charges. I have had charges of $30, $40 and $50 extra per month added on my bill. No that I am a customer, they do call and let me know I am going up to my ""limit"". But, there is not much I can do about that except stop internet use in my house until the next month. I can not even choose to buy more data at a reasonable rate from them. They advertise switching to Comcast so you can run multiple devices and stream videos but, the NEVER mention that there is a limited amount of data or else there are more charges. They also sign you into a contract that you can not get out of for 2 years. Their suggestion was to make my kids play board games. Not really a good answer to being scammed with false advertising. When I sign on to my account with them also and try to cancel some services, there is no where on there for me to do this. It purposely done this way. I can NOT believe the horrible customer service that this company has given me since day one and there is really nothing I can do but keep paying them $250 per month. I can not get ATT Uverse at my address or Charter. I am stuck.

1169,"Over the past year and half, my service with Comcast (xfinity) has been getting worse and worse. My internet service experiences outages and frequently is of poor quality. Calls into the customer service center are even worse. They continually over promise and under deliver on resolutions and fixes. My most recent experience has required 7 phone calls and repeated attempts to confirm a technician visit to fix my internet that has been having issues for a month and is now down a week. I began calling there customer service center on Friday, June 19th and have been promised a technician visit everyday since then. However, as of the writing of this, I still have not had any resolution to my issues. I am usually pretty quiet about these things, but I have run out of patience. Thanks for your time.

The fact that every once in awhile we can get those speeds shows me that they are having congestion issues and are not fulfilling their side of our contract in providing us internet access.
 The Second part of our complaint is that we brought our own modem as well as our own router, and Comcast refused to activate our modem until we installed a tv tuner as well. They charged us $15 dollarss for two self-install kits, in which we did not need. They falsely advertised the package we were given and incorrectly billed us for items we did not use or need.

1175,"First of all, congratulations on finally reclassifying cable companies as common carriers. I can't believe you finally did it.
 I write to you today, because Comcast is throttling my Internet speed to less than 1 Mbps and wants me to pay for a ""Service Protection Plan"" if I want a technician to look into the problem. I'm a very busy man, but they've finally pushed me to the point of fighting back.
 Unfortunately, I signed up with Comcast last October for their ""upgraded"" TV & Internet bundle that was advertised as providing ""up to 50 Mbps"". I remember distinctly picking this package to match the maximum speed of my wireless router. However, from the very first day of service, my Internet speed never reached anywhere near 50 Mbps. The fastest speed I ever reached was 13 Mbps, so I called Comcast to complain about this. Their customer service representative informed me that I was mistaken about my Internet service and that I had only upgraded my TV package. According to the representative, my Internet speed was only supposed to be up to 25 Mbps unless I wanted to pay extra. This made no sense to me, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, my Internet speed seemed to gradually become slower. My family complained, but I told them what Comcast had told me--that our Internet was supposed to be slow.
 Last week, I finally noticed that in January, Comcast had begun billing me (without my authorization) for a mysterious ""Service Protection Plan"". I called to dispute the charge. After going through the usual two rounds of arguing with customer service representatives, I finally got Comcast to remove the charge and credit me for the amounts that I unwittingly paid. However, they warned me that if I ever needed anything to be fixed, I would have to pay at least $75 to have a technician come to my house.
 Coincidentally, my Internet speed dropped to less than 1 Mbps after that phone call. I called Comcast today, and the technical support staff member informed me that my Internet speed should be 25-50 Mbps as I had originally thought. He also sent a signal to my modem to increase my Internet speed. It is now almost 2 Mbps. This is absolutely ridiculous!

The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 70 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

1181,"I am contacting the FCC to complain about comcast/xfinity internet. I pay for their service and it has been completely unusable in a broad sense for months. Me, my brother, and my mom pay for this service to use it for streaming (netflix, videos, youtube, etc) and gaming + other entertainment, but I also developed a small online business where over a thousand people tune in to watch my broadcasts and donate/subscribe to me as payment. This buisiness has been absolutely sabotaged by comcast. With constant crashing, downtimes for 24+ hours, and more, I was FORCED to cancel an UNBEATABLE (price + speed wise) package with comcast simply because my internet didn't work. After numerous calls, 5 total technician visits, and more, they are now demanding I pay a termination fee of 240$ when it is their fault I am leaving an unremarkable and cheap and fast package behind, to switch to verizon where I will be paying 3 times as much for roughly the same speed and NO TELEVISION. But I would rather have availability and functionality than anything. This is why I refuse to pay this 240$ termination fee, as it's preposterous that I pay a fee when comcast forced my hand in this matter. Each technician that came to my house claimed the last technician didn't do their jobs and they had fixed my internet - however - none of them had, and even after I've cancelled the internet and am using it for the remaining days, I am typing this letter while tethered to my phone's internet because MY COMCAST INTERNET IS NOT WORKING. Please respond and tell me if there's any way I can avoid paying this preposterous termination fee.

1185,"My promotional price on internet has just expired. This promotion was $34.99 per month for 12 months. You'd expect maybe about a 50% increase to $50 per month to be something within reason for the ending of a promotional deal, but the bill jumped a ridiculous 125% to $78.95 per month. It's impossible to imagine Comcast was losing money on my account at $35 a month so at best they are marking up my bill 125% in pure profit and at worse even more should my cost to Comcast as a customer be less than $35 (which I'm sure it is MUCH lower).
 Furthermore, a bundled deal with the same internet speed plus starter cable TV with 140 channels is offered to me at $84.99 per month. This is a mere $6 per month more on my bill for 140 cable TV channels that is normally billed at $49.99 per month if purchased alone. Since I'm fairly certain that the cost to Comcast for me to add cable TV is surely more than $6 per month in subscription fees and other costs, there is no way that I'm being offered additional TV services at a loss. This further leads me to believe that the price of my internet is extremely high and inconsistent with the prices of other products and services offered.
 Finally, many companies have the courtesy to inform you that your upcoming bill is changing and your promotional period is ending. Given that many consumers use auto-pay and tend to not worry about checking bills, I'm certain Comcast uses this to their advantage to catch consumers off guard or potentially have a mass of consumers completely unaware that their monthly bill has more than doubled.
 These sorts of shady, inconsistent business and billing practices need to stop. Cable companies such as Comcast use their monopoly on local cable internet and cable TV services to their advantage to squeeze every dollar they can get away with from consumers.

1186,"Comcast has their Data Usage meter rigged in favor of Comcast or they are just unbelievably incompetent. In April and May my usage for data was 112Gb & 53GB. Since they have started the meter usage app my data usage has climbed to more than a half terra byte (514GB) in one month. I’m not even using the computer much since they started this 15 days ago. I’m paying for a service that I can’t even use without fear of them overcharging me.
 I’ve called 6 times to dispute the data usage and I get nowhere except for them to say someone is stealing my internet. I don’t broadcast my network, I have changed all my passwords, I’ve made it so only 5 devices that I know the mac address of can even use my internet, I’ve completely revamped my security on my router & I have no easy passwords.
 I believe this is a lead up to increasing rates for usage which is not correct at this point. I’ve already switched services to a new provider and as long as they don’t rig the usage to be inflated I’m sure I’ll be much more satisfied.
 But someone has to reign Comcast in. They are ripping off the customers.

Thus far I've been scammed for $180.00 by Comcast in the past year. I have made over 11 calls to customer service and have yet to receive any type of answer other than a supervisor needs to review the mis-billings because the credit amount is more than can be authorized by the rep.

1188,"I have had multiple issues with Comcast billing me and not making proper adjustments for work (technician work) that they are not doing however billing me for. One specific issue happened in November 2014. I had four separate work orders with the company to complete a line installation. The first work order, the individual could not complete the work (separate in home line installation). The next three work orders, I stayed off work and Comcast missed three separate appointments yet I was still billed installation charges. And then when I called multiple times to get the account billing correct (I never had the service activated or turned on); I never got any resolution and the account was sent to collectors incorrectly effecting my credit reports :-(. I finally got that issue resolved (May 2015) called back in for service (June 2015) - the service is active, however I am going through the same issue again. This (second instance - happened in June 2015) the technician came to the house, did not complete any technician work - however I am being billed for technical work (line installation) which did not take place. I have spoke to a Tameika on June 10, 2015 who is suppose to have a supervisor called me regarding this issue. I have also talked to multiple individuals on the account regarding this same/these same issues. It is very disappointing being a Comcast Customer with this type of service and continuous billing and technical issues. I wish there were more/additional options in my area to choose from.

1190,"Comcast internet is enforcing a rediculously LOW data cap on customers in several regions. I myself
 am in Huntsville, Al working with the Army. My wife and i dont watch tv, but instead stream everything
 from online. In this area, no one place has multiple providers so we are FORCED to use comcast. the
 300gb a month data limit is incredibly low considering a single tv show streamed at what is now
 considered standard quality can use up more than 3gb. if we go over the data cap, we are charged
 exorbitant amounts for every overage."
1191,"My ISP, Comcast, currently offers bundled services for phone, tv, and internet with lower internet prices than they offer standalone internet service. This is not merely as part of a promotional offer. They offer a punitive pricing schedule for standalone service. I believe this is done to help their stock performance metrics, as it allows them to demonstrate to shareholders an artificially inflated number of subscribers to all their service offerings.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate.

1193,"Despite a multitude of attempts, Comcast Business refuses to take action and terminate my business Internet/phone service contract. I am an attorney & consultant with home-based business Internet. I recently built a new home and asked Comcast to transfer service from the old location to the new (mid-March 2015). In late March, I received a call from Comcast asking me to personally bear the majority of the expense (approx. $5000) of bringing a line to the new construction. Of course I vehemently declined. Since that point in time, I have asked for the contract to be immediately terminated on several occasions while talking to several Comcast representatives, each of which assured me this would be taken care of (I have saved a large volume of emails that will back up this correspondence). Not one of these reps has done a thing, and as a matter of fact, they do not even respond to follow-up emails (also saved). I began asking for email addresses when they wouldn't provide direct phone numbers, as I was never able to speak with the same person twice upon calling the primary line. So it has now literally been three months, and I am STILL receiving monthly Comcast bills for services that I do not have, as well as regular phone calls about the ""interruption of my service"" for non-payment. I am at my wit's end because no matter what my efforts are, this issue obviously won't be resolved until a higher power intervenes. I am more than happy to provide all of my documentation to assist with any efforts by the FCC on my behalf. Please pay important attention to this matter as this company truly believes it can treat the customer however it sees fit with zero repercussions. Thank you.

1194,"Hello,
 I am a Tennessee resident who has been effected by Comcast's Data Cap trails. The Data Cap imposed in my area is 300GB/mo. As a consumer in the digital age, a great deal of my purchases are provided to me via download or streaming service. Like many, my household regularly uses streaming services like Netflix and Amazone Prime. In my home, several devices require internet access and data usage to all sorts of media. Among these are a number of gaming systems whose online access subscriptions come with free games twice a month. Yesterday, I downloaded two of the eight games available this month and have now already used 52GB of the 300GB/mo allotment. Many other games available for digital purchase would require much larger downloads, marking a significant sector of commerce impacted by Data Caps. This is but one example, but the same could be applied to video purchases, software, and the ever increasing need for data transfer in business and our modern world as a whole. Though I pay a monthly cost to receive a consistant 50Mbps, the 300GB/mo usage limit imposed in my area means I can only use 50Mbps for approx. 13.33 hours or average less than 1Mbps over the course of said month. That is, Comcast's Data Cap discourages me from using more than 2% of the service I have purchased with a threat of penalty if I do. Comcast is billing their customers simultaniously under two pay models - double dipping if you will - in a way that discourages free commerce. Furthermore, Data Caps in general are simply incompatible with the broader marketplace of our era, as such a practice will inevitably be ever behind practical usage. I ask for Data Caps be done away with on the grounds that it is harmful to consumers and business alike, so that broadband companies imposing these then be encouraged to develop monetization models that will promote a thriving market.
 Additionally, it is apparent that broadband companies are imposing data caps to keep customers from streaming content as an anti-competitive measure to preserve their antiquated business model, and they are currenty able to do this because local ISPs have no real competition.
 Please read this article for a more detailed analysis of the practice of ISP Data Caps: http://unbreak-it.com/2014/08/data-cap-problem/
 I thank you for your time and consideration and ask that you please protect the consumer and help America thrive in a growing world economy by eliminating the practice of broadband company Data Caps.

1197,"My Internet goes from normal to almost none at all . I got a new modem for Comcast because my Internet was acting up . I thought it was the modem and comcast said it was . They put a modem that made a Hotspot with my modem and never told me . Then I started having problems with my wireless printer and my security cameras. ( my static ip address were coming up invalid in the modem when the hot spot was on) I called comcast and told them to shut the Hotspot off . The first call the said the would shut it off ,and they did . The next day it was back on. I called again and they secured and said they (comcast) would shut it off. That night it was off again. The third day I had the secured hot spot and an open hot spot showing in my available networks I called again and told comcast to shut the hot spot off or the next call would be from a lawyer . The hot spot is off finally . My Internet is supposed to be fast and half the time it is barely there. You are told by comcast the hot spot does not effect your Internet , but it did mine.

 July 1 I had an appointment to look at my internet. They changed out the router and I put in the amp . That night I lost my cable on all my tvs. I called Comcast and got an appointment for 7/8/2015 between 3 and 5 pm so they could check the lines in the street. They never showed up , I even got a call the night before confirming the the appointment. When I called Comcast said I never had an appointment for this day. When I complained that I was supposed to get a credit for a no show. I was told I was not going to get one because I did not have an appointment. I called and lowered my service (which I am not happy about) They are the only one in the area , we are at there mercy, They are building 2 new building in Philly on the backs of people over paying for sub standard service and false advertising about the internet speeds. I did get my $20 credit finally when I reduced my service, but I had to really fight to get it.

 July 13 my wife received a phone call from an executive from Comcast her name was Elaine Singleton the number she gave was 322 731 3715 it is a wrong number. I called the Comcast too see if I can talk to this lady, but I was told there was no executive by that name. Why did they call my wife and why is there no one by that name ? This is just Comcast way to keep the FCC happy by telling them we reached out to them and we did not hear from them. They don't need me to be home because the problem is out on the poles not my wire to the house or the wiring in my house, they have all been checked. What Comcast is doing is saying false statements about their speed . So far it is almost 2 month I am getting about 60% of the speed I am supposed to get . Sounds like false advertising to me.

 I saw a Comcast repair person last Friday with a bucket truck. He replaced a piece on the pole in front of my house. The pole was replaced about 5 years due to a person backing up in to the pole. I was told by the Comcast repair man that this could be the cause of my slow internet. I tested my internet before he replace the wire and it was about 40 mbs after he replaced the piece it was about 55mbs. I am paying for 105 mbs , I do understand I will not get the 105 mbs all the time but I think I should get about the high 80mbs.
 After the repair I was contacted by E. Singleton and was told I need to have another tech to see why I am so slow and change the modem for the third time. I told her the problem is not the modem , it is out side on the pole some where . She asked me the best time to have a tech at the house , and I told her Sat morning. She said she would send someone out between 7am and 10 am on sat July 25.
 Sat July 25 I called Comcast at 10am to find out where the tech was and was told I never had an appointment. Now this is the third time there was a NO SHOW for this problem and it is going on two months now. The last no SHOW I had a ticket number and an appointment but no one could give me a reason what happened. All I got was a $300 credit for my trouble and still one has reached out to me from Comcast as of jULY 28 18:00 . All I want is what the internet fixed, I do not think that is asking for too much."

My boyfriend and I are 25 years old, work full time and struggle each month to fix comcast's continuos errors. Like many others that likely reach no progress with this company, we get stuck paying their outrageous bill. Ours is currently $174.00/month and seemingly getting higher and higher every bill cycle.

1204,"Comcast pricing structure is a mess. I have been paying $49.99 for residential internet. $49.99 is a promotional price. My newest bill came in at $66.95 with a $3.39 service discount netting to $63.56. When I called the only option was for me to sign up for internet and cable for $69.95. That price is good for a year and they I guess it will go up and up and up. The FCC has to force these providers into utility status. Every few month I feel like I am at a street fair in Kabul haggling with a street vendor over the price of a scarf. In my location I have no other wired service options, only wireless. I find the Comcast product acceptable but having to continually negotiate pricing is absurd. I want their best deal all the time. I pay my bill like clockwork, is it too much to ask to get good stable pricing from my internet utility?

1205,"To Whom It May Concern,
 I am a Comcast customer at my wits end. Back around August of 2013 I purchased my own cable modem to reduce charges of a modem rental from Comcast. I purchased a Arris T602 modem online, I purchased to the same exact modem provided by Comcast to ensure compatibility & the modem also has a battery back-up which I liked. I called Comcast gave the MAC address & information & was told to return their own equipment to the return office located at 141 NW 16th St Pompano Beach, FL 33060. As often the line at Comcast is excessive & out of the door. To my fault I kept the modem for around 6 months before actually returning it. I returned it at the same location in Pompano Beach. I dropped the modem in a drop box on the property located next to the front door. The drop box is provided to customers to avoid the line & they collect the equipment at the end of the day and scan them to credit accounts.
 Several months later I noticed being charged for the modem even after I returned it. I will take the charges for keeping it prior due to my desire not to stand in line, however after I returned it I was still being charged. I called Comcast to further investigate & find out why I was still being charged. I informed them I returned the modem, purchased my own. The person on the phone told me I should have waited in line instead of using the convenient drop box they provided. Which made no sense to me at all. I was told that they would open a ticket to determine where the modem is. Many months later I was still being charged for the same modem rental. I kept calling to see if there was a change. I was told they could not find the modem and I was still being charged even though I had returned it because they couldn't verify I actually returned it (as if I stole it apparently). After several calls and many times of being on hold and being disconnected they finally waved my modem charge (partial) around August 2014. I monitored my bills and no longer was receiving the charge.
 In January 2015 I received a notice in the mail from Comcast. The notice stated that during a review of my account it was found I was not being billed for my modem rental. This was the same modem I had returned over a year ago and had my own modem at this point. Afraid to re-explain my problem over the phone yet again I called Comcast to try to clarify & resolve this issue. I was told over the phone again, they couldn't verify if I had returned the modem or not. I explained that I had purchased my own identical modem from a online retailer. I checked my account online and it showed the old modem Comcast owned that I returned on the account still! This was verified as I kept the MAC address of the Comcast owned modem because I knew they were incompetent. The person on the phone explained that there was no way I could purchase the same modem online. She suggested that I had purchased a ""black market"" stolen Arris modem. I assured her and although I couldn't provide details on the purchase I wouldn't buy a stolen modem to add to my account. (I am a police officer, I wouldn't steal the Comcast modem they didn't think I returned and/or buy a stolen modem to
 add to my account seems silly). The woman on the phone said that if I wanted to buy a modem I could (you know ANOTHER modem) to add to the account and until then I would be charged for modem rental (even though it was returned years ago).
 So I broke down & went to Best Buy, in January 2015 I purchased a Arris SURFboard modem. I called Comcast to add it, no problems even though the old Comcast owned modem is STILL on the account.
 Fast forward to today, April 7th 2015. I am reviewing my bill to discover, you guessed it. I am still being charged for modem rental. I called Comcast today and quoted ""Hi, I am calling as I do monthly to have my modem rental charge taken off my account so I am not being charged $10.00"". The woman who was actually local was friendly and took the charge off. I did not bother to explain the whole story as it would not make any sense. I was charged for modem rental in March & April this year so far.
 I can assure you the modem I rented back in 2013 that Comcast thinks I didn't return was actually returned to them. In fact I am almost positive that the modem value now is less than $50.00. Which is more than I have been charge in modem rental fees since I returned it over a year ago.
 I am filling a formal complaint due to the billing problems, lack of customer service & continuous incompetence from Comcast's billing. To this day my account still shows the old Comcast own Arris modem as active equipment on my account.
 Thank you whoever read this long winded description & have a good day.

1207,"On Saturday, April 11, 2015, our cable/phone/internet was cut off when a Comcast service truck was next door working on a neighbor's system. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Comcast service trying to schedule a service call to give us service back. Multiple calls were made and we were told they would call us back within a few hours. Never did. We were cut off several times after being on the line for almost an hour each time. Calling back meant redoing everything from scratch. Finally, an appointment was scheduled for Monday afternoon (April 6) and this was ultimately changed to the morning of April 6th. I have no complaints about the actual service person, who did a great job. But the online chat person and the many people we spoke with were frustrating beyond belief.
 Complaint Two: We learned that our bills have been double-billing for internet service for almost two years at the tune of $55 per month. When we added voice to the package, Comcast did not adjust the billing to take off a internet access we had using another modem. The bill was not clear what was being billed in the bundle portion versus the internet access additional charge, so we were not aware of the double billing. You can't pull bills from more than about a year and one-half on the website, so it may be that we have been double-billed for even longer. I estimate that the double-billing from the point we got voice added in amounts to almost $1,000.00.
 This is apparently a common occurrence, as I have learned. That adds up to a lot of money being incorrectly billed in confusing invoices. I have registered a complaint with Comcast, but they say it's seven business days until I ever hear anything. I have asked for a copy of the report to be sent to me, but haven't gotten it yet.

 I was contacted by customer service after filing the FCC complaint. They would not refund the overbilling except for 6 months' worth. I contested that decision. It turns out that the double billing goes all the way back to 12/2012 and totals $1527.40. Here is a portion of the text from an email that I received:
 As requested, I have outlined the credits that were applied to your account for the double billed internet services dating from 12/11/2012 through 4/6/2015. The total credit that was applied to your account was in the amount of $1,527.40 and you currently have a credit balance of $1,364.31 after your current service charges of $163.09 were deducted from the credited amount. Please see attached statements as supporting documentation.
 · 12/11/2012 – 12/21/2012 = $34.63
 · 12/22/2012 – 8/21/2013 = $51.95x8 months =$415.60
 · 8/22/2013 – 8/21/2014 = $54.95x12 months = $659.40
 · 8/22/2014 – 3/21/2015 = $55.95x7 months = $391.65
 · 3/22/2015 – 4/6/2015 = $26.12
 I had to request copies of those invoices and a breakdown, both requests of which were met with less than a cooperative reply.
 Also, I would like to amend the complaint to include a new charge for onsite services of almost $100 to fix the cessation of our service caused by the Comcast repair person at the neighbor's home. This is too egregious. I have asked that these charges be taken off the bill, which does not even give a date for the service charge. The bills do not contain enough information to be able to figure out what charges are appropriate and what are not."
1208,"Comcast has been 'trialling' a 300GB/month data cap for several years now and I want to file a complaint about it. As more and more services become available over the internet, the 300GB/month data cap is far too low. We are a family of 4 people (2 adults & 2 kids) and it is very easy to exceed this data cap every month from using services like Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime Video for movies, Youtube for videos, and electronic video game distribution from Microsoft. For example a new console game download alone is close to 20% of the monthly 'cap'.
 It is deeply disturbing that they charge an 'overage fee' for exceeding this cap considering that a large component of the data usage (movie & entertainment) is related to services that are in direct competition with Comcast. I believe that their only motivation for the monthly data cap and subsequent 'overage fee' is to stifle competitive services.

1209,"The data cap Comcast is ""trialing"" is out of control. We have high speed internet so we do not have to
 pay ever increasing charges for cable or satellite. We use commercial streaming software such as
 ""Netflix"" and ""Hulu"", which we also pay a monthly fee. This data cap is quickly reach well before the
 end of the billing cycle. We should not have to worry about going over a data cap, when speeds allow
 for the cap to be reached in less than a day. We also work from home, so all of that data counts
 towards this as well."
1210,"Comcast has implemented a hard data cap of 300G per month in my area. The only local competitor
 is AT&T and their footprint is significantly smaller and slower. This cap is set regardless of which
 level of service you have from them. If you are paying more per month for a faster tier of service that
 only serves you to hit your cap earlier. There is no option for an unlimited home plan. Also, there is
 no variable cost to Comcast if I use 100% of my allotted bandwidth for a billing cycle versus 1%.
 There are an increasing number of video and audio streaming services, and downloadable digital
 content such as video games, that causes this arbitrary cap to be reached early into the billing cycle.
 Usage based billing discourages Internet usage and only serves to hurt consumers.
 Comcast is also hijacking my requested data and inserting their own JS in order to warn me about
 reaching my arbitrary cap limitation. The code leaves me open to JS vulnerabilities and is poorly
 written. The offending code can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ryankearney/4146814

1211,"Hello,
 I had just gotten off the phone with a ""customer support"" specialist in reference to an odd pop-up that
 appeared on my computer screen when I was watching a YouTube video. It was mentioning that I
 only had 30GB, of 300GB, left of internet usage for this month. This was odd because I had never
 seen this pop-up appear beforehand.
 I called their ""customer support"" in reference to this issue and found out that not only did they choose
 to inexplicably put a data limit on the account, but proceeded to have not notified anyone in my
 household that this is the case. Supposedly they, from talking with the person on the phone, we had
 this in effect for the past couple of months. Not notifying anyone of this resulted in no one knowing
 this was in effect, and without knowing this, we did not know that we needed to curtail our Netflix,
 YouTube, etc. viewing or risk getting taken to the cleaners in overcharge fees.
 After conversing with the person on the phone, supposedly we had three ""cards"", once we used
 them up, we would get $10 for every GB over the data limit. Due to the lack of communicating this to
 anyone in the household, he decided to drop the ""bomb"" that not only was this going on without
 anyone's knowledge, but we also managed to have used up two of these ""cards"".
 The truth is that we wouldn't even have their ""service"" if they didn't have a monopoly on cable
 providers in my area. So, unless you could do something in reference to the monopoly, at the very
 least we should have all things wiped and start with zero cards used (due to Comcast's negligence
 and inability to notify their customers of any new changes BEFORE they take effect).
 Thank you, and I will wait to hear from someone on this matter,
 Paul.

1212,"On May 17, 2015, I went to Comcast Xfinity website and was on their chat with a sales rep. The sales
 rep offered me a plan that doubled my internet speed, waived one months modem lease fee of $10,
 kept my landline plan the same, and offered an improved TV plan as compared to my existing plan.
 During the chat the sales rep confirmed my acceptance of the plan, and advised that the change had
 been completed. I was supposed to save $39.99 per month compared to my current plan. Towards
 the end of the chat I lost my internet connection, possibly due to a signal that was sent to my modem
 from Comcast, as the modem lights were blinking. That prevented me from accessing a link that the
 sales rep told me to go to in order to confirm the plan change. I could not access that link, and my
 land line also did not work due to the modem failure and internet disconnect. Today I was able to
 access the internet, and I clicking on the link that the chat rep had given me, entered all the required
 information, and a box popped up stating that no contract was found.
 So I called Comcast, talked to three people, including a supervisor. I emailed a copy of the chat text
 to the supervisor to confirm the details of the plan, and that the chat rep and supposedly processed
 the change in plans. After talking to these three people for an hour, I was told I would have to log
 back on to sales chat and go thru the entire process again.
 I logged back on to Comcast web, opened a new chat with a rep. That rep refused to honor the chat
 rep's plan from last night. I asked for and chatted with a supervisor. By now I am on the phone or
 internet with Comcast for over an hour. The supervisor refused to honor the plan, and told me to go to
 the sales page and select a plan. Then I got a message from Comcast that my online connection had
 been terminated due to inactivity, which was a complete lie because I had been chatting for an hour.
 Also, when I logged onto Comcast yesterday, it showed that I owed $168.00 when in fact I only pay
 $146.00 per month. Nobody could explain the discrepancy.
 My new plan should only cost me $106 per month, plus a $10 monthly modem rental fee. Last nights
 rep agreed to waive the fee for one month to give me time to buy me own modem, which has to be
 purchased from a local Comcast store.
 Again, I emailed the chat to the supervisor at Comcast earlier today and she read and confirmed the
 details of the agreement from last night. I also text the chat on the chat page today for the Comcast
 supervisor, so they have the details of the agreed plan in writing.

1213,"I am very unhappy that Comcast is my ONLY option for internet. Over the years they have covered my home in cables and never cleaned up the old cable so when their technicians come out they have no idea what goes where! In addition when they buried a new cable recently they only buried it about an inch or less. The cable was cut over the weekend because it was not properly buried. I can't get anyone out here for 5 days and I work from home and must have internet.
 I want another option for internet this is not acceptable!

1215,"We have owned comcast at home now since November 2014. Our monthly rate is $89.99 for 105mbps service. My family (my wife and I) averages about 320GB's per month which in turn has comcast charge an additional $10 for 50gb past the 300gb limit per month. We are fine with that.
 We got 3 months of ""free overages"" which I kept track of for January, February and March. I monitor my network at home very excessively (I am a network engineer at work) and see that I average 320GB per month which should set our bill to about $99.99 per month for Comcast.
 On the month of May, Comcast debited $260 from our account and did not explain. We have spent countless hours trying to talk to someone for an explanation (over 50 hours of phone time). According to my data, my network did *NOT* exceed 300gb that month. After dozens of calls, Cocmast opened a ""case to determine if the data was coming from my modem"". Two weeks later, I got a call back saying ""we have verified that all data has been coming from your modem and there will be no refund"".
 According to their statistics, we used over 1100GB of data for April. In order to do that, we would need to have had 4 different devices streaming HD content every second of the month. The only things my wife and I do is check email, facebook and play a few games. We have never used that much data in that period of time. In fact, I was out of town for work for TWO weeks that month and there were NO computers at home during those weeks accessing the network.
 As of today (June 8th), Comcast is now charging us $360 for the month of May with no warning or explanation once again. We have called numerous people in regards to this with no answer and debited our accounts anyway.
 As of today, the service is canceled (hopefully) as we do not have the money to continue. Comcast refuses to explain what was downloaded and when. They have only said ""we see the data came from your modem"" and that is it.
 Please help us. We have no internet service in our area and have no choice but to use a dial-up connection moving forward until ATT installs service in our area.

1218,"I have been a Comcast customer for a number of years. I am not a gamer, I stream movies occasionally and I have not added any new internet-ready items in my home. However, in the past few months, I have noticed a substantial increase in the amount of internet usage Comcast is claiming that our house uses. I use my own modem & router & can see, at all times, what is connected to my home network. The network is password protected. I had a maximum of 9 ""clients"" (a TV, a network fax machine, 2 Directv boxes, a wi-Fi extender, 2 iPads, a BluRay player and a desktop computer) connected to the network. The only client connected at all times to the network is the wi-fi extender. the others are turned off periodically. When the internet overage issue first came up in February 2015, I was concerned. According to Comcast, My January 2015 usage increased over 150 GB when compared to the December 2014 usage. This was without adding any new internet clients. Each month has increased gradually since. I changed my internet password to ensure my network was being used externally (although I know it was not). i also removed the TV and the Fax machine from the network (making my current total of clients 7 items). The password change & the removal of 2 clients did not affect the usage at all. In fact, it seemed to increase the usage. I contacted Comcast with my concerns. they informed me that I must be using that much and suggested that I might be using a torrenting program. I asked them why they would think that & they pointed to a supposed warning I was sent in 2010 or 2011 about downloading a torrented movie. I responded that I 1) don't recall any warning and 2) I don't torrent. I will say that this increase in usage started to occur right after I negotiated a lower monthly rate for my internet usage. I realize that Comcast has a business to run but it is also my understanding that this overage program has not been implemented nationwide but only in a select few areas. I question the fairness of this overage program and certainly question their ability to accurately calculate my home's internet usage. The current month is shaping up to be the biggest month yet. I am quite disappointed.

 The Comcast rep still wants to justify their billing and wants me to pay the excessive bill for just internet service. If you do not take an action then it is too bad. They have no justification for the more bill except they own the service in the area and they have no sympathy if you cannot afford.

I've restarted, reinstalled, cleaned cables, followed every troubleshooting process. There are no other service providers in the area. I exchanged the router/modem for a new one, and am still experiencing the same issues where the internet will be ""connected"" but no uploading or downloading for several times a day for periods of up to an hour. Comcast refuses to credit for down time, they will not address the issue at all, their only assistance has been that I need to upgrade to a premium package. With the new modem, it has been broadcasting a separate connection named ""xfinitywifi"" which is not connectable by me, I've asked to have it discontinued as it slows down my already weak transfer of information but it continues to broadcast secondary wifi connections.

 I've been using Comcast for about a year and a half. I decided to try to upgrade my internet service and they offered me a deal in which I would be able get a free trial of their basic cable service, and an upgrade to my internet and my total bill would never exceed $68. Here are the first problems:
 -When the tv equipment arrived it would not work. I was told it was a simple set up, but it took 3 conversations with Comcast to get them to figure out they sent me a faulty box. Which, wasn't actually the problem, they needed to send a tech out to connect the cable outside.
 -First bill was $180.
 -Apparently a ""data usage charge"" suddenly applied (dated back almost 4 months).
 -After speaking with Comcast they promised to remove $50
 -They only removed $20. When contacted about this, they said the tech support person who promised the $50 removal wasn't authorized to do that.
 Decided to cancel Comcast after that. We were told to take our equipment up to UPS and they would take care of it.
 After returning the equipment, I go to pay the final bill.
 -Bill is $346.
 -I am charged $260 in ""unreturned equipment.""
 -They tell me that they will remove it after I contact them.
 -They give a ""collections"" number which I call. After I call I am led through a continuous cycle of automated messages which ask for my info, then a menu selection on where to direct my call. After I select to speak with billing, the automated message starts over completely having me reenter everything I already did enter. Finally it begins to connect me with a customer service rep and promptly hangs up on. This happened SEVERAL times.

1228,"I subscribed Comcast internet service (basic 3Mbps) more than 6 months ago. 2 months ago I got a call from the Comcast representative regarding upgrading my speed, which I declined. Since then I have noticed my internet connectivity has slowed down. Since last one month it has progressively got worse, worse than a dial up system. Moreover, it was getting intermittently getting cut off and so frequent that it was absolutely frustrating . My wife made several calls to the the customer service regarding this. But most of the time, they would only try to reboot the system remotely or say that there is ongoing maintenance in the the neighborhood and the system will be restored after few hours or the next day etc etc. They would not even register our complaints in their system. Last week, she asked a confirmation number of the complaint. They told her they are working in the area and that the service would be restored after 5 PM on Friday. But that never happened. I called again today and initially the automated voice service said that a maintenance service underway till 9 PM around the neighborhood (how come Comcast use the same trump again and again). I managed to speak with one of the customer service rep and underwent painstakingly more than hour of troubleshooting (Similar to what my wife had already done before). At the end she suggested it is better that I would upgrade to a higher speed. ??what. This really hit me. I've been following the news regarding shoddy practices of deliberately slowing the service down to ask you to upgrade. I let her know about these scams and that I may file a complaint. Interestingly, my service is up and running good as it used to. Even after all the notoriety, it seems Comcast hasn't learned its lesson.

1231,"Contacted Comcast in Jan 2015 via non-burner cell to have internet (only service I had), on Jan 31, 2015 (I have call log). My lease was up on Jan 31st. Have lease & ltr confirming move out. On February I paid what I thought was an outstanding balance but in reality was a bill including February and March charges. I did not know this at the time due to hectic relocation to NYC. During this call, agent instead of reviewing charges, status of service (should have been disconnected on 1/31), offered a ""vacation service"" so I wouldn't have to pay installation, connection and deposit once I moved to permanent apt in NYC in March. Already started working in NYC as of 1/5/15 (I have pay stub). Living in temp housing in NYC since 12/30/14 (have receipts), but kept internet in Illinois due to surveillance camera since my boxes were still there until 1/31/2015. I agreed to vacation service of $7 per month for February and March (move in date to perm apt in NYC was 3/15/15). In March I called Comcast to have service transferred from vacation service to cable and internet to NYC but was told:
 1) Comcast does not service NYC
 2) Your regular service was not actually disconnected until a month after your request in January! So Comcast charged AND collected for February regular service, February vacation service, March vacation service and partial April vacation service due to one month in advance billing.
 I have contacted Comcast 13 times (I have phone logs) re my refund but I receive a different answer every single time. Two weeks ago I was told that I had not returned the CABLE TV box but I didn't even have cable.
 As of today's date, Comcast owes me a refund of $148.50. Because of my initial temporary apt situation, I gave Comcast my sister's address in MO. I have given them this address several times. In order to avoid any further confusion, I am using that same mailing address on this complaint.

1232,"I contacted Comcast and I told them all I wanted was the Internet at a reasonable price with out TV. They keep offering me the same over priced deal with TV which I do not want. I am on a budget and I told them that over and over again. I don't want cable at all just Internet at a faster speed and the will not work with me. They only want to give the speed if you pay more and have the cable with it. 140- 150 channels with nothing on is a big waste of money.

1233,"For over 18 months, we have intermittent problems with the very poor internet service, pertaining to extreme slow internet speed. I have not only been put on hold for 20-30 minutes; I have been connected to someone whom I cannot understand and I ask for a supervisor...another 20-30 minutes.
 After so many months and the terrible speeds, I had to get quite vocal about requesting a technician to come and fix the problem. Always something about the wiring at the box was incorrect or there was something that was blamed on the connection at the street. Having to be rather vocal is not good customer service #1, but the attitudes of the customer service (what customer service???) folks. The recording always says ""YOU ARE OUR MOST VALUED CUSTOMER...)! I would hate to see their non-valued customer service. Then it takes forever to get through to someone. I made my 10th call in one year this morning....SLOW SPEED!
 I had to go and get another modem three times, and had to stand in line for 90 minutes. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with. I want to change providers, but there is a large charge to get out of our contract.

1236,"I have been working with Comcast over the past week to try and resolve issues relating to internet
 and telephone service. I had a Comcast representative at my home for 3 hours on Monday, May 18
 installing an X1 box. Since that time, my internet has had speeds of 1-5 mbps instead of the 50 mbps
 that I pay for. I appreciate the change in cable box should not cause an issue with the internet, but
 something went wrong during that visit, or it is an amazing coincidence that the trouble started at the
 same time. I called mid-week to report and problem and was told I would have an appointment on
 Friday. I did not get the appointment until Saturday. On Saturday, after 3 hours, the technician
 indicated there was a problem ""at the box"" outside and a maintenance call was necessary. The
 technician ""guaranteed"" me the maintenance person would be out that same day, Saturday. On
 Sunday, with the problem still not fixed, I called again. I was again assured that the problem would
 be fixed by 4 pm on Monday. It is 9 pm on Monday and the problem is still not fixed. Every time I call
 they seem to have no record of the maintenance request which was submitted by their own
 technician. I have multiple ticket numbers, have been told on numerous occasions how sorry they
 are that I'm having trouble, how they are going to ""escalate"" the problem, they are going to make sure
 I get a call, etc., etc. In essence, quite a bit of meaningless talk and no resolution of the problem. I
 just got off the phone again with Comcast, was told a supervisor would call to help with the problem
 within two minutes and have not received a call back, and that was about 30 minutes ago. I'm not
 sure what else I can do to resolve this problem after repeated attempts."

Consumer also states that he lost two weeks of his billing cycle. Consumer states that Comcast Rep. told consumer that they change his billing date which makes his due date earlier and now his billing cycle is the first week of the month, which that means that they stole 2 weeks of his cycle billing, and now consumer has to be paying late fees.

1241,"Good Afternoon,
 We made a contract with Comcast to set up internet for our business about a month and a half ago. To this day we still have not had service and these people keep wasting our time. It seems that they can not get their acts together. After the contract was made we were supposed to have service within the next 2 weeks. Their contractor was supposed to come within a week to drop a cable through the roof, down into our facility so that the connections could be made, and then the following week their tech would come and install the hardware.
 Two weeks later a tech shows up to do the install...and after searching for the cable they locate it directly on top of our office space...dangling about 20 feet from ground. Since it was directly over our office space..it was not accessible because the tech could not go between the roof tiles to reach it with a ladder. So they set up for the cable to be dropped the following week.
 The following week a gentleman shows up and he says it was to install the hardware. We explained to him they we were still waiting for the cable to be dropped correctly and made accessible for them to be able to do the job. He checked and verified that the cable was not extended and was not accessible for the job to be done. He calls once again and schedules for the job to be done within the following week or two again. Until this point they were handling all the scheduling for the process.
 Finally another guy shows up and he manages to get the cable job done right. He tells us the following week the tech will be out to install the hardware finally. Today is the following Friday that they were supposed to show up...and they did not show. I called over there and their customer service rep tells me that we never scheduled the install of the hardware...which we never did!! They were supposed to be handling it!! So now they tell me we have to wait another 2 weeks to get the hardware installed. This is ridiculous!! We had to bring our IT guy and the company that handles our phones out here every Friday that they were supposed to come to get the job done...and we ended up wasting our money bringing them out here, and we waste these other companies' times because there was nothing to be done here!! At this point we feel insulted by this company...but unfortunately we do need their internet because of its great speed...or else we would have already looked elsewhere. And that is the reason for our complaint.

Then he said that it was in the equipment and we shouldn't be charged. We called Comcast on 6/9/15 and talked to Customer Service and they told us that our account would be credited $99.95 and to give it 2 -3 hrs to show up on our account. We checked on our account and the credit was not there. When we called again and the supervisor told us that we should be charged because we didn't do trouble shooting, which we did, and we told them that it was not fair to charge us. We want to make a complaint and they told us we had to go to Comcast website and complain. We need someone besides Comcast and they told us just comcast. Then they offered to credit us partial amount - we refused and want to make complaint to FCC. We believe we are entitled full amount of $99.95 + $9.50 for late fee + $3.00 Broadcast TV fee which they added to this account also. Totaling: $112.45 - also every month the charge $.40 franchise fee and $.02 for Peg fee and have asked for explanation and have not received answer - are these charges legal?

1243,"I signed up for Comcast Home Security Services in December 2013 and was told that I had 30 days to cancel. I canceled within those 30 days as documented and recorded in their records however the security charges still have been showing up on my bill for the past 16 months along with the other bundled services. When I call to address this addition I was told that I am still under contract however my security services are inactive. I called in January 2014 and told them that my security services were not working and I wanted to cancel. They scheduled someone to come out that did not show up and when I called to report and proceed with cancelling these services because I miss worked for this no show - I was told that they would give me a $100 gift card for my inconvenience, cancel the services and gave me a few free channels to stay with Comcast Internet and Cable services. They also told me that they have a security plan that does not require the 2 year agreement and I can pay that on a monthly basis. I agreed to the gift card and the monthly plan. The next week their technician no showed again and I called to cancel and express my frustrations once again. I was told at that time that I was still under contract and will be charged 2k for early cancellation. I repeatedly spoke with several representatives since then describing my accounts since the Home Security system was installed. It never worked, it's inactive and I am still paying for it. They continue to bill and threatens me with a early cancellation fee if I cancel when I already canceled over 16 months ago.

1246,"I received a robocall from Comcast last Thursday (4/23) informing me that I was approaching “my 300gb cap limit” and that I could log onto http://xfinity.com/mydatausage to find out the details. Naturally, I was shocked and I was thinking to myself – limit, what limit??? I never signed up for internet with a limit and I was never informed of one. (It’s interesting that Comcast uses robocalls to inform it’s customers that they’re approaching their cap limits but never used the robocall to inform them that they’re now being capped.)
 Anyways, I was leaving town the next day (Friday 4/24) and wouldn’t be back till Saturday night (4/25) so I decided to wait until Monday to call Comcast and ask them what’s going on. Plus, I had logged onto the address provided by the robocall and saw that I still had 27gb until I met my 300gb cap and figured since I wouldn’t be using the internet I would be ok until Monday. Well, I was awoken Sunday morning by another Comcast robocall informing me that I’ve exceeded my 300gb cap limit, which is incredibly impossible because I was out of town for most of Friday and Saturday – in other words, I hadn’t used the internet much at all, definitely not 27gb’s worth, since the robocall on Thursday.
 At this point, I’m pretty upset, because it’s my Sunday morning and I’m being bugged again about something that I never purchased (or told) and now clearly there’s a mistake in the data recording (which in itself is a whole other problem and just as concerning).
 Naturally, I call Comcast right away. I talked with ‘Kate’ first, employee #52276, she was nice, difficult to understand due to her English, but after talking to her for a while and wasting a good bit of time essentially she said that I’ve had a cap limit for some time now and that she couldn’t do anything about it and that she would have to transfer me to the next level of care. I was transferred to ‘Joe’ employee #CASTech413. He spoke clear English, easy to understand, but right off the bat was just quoting the 300gb cap limit policy which was already clearly written out on the address provided by the robocall. I explained to him that I never purchased internet with this policy. He replied that I’ve “always had a cap.” I tried explaining to him that I didn’t. In fact, I was with Time Warner RoadRunner here in Memphis since back in 2004 and that when Comcast took over around ?2006? I never purchased internet with a cap, was never told of internet with a cap, or ever received warning of approaching a cap until last Thursday. Joe explained that I did have a cap even during those early years and that it was just “suspended” when I came under Comcast. Then, Joe says that Comcast re-started the cap limit, now at 300gb, in Nov 2013. And he also notes that it’s in the ‘fine print’ that Comcast can do whatever it wants to. Of course, yes, I know the fine print says Comcast can do whatever it wants to, but, essentially, when I ask Joe if he thinks it’s right to tell somebody you’re selling them gold and then really it’s silver, is that ok? He has no response, says he can’t comment on that or something else along those lines. I tell him that I’m not happy with being misled, I was never informed of an internet cap when I was transitioned into a Comcast internet customer way back and that it’s wrong to now enforce a cap limit on long time customers who never signed up for this. If Comcast wants to start placing caps on new customers then I guess that’s their prerogative but they need to honor their old agreements and longtime customers. Joe says that there’s no Comcast
 internet service without a cap limit. I told him there’s the Comcast “Business” lines. He has no comment again, just that he can’t do anything. I ask to speak with his supervisor. Joe says it will take 24hours for his supervisor to contact me. I asked why he couldn’t transfer me to his supervisor now, for which he replied “Because it’s Sunday!” I pointed out to him that it was Comcast who woke me up on Sunday with the robocall. I didn’t hear back from his supervisor, ‘Kyle,’ more than 48 hours later, on Tuesday. I was unable to pick up the phone when he called in the morning. Kyle left a voice message, he gave me his contact information and said to call him back at 1-888-565-4329 ext 11327 and that my case number is NA160067711. I called him back around 2:30PM on Tuesday, went to his voicemail, left him a message to please call me back. I didn’t receive a call from him on Tuesday. He called again Wednesday morning, which I’m unable to pick up weekday mornings, and he left a message indicating that he works 5:30AM-2:30PM eastern time and that if I can’t contact him during these times that I need to just call the 1-888 number above and give my case number to another representative.
 I think this is wrong and rude on several levels. First of all, he took longer than 24hours to call me back (2 days). Second, he didn’t return my call Tuesday when I had placed it early enough in the day, (although maybe not early enough for his work hours, but working for Comcast he should probably know how to pass of customer information to another supervisor that will be on-call during normal operating hours or at least call me back and let me know that he can’t do it and he’s not the right agent due to his hours/time difference and not drop the burden of passing the information on to the customer. Third, I’ve already wasted a lot of time on Sunday talking to two lower level employees, I’m not going to call another 1-888 number and try to explain everything again only to be told I will have to wait for a supervisor to contact me, or be put on hold while somebody unfamiliar with the case has to read it all while I’m on hold.
 I’m paying $80.90 a month for internet. No cable television or phone line. Just internet. Here, there are two Comcast internet flavors – performance (slower) and blast (faster), not including comcast business. I’m not even getting the blast level internet. I’m getting the Comcast performance internet at $80.90 a month. My internet bill has been increasing ever since Comcast has taken over from Time Warner Roadrunner here in Memphis. First they added a modem lease (which I never had with RoadRunner). Then it was the “Service Protection Plan.” I never had to have a service protection plan with Roadrunner and I never did with Comcast at the beginning either but I remember at some point when there was a problem with my internet and they needed to come to my house and check it out, they charged me a lot of money and said that if I get this protection plan then I wouldn’t have to be charged again for them to come out and fix my internet. The oldest bill I can find when I log into my Comcast account is from 5/14/2014 and it shows my modem lease to be $7 back then and my service protection plan to be $3.95. Now, current bill, modem lease is $9 and service protection plan $4.95. And, now, Comcast is saying I have a data cap and that I can pay $10 extra for 50gb. This is wrong on so many different levels, if I had another fast internet option I would switch in a heartbeat. The only other option here is AT&T and their internet here is slower than Comcast’s slower performance package.
 I think it’s fair to say that as internet speeds increase, file sizes / streaming content increase as well. The 1 Terabyte (1000 Gigabytes) computer hard drive came out in 2007. Just a quick google search for hard drives shows that there’s 6 Terabyte hard drives for sale. That’s 6000 Gigabytes. How is it that Comcast arbitrarily calculates only 300 Gigabytes as a fair cap limit? Especially in this age of Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime??

 I have received a phone call from Comcast's ""Nina"" today: 'I saw you filed a complaint with the FCC, I just wanted to see if you had any questions about the data cap policy,' for which I explained again how I did not sign up to this policy, I have zero questions about a policy that I did not agree to. She replied with exactly the same thing Kyle and Joe said - in the fine print it says that Comcast can do whatever it wants to do. When I asked her if she thought it's right to treat customers like that she had no response. After she said that she can't change my policy I told her I had nothing else to say and that I would be complaining to the FCC again."

 shooting solutions failed. i am currently doing this in my phone because the Internet has been out all
 day."
1249,"I've been a Comcast customer since I moved out of my parents' house and on my own. For 6 years,
 I've paid $60-$80 for high-speed internet alone, no cable, no home phone service. In January, I got
 my very first notice that I'd exceeded my ""data cap,"" which I'd never exceeded before, and certainly
 never agreed to when I signed up for my contract. Indeed, this data cap was never discussed on the
 website where I signed up, nor was information on it readily accessible. I called Comcast, and all the
 woman could tell me was that it had always been that way. Interestingly, this was the first call I made
 to customer support that began, ""If you're calling about data limits, press 1."" Let's just say that seems
 pretty shady. So I started monitoring my usage. We're pretty heavy internet users, so in the month of
 April, we averaged about 5-8GB per day, streaming video, playing games, and working from home
 with VOIP and remote desktop connections.
 It's May, and half-way through the month, I got a phone call at 7 am informing me I was nearing my
 threshold for the 300GB data limit. That means Comcast was telling me we'd used 16GB per day of
 bandwidth, without changing any of our habits. Of course, there's no way to monitor daily usage, to
 see what days bandwidth had been used up more than others, or a way to determine if someone was
 mooching off our Wifi-- or any recourse if someone was--, or any way to take matters into our own
 hands and try to abide by this arbitrary limit. Comcast provides its customers with a solitary bar of
 data usage for the entire month, with no way to break it down or determine what activities were
 causing the increase in bandwidth usage.
 Then, there's this:
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5482178
 As we say online, ""tl;dr:"" Comcast is interjecting crappy code into our sessions and sending infinite
 requests every five seconds we're connected to the internet (hint: we're constantly connected). This
 artificially inflates bandwidth, which they're CHARGING ME FOR, simply so they can inform me that
 I'm reaching my monthly bandwidth by plopping a bar into whatever page I'm viewing.
 As noted by the coders on the site, when dial-up ISPs tried to interject ads into web sessions, it was
 found unethical because they were inflating the bandwidth they were charging people for. How is this
 any different?
 Well, for one, it's worse, because the code is flawed and continues to make requests to somewhere in
 the ether where it can't get a response. And I'm being charged for that.
 Let's be real: the time for data caps has long-passed. We're nearing our bandwidth cap lightly using
 Netflix. That says nothing about the people who spend time on MMORPGs, or do any type of
 bandwidth-intensive activities that are now common-place such as streaming video and music or
 broadcasting live streams. There's no cost to offset in providing this service that isn't already covered
 by the $80 I spend every month. We already pay more than nearly every other country for internet
 use, and we're not even getting the best service for our money.
 Top that off with ISPs injecting malicious code which basically functions as a massive DoS attack on
 their customers to drive up the bandwidth, and you're dealing with nothing less than consumer abuse.
 In laymen's terms, this is bull, and you should put a stop to it."
1250,"Comcast putting a 300gb data cap in today's industrial age is appalling. I have blown through nearly 118gb of service in 5 days. You can use 300 gb of service in week of flipping through HD movies. Your average video game is 30gb of data. if you download it is a tenth of your data gone. Not to mention the game you play.

1253,"When I called Comcast customer service, recently, inquiring about the cost of my service; I was informed that I had the lowest package available. I got a bundled package when I first subscribed at a promotional price. It was high, then, and crept higher without notice it was increasing. Now, it's even higher, of course, because the promotional pricing has ended.
 One of the services I don't want is the so-called On-Demand feature and I know I'm paying for it even though it's states it's free. It's useless to me because it's not really what they claim. Why should I pay for something I don't want.
 I would try another provider, but there is no other one available in my area; therefore, Comcast is a monopoly.

1254,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking another package that included a cable subscription when I tried to switch to internet service only despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this new package was 60 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 88 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and just haven't watched cable television. For the past 2 years prior to making this recent switch, my bill for cable & internet was slowly creeping upwards from $124 a month until it recently reached $200 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but was told it would be CHEAPER to continue receiving a reduced level of ""cable"" (really just network channels & home shopping networks) along with internet than just internet alone. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 In addition, I have spoken to several other Comcast customers in my area who do in fact receive ONLY internet service for a substantially lower rate than what I was offered: $19 a month. And, these other customers have been receiving this rate for several years now (but only by calling and jumping through hoops each year to prevent rate hikes). Any honest and fair company would offer the same rates & services to all customers. But not Comcast. Oh no.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides reliable high speed service as defined by the FCC.
 Thank you,

1255,"We have been in touch with Comcast since the 19th of June contesting a jump in our data usage. First of all, it is ridiculous that there is even a data-cap for our home internet usage. The speed is 50mbps and data usage is 300GB for an entire month? And We pay $50 a month for this service? In other advanced Countries such as Finland you would pay €33 - that is for 100mbps internet, no data cap, phone, and cable television. Even in Sweden prices are relatively the same and ISPs still manage to make a considerable profit, why does services like Comcast need to make like a 99% profit, screwing their customers over in the process? Just because this is America and that is 'how things are in America'? Well, America should change then.
 We have been with Comcast since at least January of 2015 and since then We have to our knowledge never exceeded our internet usage cap, many months using the internet far more than We have used it this month. But this month (June) 19 days into the month We received a call, claiming that We had used 90% of 300GB in only 19 days? Absurd.
 Even looking at all of our devices (Data meters on phones and tablets) and our computer which uses the most data of any device in this house We have used only 187,50GB for this computer, 35,34GB for our phone, and 17,63GB for our tablet for a total of 240,47 GB as of June 30th - But Comcast is claiming We have used 398GB+
 We have talked to their customer support, We have talked to their security assurance team, We have security, anti-virus, anti-malware, our router is protected, We have done no major uploading or downloading, and everything is squared away. We have used the internet LESS this month than previous month (May) and somehow still they are claiming their meter is right.
 We have even tried talking to executives and have every call recorded. We have tried -everything,- but they will not yield.
 Comcast is the only provider in our area that has decent high-speed internet since apparently monopolies in America are legal (except they are not, but do not tell Comcast that) and We really do not want to have to cancel our internet, but We will not be screwed over and told We are going to incur overages that they will charge us even more money for when they do not actually deserve it and We have not even used that much data to begin with.
 Comcast claims left and right they have 'verified the data on their side' and that their meters 'are accurate,' but their meters contradict everything We are seeing on this side and We are seeing things from the side WITH THE DEVICES, so you know? They cannot see where is the data coming from, but We can. Who is probably more accurate in this situation?
 We have many things, screenshots and records of the data usage, math, records of the calls, records of past bills, etc and Comcast still argues with us.
 We are tried of being screwed and jerked around, so please help us. The FCC is now the only choice We are left with.

 We should add that when speaking to the Comcast agents on the phone they claimed that We had only had service since May (2015) from May to June - They claimed they had no records before that even though We have bills ranging back to January of 2015, but then suddenly this time when We spoke to an agent recently, they claimed that they had evidence of us going over in April.
 Seems a little odd that they conveniently loose all of the months records except for May and June when We were telling them to look them over and see that our data usage was consistently from 170-180GB and never going over the 300GB cap and then suddenly they conveniently 'find' records from April that they claim We went over when they told us they did not have these records?

 Just talked to one of them on the phone - Whereas previously they claimed only to have records of May and June and had 'lost' everything before that, even claimed that We had not had the service before that they are now claiming that they have 'records' of overages before that, pretty much every single month. However We have never before received any warning of overages, neither call nor email and We have never been charged for overages.
 The representative on the phone claimed that We had gone over our data cap MANY times in the previous months, yet only a single month out of the 'grace months' that We have had ever been used.
 How could We have gone over so many months since January if We still have 2 grace months left? Proving that June is the first month We ever had gone over before and was the first month We ever received a call about overage. This was a bold-faced lie. We also have the recording of this call as well.
 Kinda funny how they magically 'produced' these records now also when they claimed not to have them previously, right?
 So they are pretty clearly lying very blatantly in order to cover up whatever they are doing.
 We will also point out to MANY posts online from other customers that were complaining about their inaccurate data and blatant lies to data usage;

 In reference to the previous entry with the discussion with the representative who lied, further evidence; he claims that multiple emails and calls were sent out, but this is a current screenshot of our Comcast email account in which the only email We have ever received regarding overages is, you guessed it. On June 19th, the literal -first time- We have EVER received any indication of claimed overages.
 As if the 2 remaining overage months still being on our account were not evidence enough that he was lying, this is extra to ensure it is clear.

 Gonna add an update - We recently received an advertisement for the same service We have in the mail from Comcast (Blast! 50mbps) and no where, absolutely -no where- on the advertisement, not even in the small print is a 300gb cap -ever- mentioned on data usage.
 Add onto that their story changed again?
 This previous Friday We had another technician sent out to check some things around the house to ensure the connections were not using more data than they should and not only did he find a damaged wire in the cable box outside which was apparently installed like that or tampered with, he also called his supervisor and informed him what he was there for and what We wanted.
 His supervisor informed him that there is -no such thing- as a 300gb data usage cap or any data usage cap for that matter and We have a -recording- of him on video stating this. So Comcast is doing something -very- shady and We will not be subjected to this ridiculous dishonesty.

 Just assuming at this point that the FCC has also been bought off by Comcast and you will not enforce anything or make them fix them in spite of everything? This is complete bullshit. Data is not a limited commodity and the only thing that costs them is the speed of the internet, which We pay $50,00 a month for 50mbps, that in and of itself is ridiculous but We were willing to pay for that.
 Not this 'moving data' data cap shit. No.
 So We suppose what We will do is collect all the evidence We have; screenshots, recordings of Comcast calls, and advertisements in which a 300gb datacap is mentioned NO WHERE on the advertisement and bring them to the local news and try to create a PR shitstorm since the FCC seems incapable or not to give a damn to do anything."

1259,"I have been having problems with my Comcast internet for the last 6 months. I keep calling and they try to get me to trouble shoot over the phone but this does not seem to work. I was told a technician would come out several times and he has only be out twice within a 6 month period fixing very little. Once he changed out a cable and it only worked for 4 days the next time he switched out the modem and left without making sure everything was working. I called when I got home and told them that it was not working and asked for someone to come out the next day and fix and was told someone would be out between 3-5 the next day and no one showed. I called on Friday and was told that someone would be out Saturday between 8:30 am and 9:00 am. I am still having the same issue... and nothing has been resolved. I have now been given an appointment for a trouble call but I am afraid the tech will not show up for this appointment as well. Meanwhile, I was told I needed to upgrade my services so that I may have faster internet. I was given an appointment time and day and no one showed up. I was told I could install it myself , so I picked the equipment up on Saturday. My house is not wired for Comcast so I was told July 8,2015 was the earliest available. All I want is for my new services to be installed within a timely manner because I was given to missed appointments and my internet services to be fixed.
 •Told we were able to self-install: not true
 •3 appointments set up, 2 total no-shows
 •I was called a liar, shuffled, hung-up on, lied to
 •Spoke to several ""supervisors"", promised techs would show up, given discounts and free services, no actual help
 •6 days of awful headache dealing with them before we could be connected

1260,"Summary: I am having difficulty with Comcast, which is violating a contract I signed for business services. It is now trying to collect money from me that I don’t owe and has turned my account to a third party collections agency, Southwest. My credit score has been negatively impacted. The amount in dispute is $1892.32.
 I used to be a business service customer. I early terminated my account after moving to an area of the country where they don't provide service, thus allowing me to break the contract without penalty.
 I have alerted them to my new status; on two occasions sent them proof of my new address. Yet in June they billed me for the remaining amount after two months of silence during which I assumed all was fine.
 After numerous calls with Comcast after receiving this new bill, I was assured this would get resolved. Yet on June 19, 2015 I received a call from a third-party collections agency, Southwest, requesting payment.
 This is what I want: for this issue to be resolved once and for all without me having to spend hours more on the phone (I estimate with wait times I have spent about five hours all together).
 I also want whatever penalty is possible to be slapped on Comcast including a public report of this complaint. I want this report to highlight the fact that I was a business customer.
 Here is the a detail chronological account of my travails with Comcast:
 I had a business account with Comcast for high-speed internet access, as well as cable and phone. I had to early terminate the account because I was moving to a state where Comcast didn’t offer service. Under the terms of the agreement, I would not have to pay an early termination fee. I alerted Comcast to my new status in mid-March. They agreed I was indeed allowed to cancel without penalty. They asked for proof of my new address. I sent it in by fax to FAX: 800 283 8873 in March 2015.
 Up until that point my account was in good standing and of course I was receiving monthly bills. After that conversation I no longer received bills from Comcast – which are sent to a bill paying service and not my service address or new address. I assumed all was fine.
 Around the first week of June, I received a bill forwarded to me at my new address, for the remaining amount due of $1892.32. The bill was dated 5-21-15; with the forwarding it took a while to reach me.
 On June 9 I spoke with a rep who said she would try to rectify the issue. She left me a voice mail later to say she could not and I should call the retention office.
 On June 13 – a Saturday – I tried again. I was told to call on Monday but was assured my account wouldn’t go into collections. The ticket number for that call is CR472100806.
 On Monday June 15 I spoke with an agent Lauren (CEA4R). She told me the proof of new address hadn't arrived and gave me an email address to use. I emailed the proof of new address to ned_smbdisconnectrequest@cable.comcast.com on 6-16.
 On 6-19 I received a collections call from Southwest collections regarding my account.
 I called Comcast and spoke with Sherry ( ID is 18264) who put me on hold to speak with collections. After a lengthy wait she came back to tell me that she spoke with collections and that my account had indeed been turned over to a third party. She said the collections department put in a request to this third party collections agency to stop the calls. She didn’t give me an answer to my question as to whether my credit report had been affected.
 I informed her I would be filing a report with the FCC. She told me I would have to speak with the legal department. I was starting to say something when she cut me off in mid-sentence and the call was disconnected.
 I called Comcast once again on that same day and spoke with Patti (67320).
 She was very helpful and promised to speak with collections directly to have them reach out to Southwest to let them know the account was transferred in error.
 On that day I also emailed her several other pieces of identification that showed my new address ""just in case"" as she put it. Please keep in mind that I had already emailed a proof of address change to Comcast on June 16.
 However when Patti went to look for this proof she told me that the disconnect office ""couldn’t find it."" I re-emailed the original proof – a utility address from Atmos. Plus a proxy notice from Fidelity and a home/car insurance statement from State Farm – all with my new address on it.
 Patti told me that apparently these decisions have to be approved. This comes as a surprise given that Comcast clearly doesn’t offer service in my new area. I am not sure what has to be approved.
 She did give me her address and email:
 Patti Long
 Comcast Billing Specialist
 Comcast Business – Northeast Division
 676 Island Pond Road, Manchester, NH 03109
 On June 23 I received another call from Southwest on behalf of Comcast. The agent's name was Kadarius.
 I am through dealing with Comcast. Please take up this matter on my behalf.
 Again let me repeat: I want this issue resolved without me having to go through their hell of a customer service operation.
 I want whatever penalty possible applied to Comcast including public notice of this complaint. I want it specified that I am not an individual customer but got their services through their business unit, which promises prompt attention.

 Hello,
 On April, 28th our internet with Comcast was cancelled and a subsequent payment of $21.28 was paid to zero the account out. We are still being billed by Comcast, although every time we call Comcast they say the bill "" will zero out next cycle.""
 Comcast has been very incompetent in terms of the whole experience we had, by playing games on pricing (advertising one price, then operators claim that it is not available anymore, and having to have upwards of 10 different calls to correct that!) I have had it up to here with Comcast. I need some help getting them to correct their error that doesn't involve me spending the rest of my life on the phone with them.
 Please help!

1264,"I have tried for months now to get Comcast service into my home. A price was offered and service requested. The service has been absolutely the worst and I can only imagine that they want me to give up. The details are too long to enter here. But in brief. After several months of dealing with them I thought they would finally send the right person out to the house. What we need is for them to get the cable line from the main source which is 20 yards from my property connected to my house. Then they can send a technician to install the cable TV, internet and telephone service. They have repeatedly set appointments (giving anywhere from 2 hours to 8 hour windows everytime). Either no one shows up or the wrong people show up. I've had two or three surveys done that supposedly identifies the work that needs to be done. They have come to the house 5 times already but always send the wrong person. They seem to be unable to have someone dispatch the person that can bore a hole and bring the cable to my property. I've spent countless hours (literally being put on hold for 1 hour in order to speak to a supervisor and eventually only got her assistant) on the phone and always with a different person because they don't call you back or follow up even though they have promised many times to call back and follow up. It happened again today, where they promised this time to send the correct person and again it was the wrong person. In fact it was a guy who has himself been to the house now 3 times. He's laughing at this point. Comcast always sends a subcontractor who tells me they have no way to call someone directly at Comcast. I've gone to their local office and get no help even though they also promised to follow up. A year or so ago, before I even thought of getting Comcast, when they asked for my permission to have access to my property so they could lay some cable down our street I agreed. But now that I want them to connect that cable to my house they seem inept and unable to do anything properly. I especially hate that I have no way to follow up with anyone, always having to start over with a new sales person. I've spoken to countless supervisors who are equally incompentant it would seem, unless their aim is to have me give up so that they don't actually have to lay the cable to my house. I need help . This is issue is about Internet, Cable TV and Phone service.

1265,"I have been a customer of Comcast and subscribe to their phone and internet services since August of last year and have had issues ever since. I trade stocks from home and work off real time quotes and information so obviously a reliable connection is vital. I base my transactions on milliseconds one wrong move can hurt me financially. So when I have no connection and I can't work at all. The router I received has very poor wifi capability from what the numerous technicians have told me. If my internet happens to work it is usually 1-3 mbps and not the internet speeds as agreed upon 25 mbps. I have been paying $125/month for this non service. This is not a matter of leisure, this is how I feed my family and earn a living. This has caused me to lose thousands of dollars over the past few months. I have scheduled appointments where they don't show up then reschedule me claiming I called in to do it on my own. I had an appointment with a Comcast Technician not a sub-contractor this past Monday 3/30/15. Based on the previous tech's recommendation the work to be done was to upgrade my modem to a better wifi capability, the XB3 and install an outlet and hardwire my desktop so I can receive the most reliable connection. I called in several times to confirm this and the reps all told me that was correct. Then my wife and I were receiving automated calls every 10 minutes all week till 10 pm at night to remind us of the appointment. It was driving us mad. I called and complained about this the night before my appointment (3/29/15) and spoke to a supervisor named Gary ID# 191611. He told me there was nothing he could do. The following day I called Comcast after the tech didn't show up during the scheduled time of 5-7 pm and was told I cancelled it and rescheduled it for 4/2/15 between 5-7pm according to Julie ID# 1009571 in Colombia. This was impossible. That date was my son's 21st birthday and we had invited our family visiting us for the holidays at 7pm. My wife had to stay home and miss our son's birthday because of Comcast. The tech showed up at 8 pm, an hour and a half passed the scheduled window and never installed an outlet. He claimed he never had an order to upgrade me and in the end used a Direct TV connection and used a splitter. He said that Comcast always does this to customers and the communication between the techs and the agents are terrible. Even though I was told I would not be charged for all of my inconveniences by Comcast agents he still charged us $30 and we still have no wireless internet.

 I've been having issues trying to get a tech out to connect my service they finally came out on may 7th to connect my service when the tech showed up he told me that because of the time that he was sent out that I had to pick and choose which service I wanted I called Comcast while the tech was out and complain all of a sudden the tech was able to do all the services at the same time two other techs came out in total of 3 they did the work as they were doing the work all three of them were talking about how they can get more money doing other jobs and talking about how they should get a good tip it's very unprofessional and rude to have the employees talking like that in front of customers on top of that they are making me renew a contract just because I'm transferring services to a new address I am on a two year contract currently which out of the two years I've only been on it six months I find it weird that I have to renew the contract all over just for transferring services to a new address I was never aware of that when I spoke to them to transfer the services called today woke to a supervisor named Rob he told me there's nothing that he can do because a work order is still open I explained to him how upset I was and still he told me there's nothing that he can do please I need help with my situation I've been dealing with this for a long time they're still collecting their money I
 still have to pay installation fees although I'm getting bad service and all my services are still not working everything is connected in place but I still cannot watch cable TV use my internet"
1268,"I am under a household that is currently subscribed to Comcast's xfinity service, and I would like to go
 on record to say that the service is abhorrent and unreliable."
1269,"Often my modem, which I rent through Comcast and who I pay $60/month to for high speed internet,
 just fails to connect for several hours. This occurs weekly and randomly. I have gone through the
 comcast troubleshooting, had comcast replace the modem and had the modem externally refreshed
 through comcast, but the service failures have not changed. Comcast customer service ignores my
 complaints during phone calls. I was recommended to file a complaint since normally I would just stop
 using their poor service, but they have a monopoly here in Kendall, Miami."
1270,"I have owned my own Modem for 8 years and started to get Modem Rental Fee as of August 2014
 and they reversed charges after checking, but two months latter it happens again, and again
 reversing charges then get Modem Rental again. Now I am being told that I have to provide an 8
 year old receipt and bring my Modem to a Store or else they THINK / feel they own the Modem. I
 have to find an 8 year old receipt and drive to a Comcast location to prove my modem is mine which
 they admit for 7 and half years was mine. They are charging me $10 for renting the modem I have
 purchased for $90, 8 years ago.

 Hello Eve,
 After spending valuable time researching my records and my wife’s credit card records, your request
 to find a receipt for the Modem has been found luckily it was purchased through AMAZON, which has
 better record keeping than COMCAST. The Modem was purchased with Amazon Visa Card with
 details below. (Proof of Purchase of Modem below )
 I would appreciate if you can make corrections to your records and refund me all Modem rental Fee's
 since July 29,2011 which was the date the modem was activated. Please make real permanent
 record keeping and refund me all modem rental fees. Please also make lasting notes on my record. I
 hope Comcast updates it's record keeping or subcontracts a company that has better documentation
 ability and billing.
 I want to be notified of your resolution and actions taken to satisfy this mistake made by Comcast,
 remedy to victim and how in the future you will not do this again to me or .
 Regards,

 modem that was activated with COMCAST in July of 2011 , Motorola SB5120 Surfboard Cable
 Modem . All my statements and copy of documents I am providing you is accurate and to the point.
 I have provided you documentation on purchase and return of old modem and dates that mean
 something since I have proof. Comcast seems to have a glitch in record keeping. A utility such as
 Comcast should maintain better records. Please reverse modem rental charges that have been
 charged to me. It may be a few months’ worth. Somehow your records were good until late 2014 then
 some computer screw up has caused you to bill customers in error. You can always reach me at
 (305)807-4923 .. I hope the information I have provided you and attached document will help fix your

 I have provided receipt for modem and statement of return of old modem in 2011. I like to know how
 the old modem and new modem could have been connected to the same address?
 Can you please provide me a copy of your records showing I signed for the modem you think is yours
 !
 The receipt I provided has model number and date of shipping and I provided the date the modem
 was installed on my line at my local Comcast office.

 Dear Eve,
 I have never purchase an device and had the MAC address printed on the purchase statement. If you
 can provide me a DOCUMENTATION / statement that shows MAC address of Modem I would
 appreciate it.
 Please provide me document showing my use or signature of January 29,2008 for a modem that was
 actually purchase in July 2011 ???? I returned your modem in July 2011 and activated my modem in
 July 2011.
 If you like to take this to the next level, I will contact Amazon and waste their time and mine to get a
 MAC ID for the Modem purchased in July 2011. But I truly think I will have to send copy of this with
 my representatives in the US Senate and Congress.
 Do me a favor and look up how many months this Modem rental has actually been charged to me in
 Error. If you reverse all charges and give me credit for $73.83 toward purchase of a newer modem
 then I will do so as a modernization program , but I am not willing to pay a modem rental FEE when I
 have purchased a new Modem and provided evidence of my purchase.
 Respectfully ,
 Miami, FL 33157

 thing. Neither company mentioned a monthly fee for the modem. It wasn't until I recieved my bill that I
 was told that there would be a monthly fee of 10.00 for the use of their modem. (Comcast). Comcast

1274,"I have been a loyal customer for more than five years and I have been experiencing a poor internet
 service and an astonishing amount of negligence to solve it.
 My last two bills have been $158 and $190 for 50 mbs internet and basic cable plus latino package,
 YES, But the worst part is, I usually receive less than 10 mps and sometimes a ridiculous reading of 1
 or 2mbs. I work from home and my internet disconnects at least FIVE times a day impacting my
 productivity. I can't watch a netflix movie entirely because I lost signal and I can't work wirelessly
 because the signal is ""schizophrenic"".
 Comcast sent an IT Tech who did nothing but to unplug and plug my modem and tried to engage me
 in ""Personal Business"" asking me to let him ""do the job"" outside of comcast... Totally unacceptable.
 the worst part... I was charged $70 for that atrocity, I was given a partial credit on that. another
 technician visited my place and told me that the service cannot be improved, I consulted my
 neighbors and they told me that their service is very poor... Comcast has been negligent to improve
 the service in my building but have collected based on a bad service. When I called about this
 situation, the representative suggested me that the only thing to do is to change my speed connection
 to 100mbs and bundle my services, he offered it as a courtesy for the horrible services, but I only
 received more mislead.
 I was charged with this ""change in speed"" and my bill went from $130 to $155, and my DVR services
 were suspended, when I called to inquire about it they told me that the DVR would cost extra.
 In sum, I have been paying for an internet service of 50 mbs and I only receive 10 in average and
 sometimes as low as 1mbs, COMCAST is aware of the situation but negligent to solve it. The
 building has a bad connectivity but they prefer to deal with each customer directly before solving the
 root of the problem. They charge money for a service they don’t provide and they are negligent to
 solve it."
1275,"Hello,
 I switched to Comcast on May 1st/2015.
 I called and purchase a $89.00package (internet,tv and phone)
 and they told me they will be here on the 6th. When the technician came he said he didn't come to install anything but just to check . So after begging him to at least install the internet, he told us to call comcast and get another ticket number.
 We did call Comcast and explain the situation, and the customer service rep told me that yes it can be done and gave me another ticket number. Also that rep told me to call right away after the installation of the internet, so he can get the package going with the tv and phone.
 I did call immediately, after the internet was installed, and guessed what, there was not record of me getting an $89.99 package, just the internet……I almos fainted.
 Then after spending an hour talking to the rep, he sold me another package for $89.99 again and made an appointment for the 7th.
 On the 7th nobody showed up and I called again and they told me there was no record of me getting a new $89.00 package…..What ??? I couldn’t believe my ears.
 Again after an hour with the new rep again, he sold me a new ( number 3) $89.99 package and made an appointment for may 11th.
 They did show up and left a cable hanging from the pole to the back of my house, They gave me an appointment for may 28th to come and bury the cable.
 But they didn’t install the tv or the phone, he said he was not instructed to do that.
 Again, I called and they told me to go to the Comcast store and get the receivers and that I could install them myself.
 We went there and picked them up, and they sent a technician that wanted to charge us $15.00 per receiver to install them……We went there and picked them up and still we have to pay for a service that was not done on the first appointment?
 As of that date the phone service was not working yet. I called everyday and they always said the problem is in their end and that they will resolve it in a few days…….
 They finally did resolve it on May the 29th. Unbelievable !!!!!
 After that I got a bill from them charging me with $69.60 for 4 days of internet services…what?????? $69.60 for four days?
 I called and told them that it was impossible for them to charge me that amount for 4 days and they went around and around trying to explain and still I don’t get it.
 But my biggest complaint is that they gave me an appointment on May 11th for May the 28th for burying the cable, and their time frame was from 8:00am to 11:00pm at night, can you believe that? Until 11:00pm we had to be up waiting for them, And nobody showed up or called me.
 I called again and they gave me an appointment for yesterday , June 2nd from 8:00am to 11:00pm. Because I know that they don’t keep appointments I called at 11:00am and at 6:00pm to re-confirm the appointment and they assured me that yes !! the appointment was for yesterday.
 At 8:00pm I called again and guessed what they told me that it was not any appointment scheduled for me for yesterday !!!! what ???? I couldn’t believe my ears…. And today june 3rd I haven’t heard from them at all.
 I did call a minute ago and they said they re-scheduled the appointment for june 15th……what ?????? no way, I told them either they come today and do it or I will cancel the service….
 I just want to finish this complaint to tell you that Comcast customer service is the worst of all……Nobody knows anything, none of your calls get recorded, they don’t make notes, so when you call again nobody knows anything ….it is frustrating.
 Im really tired and exhausted of Comcast.
 I don’t have even a month with them and see how this is going !!
 I hope that you as a communication authority can do something about it because this is disrespectful for the consumer……
 They don’t care at all…..The only thing that they care is that you pay on time other wise they will disconnect the service….
 I just paid a bill for $244.19 which I believe it is very ,very exaggerated…
 Hoping to hear from you very soon,
 Thanks a lot for your time, reading my complaint….

 Update: On June 2nd when I called to complaint about no show for the appointment, I spoke with Michael a supervisor and he said he ""escalated"" the complaint to higher personnel and that they will give a solution to the problem no later that friday the 5th.
 Well today june 4th I am talking to the customer service guy named Cesar in this moment and he doesn't have the slightest idea of any escalation on my situation......In other words that was not documented by Michael the supervisor when I called on the 2nd. and this Cesar told me that they re-scheduled me for June 15th, in other words when they felt like it.....not when I requested it to be before that date. They didn't take into consideration the two days that I was waiting for them from 8:00am to 11:00pm on may 28th and june 2nd.
 I asked to talk to a supervisor again...I waited 20 min on the phone and no one was available at that moment....Of course they don't want to talk to me.......
 That's Comcast....
 You can see how frustrated I am......Comcast is playing games with Customers.....
 I really hope the listen to you, the FCC, because somebody has to put a STOP to them...

 Hello FCC...
 Thanks for listened to my complain and for taking care of it so fast...
 As of today June 10th/2015, my problems with Comcast has been resolved satisfactorily .
 Mr Roger G. from the Executive Team, handled everything in a very professional way.
 He fixed all my problems and so far I have no more complaints.
 He said, he will improve the Customer Service training, so the customers will not have to struggle like me to open an account with Comcast.
 Im glad I talked to him..... and because of that Im glad I have Comcast as my service provider....
 In the same way I complaint about them a few days ago, I have to say today, they have an excellent, knowledgeable and professional Executive Team...

 Hello FCC
 On June 10th after I sent you a note about that how well Comcast resolved my issue, which I described so lenghty on my previous complaint to you....Well now here I am a month after, because they are overcharging me.....
 Talking to the Comcast Executive Team Manager Roger Grier, he offered me as a reward for all my problems with Comcast, one month free.....
 Well they now said that it can not be possible......
 They even suspended my service yesterday, because I did not pay them because I knew I have a free month...
 Comcast is the #1 worst customer service on the USA...
 As you know they made me go thru horrible experience while dealing with them
 I only have 2-1/2 months with them and already hate them.....
 Another one of my concern was that when they came in the first time the left all the inside wiring hanging, they didn't even bother to staple them....
 And they also were supposed to bury the cable from the pole to my house, and yes they did it after a millions of my call, but they did it very sloppy leaving the cable showing , so now when we are mowing our lawn we have to watch so we don't cut that cable.....
 I hope that thru you I can get a hold of somebody from Comcast, since thru the regular channels we cannot talk with any supervisor or somebody with some power....
 They all are calling centers from all over the world who simply dont care....
 Thanks for your help !!"
1277,"Since April the 13th 2015 I have been promised cable installation with Comcast. After 4 service technician visits whom all declined for various reasons why thework could not be done and multiple conversations with all the different departments of Comcast and being told I would have cable, as of June 15, 2015 I still have no service. Several Comcast supervisors have promised to notify me where they have the solution to my lack of service. The lack of communication with the company is inexcusable. Please advise me of my rights.

1278,"I contacted Comcast before May 29 to move my services from to my new address. I was given an appointment date of June 1. No one ever showed up or called. On June 2, I called to cancel service. I was advised I would receive a confirmation email. None came. I called again June 5 and was advised the same. Again, no email. I did receive a call asking where would I like my services moved. I advsed this representative this request should have been cancelled. Contacted a third time and was told it was completely cancelled no worries. Today June 19, I received a new bill for another month of service. I have not used the service since May 29 and do not want to be charged for service after this time. A comcast chat representative confirmed with me today she was able to see the service has not been used. I would also like this service cancelled and the account closed. This has been the worst experience of my life since even before the services were installed. Constant calls and chats to comcast for things that should be automatically done or quite simple to accomplish.

 I was contacted by Gwendolyn J on 6/22/15 in regards to my complaint. She advised that she would close the account as of my first request date May 29 and correct the balance. She also advised me to return the equipment, which I have done. As of 6/26/15 there had been no action taken on the account by Comcast. It is still open and active and still accruing fees. They have also scheduled an appointment for relocation of services for July 18, which I did NOT request. I have emailed Gwendolyn in regards to this and received no response from her since our initial contact. Once again, I would like this account CLOSED.

1279,"I bought Internet service from Comcast on 09/06/2015. They send the equipment two days later. I tried to self-installed and I wasn't able because there was something wrong with the wire box outside my house (apparently the access is set up fir ATT , my former provider) Therefore, they just need to send a technician, switch the cables outside to guarantee my access to Comcast signal and we are done. So, I schedule one first appointment, the technician never showed up. I called and spoke to a supervisor, she offered me a discount and said she would send somebody right away. That second appointment, no one showed. I called a supervisor, they said they were sorry and that the next day, from 8 to 10 a.m. someone would be here. They did not show. I called a supervisor, this time, the guy was very arrogant and said, you are talking to the right person, ""I got your back"" like if we were friends... I hung up on him, and he gave me a call back saying everything was ready, he would send somebody... no one showed,. On the 19th, I decided to call the Corporate Office in Philadelphia, the Relations Department told me that they were sorry, and that now it was in the hands of Corporate, it would be solved, that I would be contacted by Comcast before the day was over. Nobody called. I waited and waited. Today Monday 22th, I contacted Corporate back. They said, we are sorry, let me contact the regional office right now. She called and got no answer, so she said, I am going to send an email, they will be contacting you soon... and I said, thank you.
 I have made about 11 phone calls to Comcast, my estimated time on the phone, is more than 3 hours altogether. Since it all must be recorded, that should be enough evidence to prove my case.
 I have lived a nightmare. It is sad that a human being just trying to buy a service in America has to go through such humiliation.

Guess what? No promotional price. Called in, told that for some reason it didn't take and I must pay full price. I ask them to honor the promo and told that they can't because I am not an existing customer and promos are only for new customers. Multiple hours on the phone, 4 people, and no resolution. They won't honor their special internet pricing for new customers and won't let you cancel because you're now in a contract with them.

1285,"Internet speed is always at dial-up. I have been running speed checks and the speed is always at, or below dial-up. Comcast charges me for fast speed. Customer service is non-existent. When I finally got through to them, they acknowledged I haven't had more than dial speed, and they said, ""We want to see you least at half the speed you pay for."" Find it interesting that right about the same time as Comcast began advertising it's ""new fast internet speeds"" and it has a person sitting there trying to use internet which is uploading at dial-up speeds and it's new super service...how many people are calling in complaining about speeds and are getting upgraded? (Sounds like a money making scheme to me!)

 Thank you for your help. I just received Comcast's reply to you. Although the issue was eventually cleared up, it was not just a matfer of a new motem. They gave me a new motem which was insufficient (I had to go pick It up and return it). It upped the speed for 1 day and my service dropped (b) (6)
 to dial up speed again. The combination of my having contacted you, and you them, was followed by a phone call from themx a total walk through ( but I had to drive 20 miles to receive the new equipment and 20 miles back). Comcast had a representative who was actually tech savvy work with me for a day and the problem was fixed. So, despite Comcast's response it was just a matter of a new motem, there was a bit more involved. However, at the end, They did offer a credit for the slow speeds were had been receiving.
 I thank you for your help in this matter, and truly believe had the FCC not been involved, The outcome would have been much different.

1286,"On 4/23/15 I scheduled a move order online to move my services from one location to another. I was provided a confirmation number and a commitment date of 4/28/15 to have a technician install the services between 1pm to 5pm. This morning, the morning of 4/28/15, I called Comcast to confirm my appointment time frame to discover they had no record of my move request within their system. I was then transferred to their Customer Relations department where the agent ordered the service again at my new location. I was then provided a due date of 5/13/15 initially which I stated was not acceptable due to the circumstances and the fact that I work from home over the Internet. After being placed on hold for over 30 minutes the call mysteriously disconnected. I called back and was advised by another agent within Customer Relations that my due date was now 4/30/15. I again explained the situation to the agent who then proceeded to transfer me to the Billin department. This began the transfer train for 4 hours between the technical support, billing, customer service and dispatch departments. After an additional two hours on the phone I was advised numerous times by multiple representatives that their supervisors were not able to take my phone call, that their supervisors were either at lunch, in a meeting, or flat out they would not transfer me to their supervisors. I spoke to a total of 32 agents during this 8 hour feud to have my services activates today. After finally getting to a supervisor within the technical support department she advised me that it was too late in the evening to assist me with the matter, that she would have to follow up tomorrow and get it resolved. She failed to provide me her name, title or any commitment information at all. My services should've been on today and I should not have to had waste an entire day and over 8 hours of talk time on this issue to no avail. On top of it all I was lied to, hung up on, blind transferred to other call queues and treated extremely poorly and with respect. I have never had to deal with a situation like this and even when I considered cancelling the services all together I was advised sharply by the supervisor ""it would cause me more harm than good.""

1289,"We pay for ""up to 100Mbps"" of download speeds per month. The speeds we receive are wildly
 inconsistent and barely usable."
1290,"The only available broadband ISP (Comcast) in my neighborhood will not lower my service costs if I chose to just have internet without cable. At one point in time I was on a promotional program that offered service for $39.95 for just internet. Once this expired, my rates went up to $76.95. I called them and they said that by bundling TV I would get a discount. Which I did as I was not willing to pay $77 for just internet. This brought my rates down for some time, but they have slowly crept back up and were much higher than the initial cost of $39.95 . Now I am paying over $70 for both internet and cable. Which makes it cheaper to have both, but I am not sure why I have to have both. One would think that by having one without the other you would pay less, not more service for less.
 Comcast should offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I didn't want in the first place.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

1291,"I purchased a new house and tried to transfer internet service to the new address. After calling to confirm, I was told my account was sent to collections because of a delinquency. I have not missed a payment nor have I been late in making any payments. Someone made a mistake on Comcast's part and my account was locked. The address we were transferring to was a newly built house. No one had ever lived there before, yet Comcast claimed there was a delinquent account at that address in my name. Again, this was a newly constructed home never having been occupied. It is impossible for there to be a delinquent account under this address in my name. I spent over an hour on the phone with multiple Comcast employee's before I finally cancelled my account all together. The only problem is Comcast is the only provider of internet in my area. The supervisor I spoke to last could not have cared less about the inconvenience being forced upon me or the fact he was losing a customer.

 My issue with comcast has not been resolved. I no longer a customer and would like my complaint filed. I have no interest in dealing with comcast after this ordeal.
 Thank you, (b) (6)"
1292,"Comcast has charged me a bit over $100 for a sports package that they added to my account when I
 transfered apartments back in July of 2014, I did not ask for this sports package, and they did not
 notify me that it was added to my account. I just found out about them charging it to my bill after I
 noticed my bill climbed noticeably since the summer. They're also charging me for a modem that has
 voice/phone capabilities, which on paper appears that I am paying for something I don't need/want.
 Also, I have a bundled account which includes TV and internet, I have been receiving a $23.96
 bundle discount up until I was billed in April when they stopped giving me the bundle discount.
 Below I have attached three bills,
 1) April 2015 bill to show the dropped discount
 2) March 2015 bill to show the discount
 3) July 2014 bill to show added sports package
 4) June 2014 bill to show no sports package
 I understand that I am wrong for not checking my bill at a more periodic basis to examine it for errors,
 on the contrary, as a paying customer to comcast for almost 4 years now, I fail to see where
 miserable business practices such as ""sneaking"" charges onto account without notifying the paying
 customer that the charge is taking place. Secondly, I am now paying $162 a month roughly for a
 bundled service which for having to deal with them sneaking charges into my account is totally
 unacceptable. This is not the first time comcast has done this to me."
1293,"Comcast has been throttling my Internet for weeks at a time and once I call and complain a few times the issue is fixed for a week or two before it happens again. It's basically on a schedule and it makes my Internet so slow that it's unusable and I have to use my phones Hotspot. My family pays for Internet and half the time we can't use it. This seems like a violation of our contract to me.

1294,"There are several issues I have to report. Billing (bait and switch, not telling me about certain costs and horrible service)
 First, the billing:
 I was quoted the following twice - once via a phone conversation with Comcast sales and the other when I went to the local Comcast.Xfinity store in San Rafael, CA. My sales rep was Felix Hernandez.
 I was only signing up for internet service:
 $29.99/month for the first year. Then, I have to add $25/month after the year is up, per month.
 $5/month for the Blast! service
 $35 for a one-time installation fee.
 Today, just 4 days after FINALLY getting the service set up (although it is not working as it is supposed to work - I was quoted between 60-75mbps wirelessly and I am only getting up to 24mbps), I receive a bill.
 **The bill reflects $39.99 after a discount.
 **The install fee had been waived because of the complete ineptness of getting this service set up. That was still reflected on the bill, even though I was told it would be removed.
 ***There is a charge for their ""Protection Plan"" which I was never told about, never asked about and it was added without my knowledge or permission.
 ***I was told by Russ in the ""Loyalty"" department that the Blast! service will go to $12/month after 1 year. Again, this was not something I was told by either of the sales people when inquiring about and even when I signed up for the service.
 I even have an email from the sales rep from the local San Rafael office that does not reflect these prices are good for one year.
 NOW FOR THE INEPTNESS OF SERVICE
 May 28 - I signed up for Internet service, with Blast! service (me providing my own modem) at the Xfinity store in San Rafael, CA. Felix Hernandez was my sales rep. He set the install to happen the next day between 4-6pm.
 I called Customer Service the evening of March 28th to confirm the appointment just because of all of the nightmare stories I hear about Comcast. I am glad I called because they did NOT have it on the schedule, even though the appointment was allegedly set up by my sales rep.
 May 29 - Comcast tech, Edward arrived at 7:30pm. There was no phone call saying he would be delayed. There was absolutely no communication whatsoever. (I am used to getting a call about 20 minutes ahead of time from DirecTV techs, so my time is not wasted) Clearly, Comcast couldn't care less.
 The tech could not find a cable from the pole to my house and he needed the ""bucket truck"" guy because there was a tree in the way of the pole. Fine. No problem.
 He told me *I* had to call to set that up.
 So, I call to schedule both the ""bucket truck"" tech and the installation tech.
 I asked to be transferred to a Supervisor, Christine, who told me she would ""schedule both to arrive between 4pm-6pm"". I told her, ""the bucket truck tech needs to come out first and should be scheduled earlier than the installation guy in case he is late, since my experience is that they don't show up on time, anyway. "" I asked what happens if the tech shows up before the bucket truck guy? She replied, ""No, no, that won't happen. I laughed and told her that of course it can happen"".
 She was in control of this and she set both up to arrive on Tuesday, March 31st. I called Customer Service and asked to speak with a Supervisor because so far, nothing was going well. She said that she would ""call me before the next tech comes out and would call me after he leaves to make sure everything is satisfactory"". Did she call at all? NO. She did nothing she said she would.
 March 31st. The bucket truck guy never showed. I called to ask what the problem was and no one had any idea. ""Timothy"" the Petaluma supervisor called and told me he would be handling everything from this point onward and I should call for any issues. He still wanted to send his inside tech guy. I asked Why? It's a waste of my time and your time and money since he cannot do anything. Edwards showed up again, this time at 7pm. There was nothing he could do. So, he left.
 I then called the Corporate office and spoke with a Corporate Executive Customer Service rep, Keisha. She arranged for a Regional service rep, William Ward to manage my case. The same lines were told to me, ""Call me any time and I will take care of things. We want you to be happy"".
 Wednesday, April 1st - the bucket truck guys showed up and ran the cable while I was away.
 I had to call Comcast AGAIN to schedule the inside tech to connect things. That was set up for Friday, April 3, again between 4-6pm
 April 3 - This tech showed up between the appointment time - arriving at 5:45pm. He connected things. They worked. But, he did not have me run a Speed Test before he left.
 When I did run a speed test, I only received between 20-24mbps wirelessly, vs. the between 60-75mbps wirelessly I was told I am supposed to get. Wired, I am supposed to receive over 100mbps. My modem and router are only 10 feet away from my computer.
 I called and left a message for William Ward. I have left several messages for William Ward. My messages are always polite, with tinges of frustration. He has never called me back since our first conversation. Not once. I emailed Felix Hernandez to follow-up and his emails are intermittent and have gotten nothing done.
 I called Customer Service. They had me reset my modem and router, which I had already done. No difference. So, they schedule ANOTHER tech to come out on Easter Sunday, April 5th between 12-2pm.
 April 5th - The tech arrived during the scheduled window. He walked around, tightened a few things, had me run the speed test a few times. No change.
 April 7 - I called the Billing department to talk about the 'bait-and-switch' approach to their sales. I spoke with someone in ""Loyalty"" by the name of Russ. When I told him that I was given, twice, the quote of $29.99/1st year for their Internet service. He asked me if I got it in writing. When I told him not to try that approach, that I was told twice the same number, he put me on hold and then came back telling me that there is a promotional rate of that amount (DUH!) and he would apply it to my account.
 He told me that the price would then go to $66.95 after a year. I told him I was told it would go to $54.99 after a year. He told me he does not have that that it would go to $66.95.
 He then told me that the Blast! service would go to $12/mo after the 1 year at $5/mo. I told him I was NEVER told that the Blast service would increase. I emailed Felix Hernandez and asked him about the Blast service and a) that it is not giving me the performance he told me it would and b) that he never told me that it would go from $5/mo to $12/mo after one year.
 When he sent an email (which I still have), it still does not say that it would go to $12/mo after. In fact, his email does not say that the $29.99/mo is only good for one year. I asked him about that and he has not replied to this email as of this complaint filing.
 I did not want to go with Comcast in the first place, but in my area, they are literally the only game in town.
 I learned today that they are sending out another outside tech to check the lines. That is scheduled for tomorrow. They were not going to tell me that and told me I do not have to be home for that. I told them it would be nice to know so that I can test the speed while they are here. They didn't seem to think that was important.
 Their approach is appalling, inefficient and filled with lies and deception.
 Their customer service is trained to say, ""I promise"", ""Rest assured"", and ""It will happen"" and it doesn't.
 I have asked the question several times - Do I need the Blast! service if I am only getting up to 24mbps and I am supposed to get between 60-75mbps. No one wants me to deal with that, so no one is answering the question.
 I have had their service for 5 days; I have been dealing with them 12 days. I have been told and promised things all the way from Corporate Executive Customer Service (215) 286-1760. So, if I am dealing with them and they still cannot get a VERY SIMPLE internet installation done - and get quotes and billing correct, one can hopefully see why I am frustrated.
 I don't know what the FCC can do, but I figure this has to be reported.
 Thank you
 Mill Valley, CA

1295,"Additional Complaint concerning FCC Complaint Ticket No. 321995
 1. I was told by Comcast on June 9th, the FCC complaint had been received and my matter would be reviewed
 2. I received a message June 11th stating that they did not receive all communication from the FCC and asked for the original Marketing Materials
 3. I sent them a scanned copy clearly showing my name, address and offer.
 4. I received another e-mail from Comcast stating the following ""As of right now, this offer is not available to customers in California, this is only available to customers in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area.""
 5. I do not live or have I ever lived in these areas... I am in California, on the west coast and the legal US Mail from Comcast to my address at made an offer to me that was ""not available"".
 This is false advertising. .. apparently I was lured into another plan and was not aware of how wrong it was until I received my bill. I am being lied to by Comcast, now, directly from their corporate offices.

 Follow-up message by FCC on 6/12/2015 11:10:30 AM:
 This request was closed and merged into request #321995 ""Comcast Not Honoring Marketing M...""."
1296,"I have tried multiple times to resolve an issue with an advertisement I received from Comcast in postal mail, addressed to me, directly referring to my name in the advertisement to sell me another level of service.
 Comcast continued telling me multiple times that the advertisement was not found, but I was sold a plan under the impression that it was identical to the service in question.
 I was upset when I received my bill and tried to resolve the matter through multiple levels at Comcast. After my first complaint to the FCC, a corporate employee contacted me, in multiple communications with her she told me varying things that did not correspond to the offer sent to me. She told me first that the offers were only available in cities on the east coast .. After waiting another week, I was then told the offer expired in March.
 After looking again at the offer, in small print that I can only read with a magnifying glass, ""see reverse side for information, details and restrictions"". ....Yet... on the reverse side there is just more advertising about the offer in larger print with photos placed all over. It isn't until the 4th page at the bottom, again, in print so small I can barely make it out with a magnifying glass, it does say ""offer expires 5/17/15"" which is actually after the date I called Comcast to change my service. I called before the advertisement expired.
 I have been lied to multiple times, in my point of view, deliberately by Comcast. I see this as blatant ""Bait and Switch Fraud"". I have found many more complaints on-line about this very same subterfuge by Comcast to lure customers into more expensive plans by falsely advertising lower rates.
 This is my third complaint to the FCC. I am at this time in the process of cancelling my service with Comcast. When I do so, due to the time and anguish and being blatantly lied to after 10 years as a customer. I expect any billing to return to the monthly amount before I changed service.

1297,"I simply wanted to move services from one apartment to another and it took me more than 3 calls and 5 hours to get that done. Once the guy came home to install, they didn't even move services correctly. I had to call again to get my Internet working. After that I had to call again to get my Xfinity on Demand working. Then I had to go to the Xfinity store to change my cable box to get that to work. All this took more than 10 hours and several calls!
 And now, today, my credit card gets billed for 92.95 without even getting a bill! When I call xfinity again, I was told after moving services, I get a new account number and that was not added to my previous account/login. So I was transferred from the billing department to whoever to get this done. That guy took more than 30 minutes and could not even add my new account number to my existing account. He kept trying and asked me to lgoout and login several times and he couldnt do a simple thing like that. I would believe that if I have moved services, all these things happen in the background even without me having to do anything, So I am still stuck and cant even see my new account number and service address after I login to xfinity account. As a result I dont see my new bill and because my previous address was on auto pay, xfinity very happily just took the money from my credit card without sending me the bill. To make it worse, that guy on the phone said he will transfer me to the specialist team to resolve this and after waiting on the line for 15 minutes, a lady came on the phone and she was from the security department and said she doesnt handle service requests. Then why was I transferred there and why is Xfinity customer service so bad!! I want my money back! Is this the kind of customer service xfinity wants to provide?? I want someone from Xfinity to resolve this and also compensate me for this.

1298,"For over 2 years, I have been having issues with my internet connection. For the first year, I kept telling Comcast that their modem was defective, however, they kept doing patch fixes and blaming it on everything possible (even suggesting ripping open the walls of my new home to replace the cables) until finally replacing the modem.
 After a few months of working well, the internet issues have reappeared. I face regular speed drops and sometimes complete disconnection. Their DNS servers were down for hours and I had to resort to using Google's DNS servers to maintain my connectivity.
 I have been disconnected in the middle of important work meetings and calls and if I were to convert those into monetary losses, Comcast owes me well over my entire year's bill for their ""service"".
 I kindly request you to look into this utter disgrace of a ""service""

 With regular service disruption and complains for over 2 years, Comcast has done nothing to either fix their service or to compensate me in the bills.
 Moreover, I receive downright rude and threatening calls about service disruption.
 They call me at all odd hours and when I finally answered and told them ""This is not a convenient time"", their response was ""You answered the call""!
 How is this kind of obnoxious behavior acceptable?

1302,"I have had Internet and cable services through Comcast for about 4 months now and their services
 are awful. I don't know why I am still Paying for the Internet. On average, it goes out 5 times a week
 at random times. When I have called to complain and try to fix the problem, I get nothing but grief
 from them. When I finally talked to manager the last time i called, he said the solution I had been
 getting to reset my Internet was only temporary and that I would need a technician to come out. They
 say that I am responsible for the charges which I find to be outrageous as it is their problem. Why
 should I spend $150 - 200 to get a technician out here to fix this recurring problem. I think they just
 want to suck more money out of me."
1303,"I first opened an account with Comcast in June 2014, and I signed up for internet service (no TV or anything extra) at $34.99 a month. I've attached my first bill where it indicates the service discount I was receiving. In November of 2014, the service discount changed without warning, and my Comcast bill for the same exact service I'd already been receiving went up to $49.99 a month. I did not file a complaint at that time, because I've come to expect billing issues with Comcast. However, once again, in May 2015, I received a bill for $78.95, with a notice about a change in costs for TV, which should not have affected my price, because I do not want or need TV from Comcast, and my internet service has not changed since I signed up a year ago. I've attached my most recent bill as well.
 When I called Comcast to inquire about why my bill went up and if I could get it lowered, I was told after three months of paying $78.95, I could call and request another service discount back down to $49.99. I should only have to pay $34.99, which I signed up for because I could afford it and the service met my needs. Please help me resolve this issue.

1305,"I signed a 36 mo contract with Comcast Business to provide business internet service on 4/9/15 thru their 3rd party document company ""Docusign"". Within 1 day of signing, Comcast indicated they could not honor contract because it had an incorrect promotion code in it. They required me to re-sign a new contract at a higher rate with less benefits even though their own contract states that the signed document is a binding agreement on both parties. Additionally, they committed fraud by altering my original signature so that they could get out of the contract. All of this was emailed to me and I have this info available. I need them to honor the original contract and install service to my business!

1306,"On 4/30/2015 I called Comcast to let them know I was moving and gave the new address to the
 representative. He told me all was OK and I would get a call the next day. The next day 05/01/2015
 no one called so I called. I was told by a different rep my order was not processed yet and I will have
 to call back the next day. Then she stated she was sorry to call Monday because today is Friday and
 they are closed over the weekend. I then explained this is a small business account I use for work. I
 explained I work from home and am in need of urgent assistance. She stayed I must call Monday to
 be helped. I call Monday 05/04/2015 and was told my order to have my services moved was still not
 processed because the system Comcast use cannot find my address. I asked why was I not told this
 last week Thursday when I called. The rep stated she does not know but I have to wait for the original
 sales rep to come to work to be helped because she cannot change my address. I then asked for a
 supervisor and was told by the representative Ms.Neel she speaks for her supervisor and there was
 no one I could speak with. I again asked for a supervisor she stated she will call the sales team and
 ask them for a supervisor because they are the only people who can change my address. She then
 placed me on hold got back on the phone and said. A rep just told her my address was correct no
 need for a supervisor. I again requested a supervisor because we were now on the call a hour. Rep
 placed me on hold and hung up. I called back again and this time the representative who took the call
 transferred me to the original rep from 4/30/2015. He stated he was having some troubles with my
 address. Please give him 5 min and he will send me some info to sign with my new address modified.
 Those documents arrived an hour later. I spoke with several reps pleading for help because I needed
 my services at my new address so I can work. Each rep said they have no supervisor I can speak
 with. Each rep stated they will expedite my issue. No one called to have my services installed at my
 new address. A rep even went as far as to let me know to cancel my account I would need to pay
 1,900.00 but he had no clue how to transfer my services. 4 days I have been out of work waiting on
 Comcast to install services at my new address. I am currently being charged for service s I cannot
 use. As of now I still have no install date. I have been hung up on several times. I never thought I
 would have a problem transferring my service to a new address. Same complex just one building over
 which I told the reps. My bill is not being adj for days with no service. I sent in a eamil welcome letter
 from FPL showing I gave the correct address. The company I partner with to make a income now
 wants to terminate our agreement because I have not been able to work in four days and I could not
 give them a install date as to when I will have services and will work. I explained Comcast never gave
 me a install date but I have called several times asking for one. Its sad that Comcast has no manager
 available to assist customers. Its sad I have to pay for services I cannot use. Communication is a
 huge flaw with Comcast because according to reps they can only send emails and hope some will
 respond. The customer service I received was horrible. To add injury to insult I was told my contract
 has to be extended because I moved. That's unethical, I moved because my lease expired and I
 needed a larger space. I never asked Comcast for anything and I pay my bill. That's just down right
 crazy to extend my contract because I relocated but kept the same services. Then told my new early
 termination fee is 1,900.00 but no one can come install services at my new address. This is horrible
 and should not be allowed."
1307,"Called Comcast May 5th to set up new service, they said they would be sending a technician. So far so good:
 1st appointment: Tech tells me he can not connect the service and he will call supervisor to come and take a look
 2nd appointment: Supervisor comes to house and tells me that I need an ""MDU"" line. He says he will have someone call me to make this speacial intallation appointment.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call them: Said what happened and that supervisor was going to have someone call me to make appointment for the MDU line hook up but no one ever called me to make the appointment. They tell me not to worry that they will have someone come out to do it.
 3rd Appointment: Another Tech comes out and tells me again he can't connect it and he will call the supervisor.
 I get on the phone with the supervisor (Olaf is his name) and he says ""Oh it's you again? No one ever called you? Let me send the email again so they can call you"".
 NO ONE EVER CALLS ME
 I call again comacast and now ask to speak to a superviso, who apologizes for the trouble and makes an appointment to connect the MDU line hook up.
 4th Appointment: The guy shows up but has a problem entering my neighborhood gate and says he will be back in 1 hour.
 NEVER SHOWS UP.
 I call Comcast again and ask to speak to another Supervisor.
 He apologizes and tells me he will have someone call me to make an appointment for the MDU line.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call comcast again and make sure they have my right phone number (which I know they do because they called me many times to confirm the first appointment I had) and ask to again speak to a Supervisor.
 He tells me he is sorry, he will have someone call me.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call again, comcast says there is a long wait on the phone that I can choose to have comcast call me back and not loose my place in line. The machine says they will be calling me back in the next 6-10 minutes.
 NO ONE CALLS ME
 I call again and ask to speak to a supervisor who now tells me that my account is disconnected and that he needs to have tech set it up again before they can even talk about making the MDU line hook up connections.
 He puts me on wait while he contacts sale department.
 I'm on hold for 30 minutes until the call drops.
 I still don't have service and it has been over a month that they already charged and and have never connected or resolved anything.
 This is a disgrace of a company and customer service.
 I will forever discourage anyone from using comcast.

1308,"I contacted Comcast for service for a year and was asked for my SSN because they needed to pull by credit report. When I stated that I was not comfortable with giving my SSN over the phone, I was then told that they would not pull my credit report, but I had to pay a $50.00 holding fee because they did not know my credit history. The following day, I received notification that my credit report had been pulled by Comcast although I was told that it would not be. I immediately contacted them and inquired as to why I am being charged $50.00 if you pulled my credit report without my consent. I was told that I should not have been charged the $50.00, but it would take 30 days to refund my money and send me a check. I then stated that I was not interested in receiving a check, but wanted the money refunded to my credit card. The agent then told me that if I wanted to expedite the issue, I could call my credit card company and dispute the charge so that they could refund the payment faster. When I received my bill, the $50.00 fee had been corrected, along with many other ridiculous charges, but now I was being charged a $30.00 return check fee for a $50.00 fee I should not have been initially charged. What?! I again contacted Comcast in an attempt to have a $30.00 Return Check fee removed from my bill and was given a reference number indicating that it had been corrected. When I received my following bill, I saw that the fee had still not been corrected and called Comcast again trying to have this issue resolved, receiving another reference number, that indicated that this issue would be corrected. When I went to pay my bill three days later, I saw that the issue had not been resolved and again contacted Comcast. I told them that I needed this corrected and was told that the supervisor had to review this because I had already received previous credits and would need to wait another billing cycle. I told the agent that I would not be paying the $30.00 fee as I had two reference numbers indicating that it would be corrected and those credits were for erroneous charges. I still have not been able to get this matter resolved as the agent hung up the phone on me. I would like this matter to be resolved, but it has been to no avail. Getting service from this company was the biggest mistake I could have made. Only the Lord knows what will happen at the end of the year.

1310,"Since October 1, 2013, Comcast has been charging consumers in Mobile, Alabama additional money for every 50 gb of traffic over an artificially mandated 300gb traffic limit. They have been conducting this ""test market"" of tiered pricing in other areas as well. (See https://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-Where-will-these-plans-be-launched). Complainant argues that Comcast should treat all of its customers across the nation equally. Whereas in other markets, no traffic limitation is currently being applied, Complainant and all others in the ""test markets"" have been charged additional money for internet traffic above and beyond an artificially set limit of 300gb, as if the data were a tangible utility such as water that were going to run out. Comcast has provided no rationale for the 300gb/month limitation other than congestion, and has provided consumers no evidence that such congestion actually exists.
 The arguments here are manifold, so I will address them separately:
 1. Comcast's entire customer base should be treated equally, and offered the same quality and pricing model of service unilaterally, other than acceptable market-based pricing dictated by free-market competition (where such exists).
 2. Comcast's argument for enacting this trial of traffic caps is that of network congestion and cost of last-mile provision. However, during the pendency of this ""test market"" trial, Comcast has contradicted such claims by opening up the WiFi routers of their individual customers for access to ALL Comcast customers, which implies that there is no necessary limitation to per-user traffic that would necessitate the 300gb/month limitation. Charging the consumer extra for exceeding a traffic limit while ignoring the traffic used by surrounding customers through that individual's internet connection is a contradiction that suggests there truly is no congestion issue.
 3. If Comcast is going to conduct ""test market"" trials such as these, Comcast should have to fully disclose the terms of such trials, including the full scope and end date of these trial data programs.
 4. As Comcast has now conducted these ""test market"" trials in the Mobile, Alabama area for 21 months, it would seem that Comcast has had ample time to assess the traffic needs of the test market areas and obtain any data they require for these test market trials, at the expense of their customers who have been forced to pay extra for additional traffic.
 5. On multiple occasions, via telephone and Comcast's internet support chat, Complainant has been told that this ""test market"" tiered pricing was due to expire. Most recently, Comcast's support representative informed Complainant that the 300gb/month limitation was being changed within two weeks. The approximate date of this change has come and gone, and to date, customers in the Mobile, Alabama area are still subject to the ""test market"" per-use pricing structure. Complainant can provide a text log of this support chat session upon request.
 6. By way of implication due to Comcast's inherent business interests in cable television content provision, Complainant asserts that the 300gb/month and $10.00 for each additional 50gb plan that Comcast has enacted on ""test market"" consumers exists solely to prevent its internet users from
 ""cutting the cord"" - i.e. consuming video content via internet streaming services rather than Comcast's own cable television service. This artificial limitation effectively prohibits consumers from using the internet as they see fit and discriminates against the innovative video streaming services that now dominate American internet usage. As the recent Title II reclassification now places limitations on ISPs re: discriminatory blocking and throttling of internet traffic, Complainant asserts that Comcast's test market limitation of 300gb/month of traffic before additional charges is a de facto method of discriminating against streaming video service traffic on their network.
 6a. Moreover, Complainant asserts that the monitoring of customer traffic for the purposes of charging additional money is invasive and violates the privacy rules set forth in the recent Title II reclassification and rules.
 6b. Worse, Complainant asserts that the 300gb/month limitation before additional pricing unfairly burdens existing markets who provide services via the internet. For instance, Microsoft offers downloadable games for its Xbox One gaming console which are typically 30-50gb in size. By placing a 300gb/month limitation on consumer traffic, Comcast is effectively stifling the innovation of this growing digital market. As the FCC's intention is to ensure that innovative new markets on the internet are not interfered with by the interests of Internet Service Providers, Complainant asserts that such artificial traffic limitations should be done away with. Comcast is free to charge what the market dictates for such last-mile provision of internet service, however, this service should essentially be a ""dumb pipe"" wherein the consumer may use it as they see fit, for the legal purposes they see fit, without Comcast's policies keeping emerging markets from further expansion.
 I look forward to discussing this matter further.

 A representative from Comcast contacted me today by phone. He essentially had no answers to give as to how long the ""test market"" would run, when they would have enough data from the ""test market"" to roll it out nationwide, etc. He basically told me that this was the way things were going (in reference to tiered per-use pricing based on your traffic), and then tried to blame net neutrality for it being this way. He even brought up that this pricing was better than their old policy of terminating a customer's service if they went over 250gb of traffic in a month, as if that policy were any less inane and discriminatory than the current one. He could not answer questions about congestion, or the contradiction between them claiming congestion exists and opening up everyone's WiFi router to all Comcast customers. Basically, this phone call from their representative went exactly the same way every call I have had with them on this matter has gone. They said they would log the complaint and that my feedback was important to them, without actually changing anything or offering any solutions.
 Therefore, my complaint stands. I would appreciate some comment by the FCC on this matter, and would welcome a discussion if the need arises. I do not feel that, as Comcast's representative told me, this is just ""the way things are going"". Or at least, it shouldn't be, if emerging digital content markets are going to survive.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/16/2015 11:07:19 AM:
 So basically, this entire complaint system just gives Comcast the ability to give their customers the same excuses as before... and continue the same anti-consumer practices as before. Comcast's response to me by phone was not acceptable, as I previously stated. I sincerely doubt that their written response will be much different."
1311,"As a newly married couple, my wife and I moved into our own place and of course started looking for internet providers. Comcast was of course the cheapest at a ""promotional"" 3 month package price at $35 a month. We went with it and after three months, the price jumped $15 a month more! Called and got another ""promotional"" price for $45. Comcast tried to get me to go with a package deal for internet, phone and cable multiple times throughout my time as their customer. I have no need for any service except internet as I didn't even have a TV until recently which we still only use netflix/hulu. Then there was no more ""promotional"" prices available and we had to stick with the internet only package at $55. It eventually reached $65 for the same internet package because all of their packages received a ""boost in speed"". The price was going to sky rocket, so I went in to talk to them. It was either internet for $65 or a cable + internet package with a faster internet speed for $55. Of course, we took the package for the price and are on this once again ""promotional"" package deal that will only last x amount of months. I fear the price will just continue to rise over time and have not heard of any other internet provider pulling this on their customers. I have had this package for quite a few months now and still have the cable equipment in the box it came in. I fear my story will continue for years and become a repeat of the first story listed in the reference article below. Please help us!

1312,"In an apartment complex the quality of internet goes down because of use by many people at the same time. I pay an extra $12 per month for extra speed and the quality is still the same as not having the extra fee. Comcast will take my money for the upgrade but cannot follow through on faster internet.

1313,"I run a small WISP in rural Mokelumne Hill. CA. I get my back haul from a Comcast leased fiber run to Fremont, CA. Where it terminates at a Hurricane Electric data center. I was originally paying Comcast about $1500 a month for this agreement. We had agreed in a contract that the payments would be around $1300 a month, and they conveniently forgot to mention that there would be another $200 in USF taxes added on to that total. The service I was receiving was at a rate of 100 mbps. After about a year I called up my account rep at Comcast (Mike Jones) and asked if there was anything I could do to renegotiate the price of the contract as this was by far my largest expense and I was struggling to make the payments. I mentioned the fact that I thought the USF Tax shouldn't be applied in this case based on some research that I had done on the parameters of the tax. That was when Mike Jones from Comcast told me ""you know what, you're right it shouldn't be applied. We've been fighting the decision to apply the tax on accounts such as yours, and it was just overturned very recently. The only catch is that we can only apply it new accounts. So If you wanted to upgrade to say 200mbps. We could treat it as a new contract and that way we would avoid having to charge you the USF tax. So because you wouldn't have that extra burden and upgrade to 200mbps would cost an additional $400 a month but in reality you will only be paying an additional $200 more then what you are already paying today. "" Double the speed for only an additional $200 sounded like a good deal so I agreed, even though I was already paying out more then I could afford. I figured with the additional bandwidth I would be able to bring in more business and I would be lowering my overall cost per/mbps. However, when the bill came for the first month I was shocked to see that not only was the USF fee still on the bill, but now that the base amount was higher I was paying almost $300 in USF taxes. I tried contacting Mike Jones, who seems to have disappeared off the face of the planet and anytime I try to call customer service I just get the run around. So I am done trying to track down imaginary people. I want the service and all additional incurred charges to be reverted back to the original agreement. I would have never agreed to an upgrade had I known that this is what it would cost. I was assured by a Comcast rep that I would not be paying these additional fees, and I feel that this is a case of false advertisement.

1314,"Comcast is blocking the streaming services of HBO to playstation4 users. Can Comcast discriminate
 which platforms can and cannot receive content? It seems they should have to allow all platforms to
 receive the same content and not choose which get access."
1315,"Over the course of 2 weeks, I have constantly complained to Comcast about my reduce speeds. I have moved the modem within several rooms within my apartment, change the channels, and rebooted the systems on multiple occasions but have been receiving sub par internet connections and speeds. The internet connection that I am currently paying for is 100Mbs from Comcast. What i am currently receiving is 30 - 50 Mbs half the speeds that I have been paying for. This is a major issues as i have reported this on multiple times.
 My second issues is as of right now, I am stuck within a monopolized area as most people are. In most areas there is only one broadband provider. So for me it is a situation where you have to deal with the bad things that you are dealing with now or pay higher cost for wireless service provider for limited speeds and internet connection. As a IT professional this is stifling to my profession. I should be able to have options for who i use and not deal with a company if they have bad performance. And because of my lack of options I am forces to deal with the situation.

1318,"Hello! I have been a long time comcast customer for both personal and business. I currently have internet, voice, television, and home security services with Comcast. They are the only cable company authorized to operate in my City. They are also the only company that offers any semblance of high speed internet access. They essentially have a monopoly on this area.
 Currently Comcast has a usage limit of 300GB per month for personal accounts and $10 per 50GB of data usage over that limit. This is only limited to certain comcast markets and only to personal accounts. I have asked repeatedly what my options are for getting away from the limit and been advised that the only way to do that is to get a business account. A business account assigned to a residential address could only serve internet and voice, not the rest of my services. Not only would services be charged at a higher rate, but would also be two bills to pay each month. This month I was hit with an additional $70 fee on my internet service.
 It's alsmost as if we are leasing services from comcast instead of purhcasing services, similar to a vehichle lease where you're charged if you go over. Comcast also cannot backup the numbers they are using to show what services these are used for or what devices are using them.
 Very frustrating and would like to see the 300GB limit removed from personal accounts.

1320,"My internet service is down since last night (06/24) and upon calling Comcast Customer Service, I was told the earliest appointment for a technician to come and fix is 07/01, I thought ""wow"" what great customer service, so decided to walk into the closest Comcast service center to speak with the onsite Manager, however the outstanding service I receive is a suggestion from the employee named ""Russell"" to sit in the Comcast Service Center till 07/01 as he can extend absolutely no help if the system says the earliest appointment is 01 July. He would not give his employee code or last name, upon insisting upon speaking to his Manager, got to know the Manager is on vacation, so he scribbles the Manager's incorrect email address.
 Worst part is the service being down and on top of it the representative's horrible attitude, probably this is how Comcast educates representatives.
 Not giving up I came back home and called Customer Service again and was told a technician will be at my home between 12 PM - 4 PM today (06/25) and the ticket reference to the call is CR476135695 by a representative named RJ, however when I called Comcast automated service at 12:30 PM EST just to make sure things are in order, the appointment got rescheduled again to 01 July 2015. This is horrible service, I was not only misguided but was lied, it is very poor service.
 I went back to the East Windsor, NJ Comcast office and waited outside the building to speak to a comcast technician, however was told there is nothing much one can do considering an assignment has to be made. I did everything within my boundary to resolve but the pathetic ways of comcast functioning and poor customer just limited my ability, with deep sadness, I am lodging this complaint.

 Comcast's response was pleasing and I am happy with the result. Thank you again."
1323,"I am writing today to tell you that I plan on filing a complaint against Comcast with the BBB. I ordered
 Comcast internet at the end of January using the self install option. I bought my own router which was
 listed on the approved equipment list. The last Saturday in January the cords & booklet came in the
 mail. I was unable to connect to the internet. So I called into the customer service number & was told
 a tech could come to my house & do some work on the outside wires & that would solve the problem.
 The tech came out on a Monday afternoon & when I tried to connect to the internet after work I was
 again unable to. I called customer service a few days later & the guy told me it had to be my
 equipment. Like I told him, there's no way possible since my equipment was on the list & it was
 bought brand new. I was told he would send me a router free of charge & I should receive it within a
 week. Well, I never received it. I was still unable to connect to the internet towards the end of
 February so I called in to cancel my service. I was told it would be disconnected as of the day I called
 & I would receive a confirmation email. I never received the email so I called customer service & as I
 was waiting heard that I had a balance of $30.10. Once I got on the phone I brought up the fact I
 never received a confirmation email & I shouldn't have a balance since I never used the service. I
 was told my service wouldn't actually be turned off until March 13th when a tech would come out, do
 something with the outside wires, & my equipment was returned. After that my balance would be $0
 since I cancelled my service within 30 days. I told the customer service rep that I had bought my own
 equipment so I had nothing to return & I wouldn't be paying for the tech to come out. Was reassured
 everything would be taken care of. This was at the beginning of March. In early
 April I received a letter from CCS saying that I had a balance with you guys for $30.10. It says on the
 letter that my start date was 1/1/15 & my disconnect date was 2/23/15, which is not correct. I called
 customer service & said I'm not paying for services I didn't use, this is affecting my credit, & I want it
 taken care of. I was told that they were submitting my account to a supervisor for approval to have a
 $0 balance. Then I would receive a call from Comcast & a letter in the mail within 7 days stating that I
 didn't owe anything. Comcast was also supposed to report the $0 balance to CCS. This was mid
 April. Till this day have NOT gotten a follow up phone call or email. Well imagine my surprise when I
 got a phone call today from CCS saying I still owe $30.10. I called customer service but when I put in
 my account phone number it says I have prepaid services. I don't know what that is but I shouldn't
 have ANY Comcast services. I was waiting to talk to someone for over 12 minutes. I finally hung up &
 went through the prompts as if I was a new customer. I told the representative that I had
 disconnected my services but I wanted to see why there was a balance. Her reply? Sorry, but if you
 disconnected then there's nothing I can do for you. Really?!? I told her I wanted to speak to a
 supervisor so she placed me on hold & then hung up. My questions are: 1) Why didn't they submit my
 account for a $0 balance to a supervisor back in February when I disconnected my service like they
 said they would? 2) Why am I being told things are being taken care when they really aren't? 3) Why
 should I have to pay for services that I NEVER used? This has to do with more than $30.10. This has
 to do with the fact Comcast has the WORST customer service I've ever dealt with in my life & my
 credit is being messed up because I'm being charged for something I didn't use. That right there is a
 complete scam."
1324,"Hello,
 I have had issues since day 1 with Comcast. I originally signed up in April 2014 with Comcast because I received a promotional ad in the mail for a Double Play Package of high speed internet at 105 mbps and Cable for $99.99 for 24 months as well as a prepaid card up to $200 when signing up. I called to activate this deal (it was not expired). A month later I received my bill and realized the representative had signed me up for something completely different. I was given the Starter Package of internet speed of 25 mbps and 140 cable channels for $79.99 for 12 months. This was not what I asked for. I was speaking with a different representative about this issue, and she corrected the problem (so I thought) and given me 12 months of the Double Play Package of high speed internet at 105 mbps and Cable for $79.99 and after that it would be $99.99 for year two. She also threw in HBO and Showtime free for 12 months.
 April of this year I had moved to Montgomery, IL and ever since my move I have been experiencing problems again with Comcast. I requested a service transfer April 27th and a technician was to come April 30th. My services stopped of course but my move transfer was never submitted come to find out after speaking with a second representative. She scheduled a technician to come out on May 5th between 8 – 12. I was not home but my father was to let the technician hook everything up. Come to realize later our door bell was broken and no one heard them come. I understand this is not Comcast fault however trying to reschedule another visit ASAP was very difficult. I called on May 5th to reschedule another visit and the soonest available date was May 9th. I work from home and this was unacceptable so I called again to try to speak with someone who can schedule me sooner. Same day, May 5th I called back 5 minutes later I speak with someone and they say the soonest available date is May 7th,. I don’t understand how the dates could change so quickly. I set up the tech visit for May 7th. For this inconvenience I spoke with someone and they were going to waive the tech visit and installation charges. I was not home for the installation, but my father was. After coming home I noticed our cable was freezing every 5 seconds. I tried calling tech support and all they tried to do was reset the system and that did not work. I had to travel for work for a few weeks so I was not home to try to correct the problem and my boyfriend was experiencing the cable freezing and slow internet speeds and he was not able to speak with anyone because it was in my name.
 I returned home last week and now I am trying to correct many problems. However, every time I do I cannot get a hold of someone who cares. Last week I used the online chat and I spoke to someone about my billing concerns. I saw on my bill for May 7-June 6 that the installation fee was waived however the tech visit was not. The person I was chatting with said they were unable to waive the tech visit however he can give me a promotional rate for my HD DVR for $9.99, when I wanted to print the conversation the chat ended abruptly.
 I again chatted with a representative named Rhollen earlier this week about the same issues and they were of no assistance at all. I asked how come my package went up to $109.99 and they said because the promotional rate expired and I believed at that time it was $79.99 for 2 years (after looking over my paperwork after speaking with someone about the incorrect package I received when I first signed up it was $79.99 for year 1 and $99.99 for year 2). She then began to tell me that I was only getting 25 mbps which is not what I agreed to, I signed up for 105 mbps (I have the print out of the conversation see attached). I had to end the conversation, but later I signed back on and talked to a different representative named Charmaine.
 Charmaine first explains that I had a promotional rate of $79.99 for year 1 and it goes up to $99.99 for year 2. I asked well how come I am paying $109.99, she then apologized and said the $99.99 rate was incorrect and $109.99 is correct rate. How come her answer changed? I then asked what speed I am getting and she said 105 mbps. I told her the other person told me 25 mbps and she said that is not correct and if I would like to submit a complaint. I said yes and I would like to submit a complaint about you as well for giving me different year 2 rate prices. (I have a print out of the conversation see attached).
 Later that Monday I called Comcast customer resolution department and the first gal I spoke I requested to speak with a supervisor. She began asking what my issue was and I told her that I was given two different rate prices and two different speed ratings. She told me what year 1 was for $79.99 and year two it increased to $109.99 and that I am paying for 50 mbps internet package. I am extremely confused now I’m being told I am getting 3 different internet speeds??? She said she submitted a call back request and I was to expect a call within 30 minutes.
 2 hours later I received no call, so I called back Comcast customer resolution department once more. I spoke with a different gal and demanded I talk to a supervisor, she also wanted to know what my issue was and I told her, she then put me on hold for 10 minutes and hung up on me.
 I called back a 3rd time and spoke with Mark, again I demanded to talk to a supervisor, told him my issue and he said no call back requests were ever entered on my account and said he would look for his supervisor. He put me on hold for 5 minutes and answered telling me that he was transferring me to his supervisor. I was on hold for 15 minutes and guess what, I got hung up on AGAIN.
 4th time I called back very upset and I spoke with Jay and he said there were no available supervisors and that he submitted a call back request, he also said there were no call back requests listed on my account. I failed to believe that Jay would submit a call back request either. Jay said he would have his supervisor call me within 48 hours (this was Monday at 7:45 pm). It is now Thursday 9 am and it has been over 60 hours so I fail to believe that once again the Customer Resolution department would resolve my issue. I am desperately close to ending my service with Comcast if I do not get my issues resolved ASAP.
 Summary of my issues:
 • I signed up for a 24 month contract of Double Play Package (105mpbs and Cable). It was agreed that I would pay $79.99 for the first year for the inconvenience and $99.99 year two. I am not getting that promotional rate and that is a problem. (See Promotional Ad attached of what I originally wanted).
 • I also never received my promotional prepaid card when signing up (because they signed me up for something else) not my fault. I called a representative about this issue several times and their answer was to make 3 on time payments and a prepaid card will arrive to your address. I called back after 4 months and they said the deal expired and were of no assistance. (See Promo prepaid card attached).
 • I am receiving three different responses of what internet speed I am currently getting (25, 50 or 105 mbps). If I am getting 25 or 50 but paying for 105 then I want Comcast to reimburse me!!!!

1325,"Was supposed to have internet service starting 3/16/15. Here we are with still no service. My husband has missed 3 1/2 days of work due to several times on the phone with supervisors and having techs sent out with no work to be completed. This has been the most absolute joke. Customer service is rude and no help. We are at our wits end. Never had such poor customer service in my life and that is the industry I have been in for 20yrs. Everything we are promised doesn't happen with being told we will receive a call back from a high level which has still not happened.

1328,"We moved to our current home last June 2014, our Internet was constantly slow, always buffering & sometime would just freeze to where we had to reboot our modem. We called Comcast multiple times & had 2 different tech's sent out. One of those times, we were charged around 45 dollars. They told us every time that they fixed the problem & then would try to usher us off the phone as immediately as possible. The problem was never fixed. Every time I use the Internet on my computer, I have to turn it off & then turn it back on to receive signal. We cannot watch Netflix because it buffers approximately every minute or two & the WiFi on our phones constantly has to be turned off & on to get it to work. Even our regular comcast tv service is messed up & were told by a technician that the OnDemand service was a ""gift"" they gave customers that we do not pay for & if it does not work (ours never does) we should just be grateful they offer it. We were told we could request another tech come to check the problem but that they do not see one & it would be at our cost again.

We're already paying over $100 a month just to have Comcast's ""FAST INTERNET"". Sure it's ""fast"", but you can't even use it if you have a 300 GB DATA CAP. I live in a family of 5. My dad, mom, little sister and little brother. We all watch online movies and videos all the time. My little brother and I are the gamers here. An update of HALO on my Xbox ONE was 19 GB yesterday!! 19 GB!! And they still want to impose this so called trial of 300 GB data cap??!! It has only been like 2 weeks and we're very near the 300 GB. They want to charge us more for using something we've already paid for! It is absolutely not fair. The only internet I can get in my area are Comcast, AT&T or (maybe) Clear. AT&T is too slow for us for our area, but faster than Clear. Clear is just too slow for us. Comcast is the only one with a ""fast"" internet. So there's not much of a choice. Please fix this bullcrap of a company. We have Google Fiber coming, but we're not even sure if they're coming to my area of Morrow, GA. They're charging us more to just make more money. I can't stream Netflix or download games or anything because of this dumb data cap. We're going to constantly go over the 300 GB limit and they're going to keep saying it's a innovation and it's a market trial. Yeah a market trial that been going on for over 2 years with no happy customers unless they're the kind that doesn't have to download a 19 GB game update at one time or MORE than once with XBOX/PS4 DIGITAL GAMES BEING OVER 50 GB TO DOWNLOAD EACH! That's not even including their usually huge updates. Please please fix this already. It's unfair for consumers and I'm pretty sure some of you guys have to deal with it.

 You really, really, really need to fix the lack of competition in the cable space. Striking down the merger was beyond awesome, but having internet access and not having to drag my kids into work at 2am because I can't connect from home would be almost as awesome.

1333,"My address is the first house on a street in the Comcast service area. I have been told that my house is serviceable and also not serviceable - they have sent a contractor out to set up cable, but he told me he could not do it and would have someone run a line. After that, I receive multiple calls telling me that I'm not serviceable.
 Comcast originally told me it would cost me $14,000 to run the cable to my property. My house is the first on a road that contains another 12 addresses in the half mile beyond my house - hardly remote. The two lots on the corners are large, however, so my house is a little ways down the road - less than a quarter of a mile (probably 200 yards). When quoting me the price, Comcast does not take into consideration that running this line to my house will give them much closer access to the rest of the properties on my street - both houses that have been there for years, and lots under active development. They also will not provide any documentation to back up their pricing.
 Upon repeated calls, Comcast continues to ignore my requests for more accurate quotes or information. I have been passed around from contact to contact, and repeatedly told conflicting information. I have their agreement with the county, and between the claim that 1400 feet of cable must be run and the criteria for determining when and where cables can be run, I feel they are in violation of their county agreement.
 Internet is of the utmost importance to me, and I have indicated as such - they still are unwilling to broach the subject, even when I pass a comcast box at the corner of my street!
 They want to merge themselves with ANOTHER company that has documented dismal customer service? Their customer service and desire to take care of willing customers is abysmal.

 Upon further communication with Comcast, they now claim:
 We would need to build 1368' underground mainline and place a pedestal 180' from your home. The cost to you is $6,316.53. This would have to be paid upfront before we will start the process which then takes 60-90 days depending on our existing work load.
 According to them, them, the total cost of the job is $9,923.84. I asked how they calculated the portion I was due, and they said ""We will spend $3,607.31 on a customer’s extension.""
 Looking at the Comcast contract with Frederick county (attached), and it states (page 35, 14.1 (D)) that:
 ""the Grantee shall pay an amount equal to the total cost of construction [$9,923.84] divided by the actual footage to be constructed [1368 ft] times the number of actual dwelling units passed by the new construction [assuming 1 here, me] times 211 feet.""
 That math would be (($9,923.84)/1368))*(1)*(211) = $1,531.
 Additionally, per their contract with the county, I would not need to pay it up front, but 50% before construction and 50% before installation."

 Give me my credit which i deserve ,i am not looking for any discount or extra compensation.Just give me my credit on the bill and leave me alone.You guys are not worth talking anymore.My services are already downgraded and i am not paying a penny out of my pocket for the extra charge i have on my bill.

 I also just realized they are also charging me another $10/month for an ""additional outlet converter""
 which I specifically gave to the technician to return, and he stated that fee would be removed the
 following month."
1342,"Three months ago my bill was increased by over 50%. I contacted chat support about this. The
 representative with whom I was connected was extremely rude and condescending. The support
 representative insisted that the rate I had was a promotional rate and that the promotion had run out.
 I told him that at no point was I ever informed that the rate I had was promotional and that it would
 increase by 50% withoutwarning; however, he was completely unsympathetic and uncaring.
 Finally after about an hour of arguing with him he agreed to give me another ""promotional"" rate. He
 insisted that I would receive an email with details about it, and most importantly, the end date of this
 promotion. No email ever came. He also claimed that I could visit http://www.xfinity.com/upgradecenter/
 customer-deals to see if better rates were available there. Every single time I have visited that
 page in the past three months I receive an almost blank page that states ""We are unable to process
 your request at this time. Please try again later.""
 Eventually he transfers me to someone else because the new promotional rate only takes effect in
 the future, it won't affect the 50% extra charges that had already occurred without any forewarning to
 me. That new representative assures me that the non-promotional rate, of which I had never agreed
 to, would be credited on next month's bill. I would only need to pay the charges for the new
 promotional rate and that a credit would appear on my next bill for the overcharge.
 I pay what the representative tells me to pay, and await the next bill to be credited. The next bill
 comes, and there are no credits at all. I am still being overcharged.
 I once again contact billing support because of this. This representative tells me that the credits are
 still being processed and will now show up on next month's bill. She gives me the small amount to
 pay post-credit and assures me that next months bill it correct.
 The amount she told me is paid and I now have this month's bill. Still no credits. Not a single thing
 has been adjusted on my bill. My bill and account online tells me I am past due and that I owe over
 $100 for a month of basic internet service.
 This is absolutely unacceptable. Every single representative I have spoken with for the past 3
 months has either been unable or unwilling to correct any of the issues I have raised. What I need
 now is someone competent from Comcast, who has the authority and capability to resolve my issues,
 to contact me immediately. I will pay nothing more to Comcast until this is resolved 100%.
 This is not an isolated incident. Every few months I get overcharged, whether through a flat out 50%
 to 100% price increase or by mysterious ""truck roll"" and ""install fees"" that no representative can
 explain how they got there. At least then those issues tend to be resolved in a single call. Here, it
 has been 3 months with nothing but empty promises.
 Not a single other service with which I do business increases my bills with no notification to me in
 advance nor explanation. Every other legitimate business explains that my rate will go up in a future
 bill, and at that point I am given a chance to either contest the charges or discontinue doing business
 with them. As far as I can tell, Comcast arbitrarily changes my rate and adds fees in the hopes that I
 will not notice and sign up for automatic billing. This is unacceptable. I will do no further business
 with Comcast until this is resolved."
1343,"I just hooked up internet outside Charleston, South Carolina, after moving from Austin, TX. I work as a lead software engineer at an established software company in Austin. All our environment is based out of Amazon, and in order to do work I frequently have to connect to machines, download various items, work on them, and place them back in a repository for the machines to pick up. When I called Comcast to set up service (the only provider in my area which would provide a useful enough speed to allow me to do my job), the representative assured me that there were no data caps on my connection and there were no overage charges. After being here a whopping 4 days, I learned that was not the case at all, and am being forced to limit myself to 300GB a month, as that is some arbitrary limit they have set. One database backup pulled down off of one of our servers can be about 100GB, so I will quickly have to make a choice as to whether or not performing my job is worth the $20 it will cost me to do something which is freely available in the rest of the country. The only reason I found this out was not due to their representatives, but logging in online to get emailed bills instead of paper ones. It's a sad state of affairs, and bandwidth is (nearly) free to the company, but charged via usage based-billing for no reason at all, other than a money grab.

1345,"In March 2014, I signed up as a new customer with Comcast. In April/a few weeks later, I switched to just broadband service as I didn't own a TV. I ordered the package with up to 25 Mbps download speed.
 On August 5, 2014, I received an email from Comcast announcing that they've increased/doubled my speed on my ""Performance"" internet package up to 50 Mbps download speed.
 Today I contacted Comcast about the poor speeds and billing for such. The tech department said that my Performance package for my area is throttled to max 25 Mbps for downloads. I noted to him what the Comcast website advertises to me specifically--that is, after logging in, the offers that are available to me, their existing customer. It clearly offers 50 Mbps downloads in the Performance internet package. Customer service refuses to honor that speed and cannot show me any literature regarding what they consider to the offers available to me/my area as they are different than on the personalized website.
 I want compensation/rebate for not receiving the higher performance as promised.

1347,"Following months of incredible diligence and investigation I took items one by one and eliminated each component factor to find the root cause of poor quality audio communication (interference). It was narrowed down to being dropped off the internet frequently (availability).
 Taking the time to focus on the issue until it got resolved has used up about a 40 hour week in the past 7 days. This communications business issue has to be corrected. The corporate numbing of megalopoly is absurd.
 The inability to conduct my business properly is a huge embarrassment, expensive and a nuisance. I expect to get to the bottom of the problem and get it resolved. However it does not mean things won't be disrupted and repeat the same harassing problems; will repeat itself. I am repeating myself for emphasis.
 These practices of intermittent disconnects have to end. Thus I am voicing my complaint to you now to put a lid on this ridiculous method of miserable business practices. We are still the land of the free USA.
 Still for now, remember that, for your children's future will be here. Lies cannot ever ever ever overcome the truth. It is hardwired into the neural system and no amount of pharmaceuticals will blur it without a host of side effects that will kill the body.
 I'm just saying, the more problems are cleared up now, the fewer there will be for the young to inherit. Let a competitive business model reign in the USA FCC!

I have called everday since them (4 - 5 times daily if not more) and am being told there is an outage that has affected my service with a time of a few hours when it should be restored. They have missed every deadline. I reach a rep yesterday who said they were working on a wiring problem. As of today the problem is still unresolved with not apparent timeline for this to be fixed. My work requires that I have internet access at home in the evenings and weekends. This has been a major problem with no end in sight.

1350,"I HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER OF COMCAST FOR APPROX A YEAR & HALF. WE HAVE THE EXTREME 105 INTERNET, SINCE THE BEGINNING, NOV. 2013, WE SUPPLIED OUR OWN MODEM( COMCAST REPS TOLD US THE MODEL TO PURCHASE). A COMCAST REP CAME OUT AND SET UP THE INTERNET & MODEM, REGISTERED THE MODEM WITH COMCAST. WE RECENTLY HAD TO HAVE THEM COME OUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH OUR INTERNET DROPPING & LOSING SIGNAL. UPON DOING SO, THE TECH NOTICED THAT THE MODEM THEY HAD ON FILE & THE ONE WE HAVE ARE DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBERS, WHICH WAS PART OF THE INTERNET ISSUE. MOREOVER, THE SERIAL NUMBER THE TECH ORIGINALLY PUT IN THE SYSTEM IS FOR A COMPANY OWNED MODEM, ONE THAT WOULD BE CHARGING US 8.00-10.00 EXTRA A MONTH ON OUR BILL. THE CHARGE SHOWS IT IS FOR A WIRELESS INTERNET GATEWAY. WE WERE TOLD THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE THAT IS MANDATORY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXTREME 105. THE TECH WHO MOST RECENTLY CAME OUT, EXPLAINED NO, THIS IS FOR A MODEM RENTAL. INFORMING US THAT THE ORIGINAL TECH SET UP THE MODEM INCORRECTLY, WHICH IN TURN HAS COST US ADDITIONAL MONEY EVERY MONTH ON OUR BILL. THE TECH CONTINUED TO INFORM US THAT EVERYTIME WE WOULD INQUIRE ABOUT THIS, THE REPS WOULD TELL US IT IS A MANDATORY CHARGE. I CALLED AND SPOKE WITH CUST CARE TO TRY TO GET THE ISSUE RESOLVED BC IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THEY SET UP THE MODEM INCORRECTLY. I WAS TOLD IT HAS BEEN FIXED BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREDIT THE ACCT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THEIR ERROR.
 I SHOULD BE CREDITED BACK THE 8-10.00 A MONTH THAT I HAVE BEEN CHARGED SINCE NOV 2013 DUE TO THEIR ERROR AND THE FACT THAT THE REP HAD MY MODEM INCORRECT AND PUT A COMPANY OWNED MODEM ON THE ACCT. THE CUST CARE REP SAID I SHOULD HAVE CALLED TO DISPUTE IT, THE ONE TIME I CALLED TO QUESTION IT, I WAS TOLD IT WAS A MANDATORY CHARGE DUE TO US HAVING THE EXTREME 105. NOONE EVER SAID IT WAS A MODEM RENTAL CHARGE, THE BILL DOES NOT SHOW IT IS A MODEM RENTAL CHARGE. IT SAYS WIRELESS GATEWAY. COMCAST SYSTEM SHOWS I HAVE A RENTAL MODEM, SO WITHOUT ANYONE PROPERLY DISCLOSING THE REAL REASON FOR THE CHARGE, HOW WOULD ONE DISPUTE THAT. COMCAST JUST HOPES & PRAYS THAT YOU DO NOT CATCH ON, & IF YOU DO, LIKE I DID, THEN THEY TELL YOU OH WELL, IT IS TOO LATE TO DISPUTE THE CHARGES. SO SORRY YOU WERE OVERCHARGED, WE WILL FIX IT NOW. SO THEY GOT 18 MONTHS EXTRA OUT OF ME, HOW MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE THE EMBEZZLED MONEY FROM AND FOR HOW LONG?! LET US KEEP IN MIND, I WAS ONLY REQUESTING CREDIT FOR THE OVERAGE IN THE MODEM CHARGE. I NEVER EVEN GOT TO THE POINT OF GETTING A CREDIT FOR ISSUES WITH THE INTERNET DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE REP HAD THE WRONG MODEM LISTEN ON MY ACCT.
 SO, LETS SAY I CALLED IN AGAIN TO DISPUTE IT AND THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME, ITS A MANDATORY CHARGE, I WOULD HAVE HUNG UP, AND PAID THE BILL. HAD A REP ONCE MENTIONED IT WAS FOR MODEM RENTAL, I WOULD HAVE THEN GONE ON TO PURSUE THE CHARGE. COMCAST HAS SET THEIR SYSTEM UP TO NOT EVEN QUESTION THE EQUIPMENT OR THE CHARGE & HAS TRAINED THEIR CUSTOMER CARE TO MISLEAD CUSTOMERS IN REGARDS TO THEIR BILLS. IF IT WAS A CHARGE ON MY ACCT FOR SOMETHING I REQUESTED, & I NEVER CANCELLED THAT WOULD BE ONE THING. FOR THERE TO BE AN INCORRECT CHARGE ON MY ACCT DUE TO A COMCAST EMPLOYEES ERROR & COMCAST REFUSE TO CORRECT IT, WHEN I FINALLY GET AN HONEST REP TO TELL ME WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON, THAT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE.

1351,"Comcast now caps my data plan and charges me overages. This means I am now forced to pay
 overages for commercials that play when I am watching television over the Internet."
1352,"I was just notified by a recorded message from Comcast that I had used 90% of my data plan. I have
 not ever had a data plan with them or ever had data allowance mentioned. After chatting with
 someone online I was told that I did not have a data plan and to ignore the phone call as it was a
 mistake. I had to contact them again after receiving an email saying the same thing. I was then told
 that I did have a data allowance of 300GB and that every customer was notified in 2012 when this
 happened. This is only one of the many issues I've had with Comcast. My # 1 complaint is that every
 person I talk to tells me something different. No one is on the same page. It has caused much
 confusion and even more problems than I had prior. I find that very unprofessional. It makes me
 question their training, the people that they hire and even what they are getting paid."

1355,"I live in Tennessee where Comcast Cable places data caps on customers for their service. I recently had and overage charge and was told by a customer account specialist that I can avoid overages by paying $10 more a month for an alternate plan of 105 mbps allowing for a total of 600 GB data allowance instead of the normal 300 GB. I gladly accepted and changed my plan. I had some other problems with the provider I had to clear up with regards to other services and spoke to 8-12 Comcast representatives within the past month. I was told from 90% of these representatives that that is correct. I spoke to a supervisor today because I got an alert I had gone over the data cap and show I am only 1/2 way to 600 GB and the supervisor advised me all the other people I had spoken with were wrong and I am responsible for the overages. He explained that the speed I pay for only gets 300 GB data allowance unless I live in Arizona and there is nothing they can do. On the phone they advised the policy states ""no customer can pay more for a plan that allows for more data"" and yet they find Arizona is an exception which is unfair to other consumers with the same plan who just happen to live in a different state. All this while some areas are not held to the data cap standards they have created. After speaking with the supervisor I called again to another department and the first thing she said was yes the 105 mbps plan I had allows for 600 GB. I advised her what I was just told and she finally found a similar piece of information that is exclusive to Arizona. I feel they are misleading customer coaxing them into paying more money by lying and then offering no options to get what they offered.

1356,"I attempted to acquire service through Comcast for internet on 6/1/15. There has been nothing but trouble since. The original account number was: but this was eventually changed to for reasons I'm unsure of by a representative who was attempting to activate my account. I've spoken to them on numerous occasions about activation, and at this moment I have waited 3 hours trying to get someone on their chat service since I do not want to speak with them regarding this issue any longer. My current issue is that I'm being billed a 2nd time for a deposit that I've already paid, which was processed on 6/1/15. The confirmation # with Comcast for this payment is 1328100150.
 Comcast has repeatedly told me that my new service could not be activated because it was past due, and now that the service is active they're billing me for something that I have already paid. There is also no mention of the $25 gift card that I'm supposed to be receiving for simply having the service. I'm tired of not getting answers when dealing with these people, and it is adding unwanted stress to my life. I don't have a lot of money, and being billed again for $50 when I've already paid it is not something I can afford. I can't get a response from this corporation that does not care about my time or my money, so this is why I'm contacting the FCC.

1357,"As I'm sure you are aware, Comcast is issuing fines when customers go over their 300 GB limit. As a long-time customer who is already paying a rather exorbitant fee for an internet connection only (no cable), I find this to be insulting and a hindrance to our family's way of life. In an era where everything entertainment-wise runs off our wireless connection, I find myself worrying if I should stop listening to Pandora as I clean the house, or if I should not check my email one last time before I go to bed. We've already gone over our limit once since the cap was put in place, and we're at 90% capacity this month. One of the most frustrating things about the Comcast data cap is that they don’t tell you what content, activities, or devices are hogging all the data. In many cases (myself included) data continues to be consumed even when you are not in the home. This leaves many to question the validity of the data use stated by Comcast.
 Please hear the customers' pleas and complaints about this issue and thank you for your time.

1360,"Comcast internet is delivered via coax cable. Coax is susceptible to signal attenuation related to a
 variety of factors, including temperature. On 5/30/2015 I contacted Comcast to report severe packet
 loss on my internet connection probably due to signal attenuation. The temperature had recently
 elevated. I made several calls to customer service. During the course of the first call, the
 representative scheduled a tentative appointment to verify ""my"" equipment. However, my equipment
 was functioning fine as I could measure the packet loss on the network. I expressed my displeasure
 at Comcast's unwillingness to address what was clearly not my problem. The first representative
 assured me he would speak with dispatch and call me back in 15 minutes. I received no call. I called
 again. After enduring the IVR system again, I finally got to speak with a representative and was
 forced to repeat the explanation of their problem again. I asked to speak with a manager. I was
 placed on hold for approximately 5 minutes and then their phone system disconnected me. I called
 for the 3rd time. IVR hell again. Explain to a new representative again. Asked to speak with a
 manager again. Hung up on again. I called a 4th time. One more pass through IVR hell and more
 minutes of annoying Vivaldi hold music. I then spoke with ""Jesse"" who claimed to understand my
 frustration. She did not put me on hold when I asked for a manager. However, after several minutes
 of waiting, she informed me that she would have to have her manager call me back. Her supervisor
 insisted she end the call with me so that she could ""help"" other people. She said her manager's
 name was Katie Belt. Jesse said Katie would call me within 5 minutes, or she herself would call me
 back in 10 minutes. I have received neither call. I would like Comcast to actually provide some
 customer service to a loyal, paying customer."
1361,"Comcast is charging me $30 more this month due to going over my data limit, that I didn't even know
 I had. This is causing me to not be able to use other services that I pay for. I believe this is just as

 lawful information."

You gave me a Ticket Number, not sure if that's the Case Number, it was 155419. 03/06/15 they tell me my monthly Bill is $39.99 with a $15.00 discount for a total of $26.99, $39.99 minus $15.00 is $24.99 not $26.99. For some unknown reason my April Bill was $18.89, now for my May Bill according to what the Bill says they have increased again to $46.99 for after May's Bill is paid. So what is it, when are they going to honor the agreement I made with the to pay $19.99 for a period of one (1) year, or the $29.99 I made with them 5 months after that that they changed yet again 2 months later, and they have changed yet yet again in two (2) months.

1364,"I ordered high speed internet and am using my own brand new modem/router. I was eligible for the self instillation and received the kit. After over an hour and people putting me on hold (only to get redirected to another person and having to start all over) I was told a free visit from a technician is necessary because a signal was unable to be sent to my modem and will happen two days from that call. I had to be there, and that a technician would call 30 prior to arrival. Nobody called or came so I called comcast only to learn that a ticket was put in for a sagging line and that the ticket was closed because there was no problem. After talking to several ""supervisors"" and a refusal from David to speak to his supervisor I was told I would have to wait several more days for someone to come out. I was unavailable from Sunday thru Friday and wanted someone out that evening or the following day (Friday evening or Saturday). I was told that is not possible, and I should schedule an appointment for when I was unavailable an find someone to be available for me. I repeatedly said that is not acceptable, this was there error and I expect them to fix it. I was told no, and I was not allowed to know the name or number of David's supervisor. I tried to call again only to be put in hold and sent to someone else. At that time I asked to be transferred to a customer complaint department. I was told I could be given the number and was given the number of the main menu. There was no option for customer complaint and was disconnected by the automated person (who was actually the easiest person to understand language wise). Comcast is my only option for internet, otherwise I would gladly go with a different company.

1365,"four times in a span of less then two months my internet provider, comcast (xfinity), has throttled my internet speeds with no reason or apology for the inconvenience. for most of this time we were paying about a $100 a month for 25mbps speed and were only getting between 6mbps and 12mbps. Every time I call and complain they take five ten minutes and boost my speed back up. They also say without saying the words exactly that my speed was throttled and had to be reset. Nothing has been done to explain why it is always lower then advertised and even replaced a modem with a new one and get same results. Starting to feel that my family and I are being ripped off by the comcast company . They also tried several times to sell us a 50mbps speed and after ordering it, had a tech tell us they don't even carry that speed, but they were going to bill me for that speed until I complained. Something needs to be done to let them know that they cannot continue these bad business practices

1366,"Called because of a cut cable at the pole that interrupted my service. At first the said it would take a week to get the problem resolved. After transferring through 3 other departments the finally said that someone would be out in 2 hours. Four hours later when calling back to find out what was causing the delay I was told that the other department did lie to me. The then told me they would get the problem resolved on Sunday e.g. in 40 to 54 hours. I have no idea if that will come true or not. Their track record is not so good so far. As Comcast has no competition in my area there is no incentive for them to improve service or keep prices low. Regulations have given Comcast a monopoly in my area. My choice for Internet is Comcast, do without or move to somewhere that has more choice of internet service providers. Not really a choice.

1368,"Hi, This is the 2nd time I've complained about this and I'm pretty irritated that the problem has not been fixed. I am trying to get a glimpse of what packages are available in San Francisco on behalf of my elderly sister. I don't want to sign up today, I am just trying to find out what kinds of packages/pricing exists today. When you go to the Comcast site, you're directed to xfinity and if you click on the button to 'shop deals' you are taken to a screen to create an online account - I don't want an online account, I just want information. I then clicked on the 'help chat' facility and got the same run-around from the online help person - wanting all of my information and he also pointed me to the same web page which has no information...I repeatedly told him I was not ordering today - just window shopping - got absolutely nowhere.
 Since comcast has a monopoly in san francisco, this seems wildly inappropriate. Can't believe it's legal.
 I am trying to do this research for my elderly sister who lives in SF and she is NOT technically capable ...

1371,"I have had uninterrupted Comcast service since 9/2003. In 12/2014 I received a bill that was actually for a condo association (address was similar). I reported the error to Comcast. In February I went to order a movie but could not because I had a past due amount. I have never missed a bill since 2003. Somehow my account and personal information has been linked or given to another customer. I asked for a bill in December 2014 but I think it is going to a wrong address. I made a payment that day over the phone but have no idea who's account I paid for or what I owe currently. My internet went out and I called to have a technician come out; they did not show up 4 different times (maybe going to wrong address). Over the last four months I have called Comcast over 20 times and I cannot get this resolved. One agent told me they were canceling my account and starting a new one, and sending 7 new boxes (I have 7 TV's hooked up). I did not authorize this as I paid an electrician to come in and install these for me, and I do not want a different account number. Resolution: I would like a management person of Comcast to get involved and fix this issue, I want the same account number and my billing fixed. Currently, my service is OFF I need this restored. Please give me a call to fix.

 Request #224940 ""Comcast has fraudulenlty releas..."" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #224940:
 I've had uninterrupted cable service at; Naples, Fl 34102 since 2003 with the following account number;
 During December 2014 someone that works for Comcast took my account number listed above and without my permission assigned it to another persons address which is a condo. The address is similar to mine but isn't mine. (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 I've since had four missed service appointments by comcast technicians who are showing up to the incorrect and switched address. I've called over 20 times since the middle of December and not once has Comcast been able to have a manager or a person with authority call me directly at my cell; . I've asked multiple times to communicate with a manager and each time the call service rep refuses to allow me to speak with their supervisor. I've filed several phone complaints through the Comcast automated survey system. I currently don't have cable TV now because someone at Comcast fraudulently opened a new account in my name without my permission. and closed my 11 year old account. When I call to inquire as to the reason comcast fraudulently closed my account the representative says because it was billed to an incorrect service address. I explained this is a brand new problem that just started happening during December 2014. Each time I call the CSR says there's no way for the computer system to make such an error and it's not possible for an account number to be redirected to a different persons service address. This is a serious problem for Comcast to not be able to fix. The cost of the electrician was well over $400 to have him install all seven of these boxes just last year on all my TV's. Now Comcast is forcing me to pay over $400 again to have an electrician remove all the boxes for each TV and install these new boxes which are EXACTLY the same as the boxes I'm removing. Comcast hasn't resolved any of these issues furthermore Comcast has a network interface device BOX hanging off my exterior wall by the cable wires. Due to the age of the box it's simply fallen off the wall. I've called multiple times to have a tech remount the box. Comcast has FAILED to do so. As of now I have NO TV. I want my 11 plus year old account number turned back on immediately. I didn't authorize anyone to deactivate this account. Then I need all my boxes in working order the way they have been working since January 2014 with my correct home address.
 Then lastly I need a technician to come out and move the N.I.D. so it doesn't fall off the wall againg due to being located in a very bad spot where people bump into it often.
 ... I'm currently without service.
 I haven't received a bill since December 2014 I've paid a bill and asked for a receipt to be mailed to me. I've never received a receipt. I have no idea what I paid for by phone.
 Now my account that's been open since 2003, () has been closed without my permission. Now I'm being told by Comcast"
1372,"Dear sirs,
 We presently have Comcast, TV, Internet, and Phone service. Since we have moved to our new address every bill we have received has been incorrect - high.
 The present bill (Mar) was $31.66 high. This extra amount was not included in the amount due, but was charged (IMO, fraudulently) to our checking account anyway. Comcast did not even provide a reason code for the extra amount.
 After several phone calls, and numerous Comcast representatives promising to contact us back concerning these erroneous charges, but no reason was given.
 We finally called thier Executive Customer Service Dept and were advised we were being charged for $130 of equipment that was not returned when we moved. So we were being charged $31.66 for $130 of equipment? Their explaination is comical! When we moved a Comcast technician actually picked up the old equipment and replaced it with other equipment! Therefore, no equipment was withheld from Comcast. Besides charging someone $31.66 for $130.00 of equipment is a made up reason. Why charge $31.66, if $130.00 is due?
 Comcast has given us a temporary credit while they research thier error, but is still using our money for 30 days without our authorization. This is the second time thus has happened since Nov 2014. The first time was alledgedly due to a billing error on thier part - due to the fact that someone did not read the notes on our account.
 While we are presently researching our options in leaving Comcast all together, but this type of (IMO) illegal fraudulent conduct needs to be stopped. It takes hours of phone calls to talk about these situations. The majority of my phone call usage at my home regards Comcast.
 Can the FCC address Comcast regarding thier fraudulent billing process (My Opinion). As a former White Collar Crime Investigator and RICO trained investigator I believe action needs to be taken against Comcast.
 Please help.

1373,"I signed on with Comcast internet in October 2014 at my FL condo and I planned to log in remotely from Mass. during Nov & Dec. Unfortunately, the internet was not usable and Comcast repetitively told me that the problem was not on their end. I returned to FL in January and continued to have daily internet problems all the way through March. After numerous telephone calls, equipment changes, two service visits and added personal expense, Comcast finally had a technically competent service tech review the problems and determine the cause to be in the DOCSIS 2 vs DOCSIS 3 configuration setup on utility pole outside my condo. They finally made line/equipment changes and corrected the problem in late March. When I contacted Comcast & asked for some cost relief for the 6 months of unreliable service, they told me that I'm on a new customer promotional rate so there's nothing they could do. I did not expect that a promotional rate meant unreliability and un-usable service. I think that I should be partially reimbursed or have the promotional rate extended an additional 6 months for the unreliability of the service, not to mention my additional costs for modem & router purchases. Comcast refuses to respond to my requests.

 Then at 5 pm I did a chat analyst conversation in which the analyst verified with the tech will be there tonight. At 7 pm no show so I chatted again. The analyst claimed to check with the tech and told me it was still a go. Even added a $20 credit to my account. At 7:45 I did another chat with another analyst who told me I rescheduled to Thursday between 3-5. Immediately called Comcast who told me that I rescheduled. I just bought the house 3 days ago. I'm the only person I know in the area and can rest assure that I didn't reschedule. I was told my appt was at 3-5. Which is hilarious because I'm still at work at 3 and have a 45 min commute. I was placed on another call with another service rep. Total time wasted 5 hours. Total lies told by comcast employees =3. I was told a supervisor would call me back tonight. It's now 10:10 pm. No call.

1376,"After being told by a local (Naples, FL) Comcast Representative that my internet service cost would
 be $39.99 for 24 months, Comcast almost DOUBLED my rate ($78.95). On 05/27/2015, from Naples,
 FL @ 0700, I called Comcast customer service. I spoke with ""Dan"" in the Philippines and explained
 the situation. Dan said he could not help me and I would have to speak to a different representative
 in another department but they did not open until 0800. I waited until 0830 and called the department
 Dan instructed me to call which was ""Downgrade my service"". This time I got a person named ""Loita""
 also in the Philippines. I explained the situation to her and what I had been promised as $39.99 for
 their BLAST internet service. She explained she would ""re-instate"" my ""promotional rate"" for another
 12 Months @ $39.99. She explained I would have to make my payment of $78.95 and that I would
 be credited the difference ($38.96) on my next bill (June 25th). She said she would email me the
 terms and that I should make my payment after I received the email. FOUR hours passed and I did
 not receive ANY email. I call back again to the same number and options. This time I got ""Art""
 employee number 1581275 ALSO in the Philippines. I explain I have not received the email that Loita
 said she was sending me. He then checked my account and now tells me the price I will receive is
 now $78.95 but he will make sure I get the ""promotional rate"" NOW of $49.99.
 The FCC needs to levy some heavy fines and penalties on this company. This is now the SECOND
 time they have attempted to pull this on me. I ended up having to drive to a ""local"" Comcast
 storefront to get it straightened out the last time which was a was of my time and gas mileage. I
 KNOW this is not just me this is happening to. I hear these complaints all the time from people in my

 Naples, FL 34102
 I HAVE NOT USED A LEASED MODEM FOR OVER THREE YEARS AND IN SPITE OF REPEATED EFFORTS, COMCAST REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR AND CONTINUES TO CHARGE A MODEM RENTAL FEE. Details Follow. Supporting documents attached.
 On 12/12/2011 I returned the UBEE modem (SN 1018800416294) that I had been leasing from Comcast. [See attached Item 1 showing return receipt and photo of returned modem’s ID data]. At about the same time I purchased a Motorola SB5101 modem
 (SN 314158119511117901011005) and installed it to replace the leased modem [see item 2 showing photo of that modem as it is installed in my home].
 ON 8/1/2012 I noticed that I was still paying a modem rental charge and I called Comcast to notify them that I was incorrectly being charged for a leased modem. I was told that an Escalation Report would be filed but didn’t record a confirmation number for it.
 On 12/20/2013 I received a letter from Comcast stating that they were reinstating the modem rental fee because I still had a leased modem. On 12/27/2013 I called and was told that they had incorrectly recorded that I had returned my PURCHASED modem, not my LEASED modem. (say what?) I was given confirmation number 019886004 for an Escalation Report and told that it would be corrected [see Item 3 Comcast letter with my notes on phone call].
 I later noticed in my 04/2015 Comcast invoice that I was still being charged the modem rental fee. On 4/18/2015 I called Comcast and was told that an Escalation Report had already been filed and that it would be updated. The updated Escalation Report’s number was 028556090. I never heard any response. [No item available other than my own notes]
 The modem rental fee is still being charged [see Item 4 Comcast invoice dated 06/01/2015].
 I respectfully request that Comcast be told to stop the practice of abusing customers with clearly inappropriate charges, and that I be reimbursed for all modem rental charges since 12/12/2011. (b) (6)

 I received a call from ""Fay"" today at Comcast, who informed me that she
 was responding to this complaint, and was in Comcast's ""FCC Complaint
 Department."" I had received a notice call at the end of last week,
 telling me that Comcast would listen to the initial sales call, and
 determine if my complaint had any validity.
 During the call today, I was informed that Comcast must have been
 correct, essentially because they make no mistakes with billing,
 although they had not located nor evaluated their earlier call. They
 also informed me that my monthly rate would further increase in another
 6 months, for unclear reasons, with a tone suggesting that they could
 undertake this again if I lodged other complaints. While Google may
 enter this market over the next few years, at the moment I am in fact
 dependent on Comcast for any high speed internet.
 They did not address the fact that my earlier calls went to voicemail,
 and were not returned, and the complaint was then closed because I was
 ""unresponsive."" Again the substance was that they were inerrant.
 I was told that I may hear from a more senior person at Comcast, when I
 indicated that I found this call insufficient to resolve the complaint.
 The entire response was without content, and appeared to be intended to
 intimidate. It was a very unpleasant experience, intrusive, and during
 work hours.

1383,"Due to the implications of data allowances I have been paying over $100 a month for using my $40 monthly internet connection.

1384,"Consumer is having billing issues with Comcast (internet). She has been charged by Comcast for
 things she was told she would not be charged for. Comcast did see then that there was a note saying
 she would get charged. That issue was resolved. In February 2015 she cancelled all services and
 turned in the equipment a few days later. She then ordered the most basic internet package for
 $34.99 per month or $29.99 per month if she did the eco bill. She went to Comcast on 02/27/2015
 and paid her bill in full. For some reason, every month now her bill is not for $34.99. Her first bill was
 for $102. She contacted Comcast and spoke to Janet in West Palm Beach on 03/18/2015 who said
 there was no balance and she actually had a credit on her account. On 04/24/2015 her service was
 disconnected for a past due bill of $102. She called Comcast again and paid $48. This
 representative assured here that everything was zeroed out and by paying the $48 it would be taken
 care off. They said it was an error on her end. The representative assured her this would not happen
 again. Her bill today was for $141, with $98 past due. Kathy from Indianapolis today said that she
 owes $141 from February. Kathy says there are no notes from last month’s call. She spends 25-40
 minutes on the phone with Comcast each month trying to resolve this. As a resolution, she would like
 to receive her bill with the correct amount, saying she owes $34.99. The bill should be the same
 every month. ***CTR359-phone***"
1385,"I am filing a complaint against Comcast, for their deceptive practices regarding metered data usage.
 In my area, Comcast has instituted a data ""threshold"" of 300 GB, which if exceeded results in a $10
 overage fee for an allowance of an additional 50GB. There is no option in place to subscribe to a
 higher threshold, and there is no availability for alternate internet service in my area. This practice is
 essentially extortion, and is a means for Comcast to discourage it's customers for using internetmedia
 as opposed to Comcast television services. Beyond this, I was not informed of this policy prior
 to enrolling in their internet plan, although it would have hardly mattered since I do not other options. I
 ask that the FCC and chairman Wheeler to please look into bringing these ISPs within regulation, and
 make the internet the utility that they promised earlier this year. I am tired of having to interface with
 the arrogance of this company, because of the necessity of internet in my life. Help me FCC, you're
 my only hope."
1386,"In light of the spirit of the FCC ruling for net neutrality, I am writing to make the point that Comcast's
 data cap policy runs counter to the philosophy of an open internet. I understand the need to have
 rules to deter serial bandwidth abusers, I feel that the current caps in the Nashville market are in
 place due to a virtual monopoly and as a means to force additional services on consumers provided
 by Comcast. Indeed, it seems impossible for the consumer to decipher how Comcast determines
 how much of their allocated data has been used, beyond seeing the final result of it on their website. I
 doubt sincerely that they err on the side of the consumer in their calculations. This is unfortunate, as
 such caps prevent consumers from switching video services, and thus destroys competition in the
 market."
1387,"I have Comcast cable and have been notified that I am exceeding my allocated data usage.
 Apparently I am only allowed 300GB of data per month. Afterwards, I am going to be billed $10 for
 every 50GB I exceed this limit. My family watches a lot of online television (HULU, Netflix, Amazon)
 and I feel that I am being forced to choose between these services or Comcast's own services.
 Comcast is basically saying, ""Hey, watch TV and don't stream. There is no data cap on TV."""
1388,"Comcast is now capping internet usage to 300 gb under a ""trial"" in only certain areas, currently ky tn ga and al. Two-and-a-half years is exceptionally long for a ‘market trial'. I'm under the impression this was regulated via title II of the FCC. Please bring this to your attention.

1390,"I was given by Comcast the higher tier of internet because of poor customer service. They called me back to make the offer since they did such a poor job.
 It was suppossed to be $19.99 mo for the 50mbps service for 24 months. 9 months later, my internet is slowed to a crawl. I call and they say I have been downgraded to the lowest speed because that is what I am paying for. After multiple calls, being hung up on, not receiving calls back, nobody seems to know why this happened, and they cannot give me back what I had and was promised. The worst customer service possible. And they dont care...they just pass you around, and hope you give up. I'm not!

 This is in response to Comcast's response. I received an email yesterday evening with a copy of the letter going to the FCC. (b) (6)
 I found numerous errors in that letter, and when I asked them why I did not see it before it was sent to the FCC, they said the case is closed.
 Yes, they finally did get the initial problem fixed, but not until I contacted the FCC, but the the customer service problem still exists and they cannot give me an explanation why this happened. They tried blaming me saying the promo period ended, but they fixed it. They are trying to make themselves sound like they made no errors and that I am an idiot.
 My question is why did it have to be escalated this high? Why did a week of calling, hang ups, no call backs could they not find someone who could help. I encountered some of the rudest people, nobody wanted to help, just pass you off til you give up.
 This case should not be closed. You need to look into their customer service and why it is so bad.

I was originally quoted a price of $39.99 however now when my bill has arrive they are charging me $44.99 and refuse to honor the price I thought I was paying as they say they have no record of that. The only reason I can see that they have no record is because they have been giving me the run around. I have spent over 20 hours on the phone and waiting for two different service technicians just to get my internet installed and then get billed for a different price. I have far more to this ordeal that I can share about being transferred repeatedly to non-working numbers, giving my personal information and then them saying they have no record of me in the system when I call back, to being lied to and then called a liar.

1392,"I thought it was important to add to the complaints regarding high data cap overage charges in areas where Comcast dominates the market. I'm regularly paying $10 to $50 a month for overages because I use Netflix, Amazon and Hulu rather than Comcast cable, and there are no higher-tier options. I've been told I could loose service altogether, and the only real competitor, A&T, does not offer a competitive service in my area. Although, thankfully, Google Fiber is coming to Nashville, I feel like Comcast is ripping me off while they still can. I'm sure this same situation will be very unfortunate for those in areas where Comcast/Verizon/AT&T will maintain their monopolies and duopolies for the near future. Thank you!

1395,"Comcast has instituted a cap on my broadband internet service without telling me. When I reach my service cap each month my speeds drastically slow down.
 I've called multiple times about the slow speed. Often times they would ask me to do a speed test and it would instantly speed up only to slow down 30 minutes later back to snail speeds. They also refused to go by the results of a third party speedtest.net site and insisted I used their comcast speed test site. I would run them back to back and consistently the third party test would report speeds 3-8mbs slower than comcast a proprietary speed test site.
 In addition to this, their employees lied to me on the phone stating that they have had the data cap as long as they have provided Internet service. That it is nothing new and that it's actually higher than their competitors. All issues I know are not true. A simple search online will tell you they've tested the cap in parts of Nashville since 2012, not forever. What's worst is they don't disclose this to you in their ads/offers so consumers can't make a fair comparison of what they are getting.
 When I finally called in and reached someone helpful she was able to schedule a technician visit to see if they could find a problem with the line. The technicians called three times and tried to convince me it was a ""national problem"" and that they had fixed it and I should cancel the call. I told them each time I was home and my internet wasn't working still. But they insisted if I gave it more time it would start back on its own. Even when they were at my home testing the service they kept saying it should be working fine and then I show them that no equipment (wifi or hard line connected) could get a signal. They said their equipment showed a signal so it's not them and tried to leave again. I asked them to please physically check everything instead of relying on their network iPad diagnostic and it turns out there was a bad wire connection from their last installer.
 I am a cord cutter. No cable just streaming and local antenna.

1398,"I called Comcast on February 20 of 2015 to cancel both my cable and internet service. For whatever reason, Comcast cancelled the internet but did not shut off the cable service until March 14. They issued a refund for overpayment of my last bill in the amount of $38.06. I called to enquire why I did not receive a full refund ($77.85) and was told that they did not terminate the cable service until March 14. I responded that I instructed for all services to be terminated on February 21. The agent I spoke with on April 16 told me they would issue a separate refund check, backdating the cable termination to the appropriate date of February 20 and I would receive the check in 3-4 weeks. I asked for the check to be expedited but was told this was impossible. I called today (June 24) to enquire about the status of the remaining refund but was told the refund was never processed. I spoke to Carla (operator ID OSR3TD). She would not issue a refund and when I repeatedly asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told all the supervisors were busy. Carla took my phone number and said she would have John, a supervisor, review my issue and would have him call me back.
 I would like to request the FCC's assistance in obtaining the appropriate refund the agent told me would be issued on April 16. The account was under my wife name.

 Dear FCC, (b) (6)
 RE: COMCAST service at New Bedford MA 02740
 Thank you very much for taking my complaint seriously.
 I have had another problem w. COMCAST. As a Limited Basic subscriber, I am entitled to receive Channel 22 which is FOX 25 Boston. Comcast keeps blocking my access. I have finally called twice, last Sa 6/27/15 and on Monday, 6/29/15 and demanded to speak w. a Manager because 'no one can figure out what is going on...and can't help me. I was connected finally on Monday to John, Management Team Supervisior ID 3650265 in Virginia at 11:10 AM on 6/19/15, who still had no idea why I was being blocked intermittently. He told me to call Comcast and refresh my signal whenever it happened. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!
 Please investigate this issue. When I first subscribed to Comcast in the 1990s, the call center was in Nova Scotia.the reps were wonderful..would help you w/ and internet issue .. Now w. these digital boxes, they are horrible and I refuse to buy new TVs.
 Thank you once again for your assistance w. Comcast.

1407,"I have been workng with Comcast for over 6 months. I have literally spent hours on the phone over that period, lost money in my small business waiting for techs who tell me the issue is mine, spent money on new modems. been stood up by techs, transfered from one customer service department to another and found out that even though it appeared I was receiving their internet, I was not. The money was coming out of my cell phone data. They have regulary charged me additional fees, monthly fees and still I go through the routine over and over. There is no place to call and issue a formal complaint so the issue is resolved. There is no other ""game in town"" so they don't have to fix the issue and can continue to bill me and cut off service if the only way to ""protest"" is to not pay the bill for services I am not getting. Please help me. This is not something I can continue to waste my resources on. I have to work. And I am working to pay a bill for services I am not receiving. Thank you.

1408,"I called Comcast customer service on 6/17/15 because my modem/router went dead. I attempted to reboot it several times, but no lights came back on. I told this to the customer service rep. He made no apology for the lack of service; did not appear the least bit sympathetic, and did not take any initiative to resolve the problem. On the contrary, he seemed to do everything in his power to make me go away. It was like pulling teeth the entire time. Case in point: When I explained my situation to him as plainly and articulately as humanly possible, stressing that despite my having rebooted the router several times, no lights came back on, his response was to ask me if there had been any power outages in my area. I said there had not been, as, at the time of my call, I was not sitting helplessly in the dark, nor were there lights off anywhere on my street. He checked and said that, indeed, no power outages had been reported in my area, but that it could be an outage nevertheless. As I had already assured him that there were no outages in my area, and even he could see no one had called in to report any, clearly this was not the case. Yet he seemed satisfied with this explanation and, to my dismay, attempted to terminate the call. I do not understand this, since, even if the problem with my modem was the result of a power outage, at the end of the day the problem remains and needs to be resolved. When I expressed my dissatisfaction with his response and said that I still needed help resolving the issue, he asked me if I had paid my Comcast bill this month. I could not believe he would ask me such a question! It was extremely disrespectful. He treated me as though I were some sort of criminal, indicating that the problem lay with me. I have never been asked such a thing in my entire life by a customer service rep. It was entirely insulting and degrading for me to have to prove myself to him. I replied that, as a matter of fact, I had paid my Comcast bill this month. Then he asked me if I had paid the bill in full. I assured him that I had (I even paid it early, before the due date). During my entire history with Comcast, I have never missed a payment or failed to pay in full in a timely manner. It felt to me that instead of being willing to help me, he was stone-walling me. He made me feel that Comcast could care less about me as a customer; that they are more than happy to take my money every month ($200!) but apparently they don’t feel obligated to go beyond that; if my system isn’t working, that’s my problem (even my fault!), not theirs. When he finally came to the unhappy realization that I wasn’t going to go away, he deigned to help me. However, he did not do so with any sort of enthusiasm or in a cheerful or even helpful manner. Instead, he did so grudgingly, speaking in a robotic monotone that indicated he felt very put out for having to help me. He asked me if I had tried to reboot the router. For the second time, I told him that I had already done so several times, and that no lights came back on. He told me to reboot it again. I did so. He asked me what lights came back on after he had sent a refresh signal. Once again, I told him there were no lights, which is why I was calling in the first place. He kept sending refresh signals to the router, but nothing was helping. He told me to try to reboot it yet again, this time first unscrewing the cable connection from the back of the router, waiting 10 seconds, plugging it back in, then once again trying to reboot by disconnecting the power. I did so. I reported once again that there were still no lights. He kept asking me what lights were coming on as if I must somehow be
 overlooking a display panel filled with blinking green lights. After we went around and around in this manner several times, he appeared to accept that, indeed, no lights were coming on the router, and said he was going to elevate the call to technical support.
 I greatly wish I could say that this unfortunate incident was a fluke -- the rude attitude of one rep out of a thousand --, and not, as I came to fear (see below), an indicator of the low standard of customer service one can expect from Comcast. As you will see below, not only was the next Comcast rep I spoke to gruff, robotic, apathetic, and seemingly about to doze off at any minute, she was unable to meet my needs within the confines of Comcast’s rigid policies, even when the call was elevated to a supervisor. Based on the flagrantly rude and indifferent service I received, how can one not conclude that Comcast reps are bred in a culture that does not place any value on customer service? In an era of exceptional customer service from other large corporations such as Bank of America and Amazon, who are genuinely committed to nourishing a culture of excellence in their customer service staff, and who deploy a veritable army of outstanding reps who consistently provide exceptional customer service and who are all we--trained, attentive, well-supervised, friendly, eager to assist, intelligent, personable, sympathetic to the customer’s needs, highly knowledgeable, and flexible in their ability to resolve the customer’s problems. Even more, at the conclusion of the call, they make sure to ask if they have answered all of the customer’s questions and resolved their issues. Comcast has never asked me this; instead, they are glad enough to terminate the call with complete indifference as to whether or not my problems have been resolved, and it is only through a monumental effort on the part of the customer to receive assistance. Furthermore, Bank of America and Amazon always send a follow-up mail survey asking the customer to rate the level of service he/she received from the rep who assisted him/her. I asked the reps if their supervisors really look at those survey responses, and am told that their supervisors read each and every one and take the customer’s comments very seriously in assessing the quality of the reps and act accordingly. In other words, that rep’s reputation and possibly his/her job are on the line. I have never received such a survey from Comcast. Bank of America and Amazon are two examples of companies who have earned my trust and appreciation; I will be customers of theirs for life. I cannot say the same about my feelings towards Comcast. I would leave today if I hadn’t been forced into a contract. As it is, I am considering breaking it and paying the difference just to get out. To make a long story short, Comcast’s service lags way behind the standard of excellence in customer service today. It surely receives enough profit to invest it its customer service. Comcast should remember that it is no longer the only game in town.
 Moving on to my next encounter with Comcast’s customer service team, the supposed technical support specialist I was transferred to was surly and unhelpful. Her manner was gruff and unfriendly. She, too, appeared put off by my call, and spoke in the same wooden monotone as the previous rep, as though she were walking through a bad dream and hoped she would soon wake up. I explained the situation, and told her that I had tried to reboot the router several times on my own, and that the last customer service rep had also walked me through rebooting the router several times, and still there were no lights coming on, which is why I had been transferred to her. Apparently she hadn’t been listening to what I was saying because the first words out of her mouth were that I should reboot the router! I once again did so for the umpteenth time. It was very frustrating and tiresome continuously being told to reboot the router, and having to repeat myself over and over again. I didn’t know what she was doing, or if she was even still on the line because a series of long, drawn out silences ensued, necessitating me to repeatedly ask if she were still on the line. After going through the identical steps with this rep that I had undergone with the previous rep, and again having difficulty convincing her that, indeed, there were no lights on the router, she said a technician would have to come out to replace it. Then she said that the technician would call before arriving. I told her that, since my Comcast phone was obviously dead due the router malfunctioning, I would not be able to
 receive such a call, and asked that the appointment be made, and I would be sure to be there when the technician arrived. She replied that she could not make the appointment without having a phone number for the technician to call. I again reiterated that I did not have another number to give her. She repeated that the appointment could not be made. I had apparently hit a brick wall because she offered me no other solution and just kept repeating that she could not make the appointment without a phone number. The only solution to my dilemma that she offered was to send me a new router. This was unbelievable to me, putting the onus on the customer to solve a problem that Comcast had created due to its malfunctioning equipment! Even so, I would have been willing to accept the router via mail if I’d had any notion how to install it. I told her this. She apparently could care less. She actually said in a surly tone, “You have three options. You can provide a number for a technician to call, you can go to your nearest Comcast office to get a new router, or a router can be sent to you.” As none of these supposed “options” were really options at all, I asked her if she could just make the appointment for me. She kept saying she couldn’t do so without a phone number and I kept saying I didn’t have a number for the technician to reach me at, and we went round and round for awhile until I was very frustrated and fearful that my problem would not be resolved and that, furthermore, Comcast did not care one way or the other. At that point, I told her I didn’t want to argue with her and asked her to transfer me to a supervisor.
 Again, I wish I could report this was the end of my woes, but I was once again disappointed. After waiting a good while for the supervisor to come on the line, he finally did so, and I explained the situation of needing to make an appointment without providing a telephone number for the tech to reach me. He reiterated what the rep had told me, that they couldn’t make an appointment without a phone number. He explained to me that the appointments are sent directly to dispatch via an automated system. I asked him if he could call dispatch and make the appointment directly. He said he could not do so because he didn’t have the number to dispatch. How can he not have the number to dispatch? If the appointment can be set by calling customer service, then they should be able to help in cases where a phone number cannot be supplied. He explained that this is Comcast’s policy and that there is nothing he can do about it; that the appointments are made by customer service and sent via automated system to dispatch. I asked if he could somehow notate in the email that they should come out to the appointment without calling, since I did not have a working phone. He replied that he could put it in the notes but since it is an automated system, this probably wouldn’t change things. I was absolutely floored that Comcast did not intend to offer any further help in resolving my issue and that Comcast’s policies are set up in such a rigid and inflexible manner that they cannot accommodate the customer in any way. It should not be necessary to speak to a supervisor in order to get help with such a small issue. I then offered to give him my roommate’s number for them to call and leave a message because she would be at work and may not be able to take the call. He told me that someone had to answer the phone, otherwise the appointment would be automatically cancelled. I find it unthinkable that the dispatch office cannot be reached. As I kept insisting that I had no other way for them to contact me except via my roommate’s phone, it was finally agreed that the technician would call during a four-hour window that would begin after she got off work so that she would be able to take the call. I expressed that I felt that dealing with Comcast’s customer service and encountering its inflexible policies that make it totally unresponsive to the customer’s needs was not right, and that, while I understood that the supervisor could not do anything to alter Comcast’s policy, I believe it is not right that Comcast cannot be at all flexible in assisting customers to resolve their problems. He agreed with me that it is unfortunate and offered to give me the number to “corporate complaints.” The number he gave me (215-665-1700) proved to be a false number, and not Comcast’s supposed “complaint department.” Instead, it was the number of a random law firm who knew nothing about Comcast’s corporate complaint department. I verified the phone number that was given to me as being their phone number. Thinking I might have written the number down
 wrong, I went to Comcast’s website to search for the corporate complaints number. I could find no such number or department. I then tried to google it and still found nothing. When I called the FCC regarding filing a complaint against Comcast, they told me that Comcast does not have a corporate complaints number, or even a corporate complaints department. It is appalling to me that a representative of Comcast would outright lie! Is this how Comcast does business? Not like a responsible corporate entity providing an honest service to its customers and standing by its product, but like some sleazy, fly-by-night operation based on lies and circumvention?

1410,"Contacted Comcast in March for business and residential service. instructed them I needed internet in three separate structures. Thinking they would understand this meant 3 separate buildings. One in the home one in the garage and one in a warehouse. They scheduled it and when the technician arrived he informed me he could only do the house. He then tells me he cannot install my outlets where I requested so he used the original outlets then I receive a bill for the outlets he did not install. After the technician leaves another one pulls in the driveway and tells me I can get a better receiver and security for 5.00 more a month and he will have the business department call me. On the 27th of march they send me contracts that require me to sign a 36 month contract and pay for three separate internet connections. I agree because this is the way I make a living so have no choice. The build crew shows up on April 23rd and does part of the build then completes on the following Sunday. Now I receive a call that one of the installs came thru and a technician should be out on Thursday to do the install.The will let me know about the second install.There is no accountability for any of this so I am forced to continue. The quality of the service with Comcast is at best mediocre and the way they have backed me into a corner where I am forced to follow thru is unbelievable.

1411,"I am writing to FCC today because the sales tactics used to upgrade my services were misleading and have left me very disappointed. I called in to see if there were any deals in which I could lower my monthly bill. The sales representative reviewed my account and said since I was a valued customer that he could offer me the Xfinity Triple Play package which would lower my bill before taxes by almost $25.00 per month and free installation with a 2 year agreement. The price would be $119.00 per month. I asked if this price would be good for the life of the contract and he said yes. I later called Comcast back a few days later inquiring about installation since a self-install kit was mailed to my house (this was after spending some time online chatting with an agent trying to resolve this issue) and spoke to Michael Brew. He was extremely helpful but the original sales representative did something I feel was wrong. The sales representative when talking to me over the phone, flat out lied to me. When he compared my current package versus the new package there was one BIG KEY FACT LEFT OUT. He compared my current package with equipment rental included per month to the new package without equipment rental, but did not state this even though I asked if this was lower than what I was paying now and he said yes. Also this price is not good for 2 years, it is only good for 1 year and then it goes up. I have spent hours trying to resolve all the issues I have been experiencing, took a day off from work waiting for a technician to install the equipment to only find out it’s a self-install kit, which was not what was discussed on the phone. I am writing to get what was promised and agreed to on the phone, service with equipment at a rate of $119.00 per month for two years. The sales representative said my monthly savings would be about $25.00 per month and that is what I agreed to.

1412,"My only available cable broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own in the same speed tier without cable was 90 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 I have spoken to Comcast representatives numerous times looking for options to reduce my monthly costs, however they have not been able to offer anything. They do have lower, promotional pricing listed on their website and Direct Mail marketing materials, but they are unwilling to offer these to their existing customers.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

I'm a single mother and I go to school online and I can never load the pages I need to do my homework. This is such a inconvenience for me as I have call for months and months. The customer service is just horrible and rude, they keep me on hold for 30 minutes, I have been on the phone for over 1 hour and a half. I have spoken to managers on end and my problem just cannot get fixed. I requested for a technician to come out to my house and then I'm told I will be charge if I don't go through the same troubleshooting I've done almost everyday that I have called. The manager even send me instructions to supposedly fix my internet connection and nothing works.
 I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is to go through this on a daily basis.
 I am not getting anywhere at all, I almost feel that since I downgraded my services to save money because I am a single mother, that I feel I'm being cheated so that I'm forced to upgrade to higher speeds. Please, please help me.
 Thank you,

1417,"I signed a 36 month contract with Comcast Business on July 12, 2012. My business closed in Dec 2012. Contract cancellation was @ $3000. Comcast offered to ""move"" the line to avoid cancellation fees and honor contract agreement - which was done July 2, 2013. I called April 3, 2015 to start initiating cancellation procedures ~ and was told that when the line was moved, the 36 month contract started over...meaning the contract doesn't end until July 2, 2016. I did agree to move the line ~ but I was never told this would add another year to my contract. On April 3, 2015 ~ Comcast customer service lowered my payment by $30 month...but I am extremely displeased about the contract extension without my knowledge. This extension is an additional $1000+ that I was not aware of!
 To honor our contract, we have dealt with slow internet speeds and have had no cable service during this time (Comcast business does not allow cable tv at a home business account). I would only ask Comcast to honor their contract and end our service July 12, 2015.

1419,"Problem:
 In February/March 2015, I was contacted by a representative of Comcast concerning a contract for another 2 years of service. I explained to the representative that I would be moving from the home I rented on June 1, 2015 to an area where Comcast is not offered. I was told by the Comcast representative that if I were moving to an area where Comcast was not offered, I would not incur a penalty and that I should keep my rate for my service low. Before he proceeded to read the ""contract"" information, he told me to pay no mind to the penalty information as it would not apply to my situation. I did as I was told and he transferred me to an automated system to agree. On May 28, 2015, I contacted Comcast about ending my service. There seemed to be no problem, my new information was ""updated."" The new representative offered to have my service cut off that night. I opted for June 1, 2015. The new billing cycle would've begun June 4, 2015. Going through my accounts on June 8, 2015 after the move, I had received a new bill for the month of service AFTER June 4, 2015. I contacted Comcast. Once again I had to explain to them the situation and what I had been told my the representative in early 2015. I also had to ""update"" my information again. I also to explain to them that I was told services would end June 1, 2015. In their system, it was set as June 8, 2015. The representative adjusted my account and noted that I was told that June 1, 2015 was the date I was cited as the termination of services. Since then, I have received an early termination fee of almost $200.00. I contacted Comcast on June 18, 2015, again. I was told that because I am unable to transfer my services, I would have to pay an early termination fee. I explained to the representative what I had been told by the previous representative in early 2015. She stated that the early termination fee is stated in the contract. I would have to pay the fee. I stated that I was told different. It does not make sense for me to choose a $200 fee instead of a slight increase in services for 4 months unless I had been mislead intentionally or through the ignorance of an employee. I stated that I don't understand why I should pay $200 for an employee's misinformation. I asked for a supervisor. The representative stated that I would be told the same thing by the supervisor. After an extended hold, I spoke to the alleged supervisor. I had to try to explain it again. Though calm, the supervisor seemed disinterested in my explanation. She stated that they would make request to have the penalties removed. I asked her how I would be contacted to be notified of the decision, She stated that since my account was closed, they would not contact me. I would have to log on and view my bill in the future. Also, my former roommate, who had a login created to allow her to pay her half of the bill, has had issues with billing with her new account. They stated that she had an account previously. The account was in my name, not her's. She still lives in a Comcast area and has opened a new account with them for a smaller package. I don't know if they are trying to penalize me as they tried to penalize her. Once again, the account was mine. I have had an account with Comcast since 2009. I had it transferred in 2013 to the address where it was later terminated June 2015. In short, a
 company that I have used for quite a while, has gone from a company that I never had an issue with to one that is a nightmare with communication issues between employees and misinformed or deceitful employees.
 Desired Outcome:
 Seeing that I was intentionally or ignorantly misinformed by the Comcast employee who called me to update to a contract to avoid a bill increase and who was informed of my future residential changes, I feel that I should not have to pay a early termination penalty. If I had been correctly informed by the employee, I would have been able to make the correct decision to incur a slight bill increase for the 4 month period and not a whopping $200.00 fine for early termination.

1420,"Comcast has failed to provide me with adequate information in a timely manner during the planning, scheduling, and implementation of my personal residence's internet and television service. On several occasions I have received guarantees by call center agents that I would have service by the end of the next appointment, only to have a technician come out and tell me they cannot complete the installation. There is a severe disconnect between the call center teams and those out in the technical field. This causes appointments to be scheduled and cancelled without either party's awareness. The technicians have also failed to call me on one occasion when explicitly stated to do so in the order information.
 Additionally, when I attempted to discuss the technical nature of my install with the call center agents they could not provide any feedback due to a lack of experience/training on highly relevant topics. They also could not provide escalation to any technical staff members. Therefore, any discussion beyond scheduling and validating appointments falls to the way-side when speaking with the call center agents.
 I still currently do not have service installed, and this next appointment will be my 5th. I work from home often, so internet service is integral to doing my job. These issues have caused several delays in getting internet service at my residence.

1422,"I purchased Comcast internet service around the second week of June for my new home. I got a deal on their website - 50 mb/s @ $40/mo. for 12 months. It was installed Wednesday June 17th. That night, I had to contact Comcast customer service via their chat program because I forgot my login information and the lady told me I was paying around $78 for my service. I told her that was wrong and explained to her the deal I got. She basically said, ""Sorry if you were led to believe that, but that deal is no longer available."" I was essentially forced to get a new deal: 50 mb/s speed and cable for $49.99. I accepted even though I didn't want cable. I thought all was fine until the next day a storm hit and knocked out the power, screwing up my router. I see that my speed is reduced to around 25 mb/s so I call Comcast to diagnose the problem, confirm with them that my speed is actually 50 mb/s, and we figure out it's my router. A few days later, I get a new router and call Comcast to have it hooked up. They confirm again that my speed is 50 mb/s. I do a speed test later that day and realize I'm still only getting around 25 mb/s. So I have to call again. At this point I've had their service maybe... a week and two days. I spend two hours on the phone with them talking to various people about why I have reduced speed. The first girl argued with me over the price of my bill. My account was telling me $142-something and she was insisting it was $121 (and even when I called, the automated system told me I could pay my bill and that it was $142), and told me I had only 25 mb/s. I don't even know how they got those numbers. $50/mo. + $60 one-time install fee + tax does not amount to $142! The second person I talked to insisted I had 50 mb/s speed then sends me to a technician. The tech tells me, ""Oh, no, you have 25 mb/s because you downgraded."" I tell them I never asked for a downgrade, that the person I just spoke to said my plan was 50 mb/s, and tell them the deal I was forced to get because my last deal was apparently unavailable. They say, ""Sorry you were led to believe you could have this new deal but..."" And then try to give me a new deal, which is basically to pay $50/mo. for 25 mb/s. I was so infuriated, I finally got sent to the solutions department where, after re-explaining everything, they agree to give me 75 mb/s for $49.99/mo. but no cable. I have a confirmation e-mail explaining this. They said to give them until midnight for the change to go through but I gave them over 24-hours. My speed hasn't changed. My bill says I should be getting 75 mb/s but I'm not getting it. Then I got an e-mail response from a complaint I filed with the company saying, ""Oh, looks like you got it resolved with 25 mb/s!"" I wanted to scream. I tried contacting them again but they never responded. I am angry. They have lied to me, they have changed things on my account without my permission, they have failed to give me the service I asked for, and given me the runaround every time I try to call. I am constantly handed off to someone else so that no one is accountable for screwing up my service. My bill (whatever it is anymore, who knows) is due on the 8th and I don't even know what I'm paying for anymore. All I want is the service I asked for at the price they promised with clearly defined charges because this is absolutely ridiculous.

1424,"Consumer said that he lives in a rural area and Comcast is the only choice he has. He was gardening the other day and stuck a tool in the cable wire. He called Comcast to resolve this for him and fix the wire. He was told he didn’t need to be home at the time however his wife was home at the time and said that the tech laid a new wire outside but then told her he needed to look at the modem inside. He said that the tech ended up ordering equipment that the consumer never ordered. He said that there was no reason that the tech needed to come into his home after the company told him it wasn’t necessary. He also said his wife was alone at home which isn’t ok with him and no one is calling him back from Comcast. As a resolution he would like a call back from the local service provider in his area apologizing by phone/writing for their actions in this matter. He would like to know how the technician who came into his home was disciplined for doing this to the consumer. He would also like the wire to be buried in his yard. *** CTR 354-phone***

 June 19, 2015 - X1 service lost - I opened a trouble ticket and they were supposed to come fix it on June 20, 2015 - they did not show up nor call me
 June 20, 2015 - I call comcast to find out what happened. They tell me I didn't have an appointment for that day and I now have to appointments for June 22, 2015 - one from local Comcast technicians and one from their Special Request Order (SRO) group who is third party to them to check the quality of the X1.
 June 21, 2015 - Father's Day - No Service - Could not call relatives nor get calls
 June 22, 2015 - Took the day off to be at residence. Neither of the 2 appointments were made by the technicians and when I called to find out why - the help desk didn't know why. Both appointments rescheduled for Wednesday.
 June 23, 2015 - No Service Still
 June 24, 2015 - 2 appointments were not done and i was not called. I called help desk and escalate the trouble ticket where a Field Supervisor is suppose to call me and he/she did not call. Rescheduled appointments for the next day by comcast.
 June 25, 2015 - Informed that there was a problem with a junction box to the street and services should be up by 921PM. Both appointments were again cancelled by Comcast. Once again I call comcast and set up 2 new apps for June 26, 2015.
 June 26, 2015 - Once again, none of the appointments were completed nor was I called. I once again escalate the issue (029938811) to a supervisor and informed that the Field Service supervisor will call me by 1249PM and services restored by 449PM on June 27, 2015.
 June 27, 2015 - Field Supervisor does not call by the promised time. I call help desk again and am now told he/she has 24 hours from the time escalation done. I call at 801PM and am advised by the helpdesk that i now have an appointment on July 1, 2015. Once again, this ticket is escalated and I am supposed to be called by 1PM on June 28, 2015 with services restored by 8PM.
 This is horrible and now I have lost money from work by being at home for services, I cannot make phone calls - not even 911, I cannot finish my Doctorate level college work due to lack of internet, and nobody at this company wants to resolve this issue. I still have no service and now my cellular data bill has skyrocketed because of the data charges being incurred due to this issue. $15.00 for every Gigabyte over and I'm now 10 Gigabytes over and it's one Gig for every day over.

 I purchase the new Comcast X1 Infinity platform and it requires an internet connection to get internet, television channels, and phone calls. If the service is down, you lose all of the others and if the service is not optimal you do not get quality service. The basic internet speed plan offered by comcast is no longer good enough to push through the television and phone calls in the X1 service along with my home devices. I now have to upgrade the internet services to get faster uplink and downlinks so that I am functioning as I was before this new product line was implemented. This company upgrade is forcing me to increase my internet speeds thereby paying them more money and violates the Net Neutrality law."
1426,"In the past year I've experienced several outages in my Comcast services. The internet has been the most likely thing to go out, as often as four times per month. Outage times last from a couple hours to a day, and sometimes include outages of TV and phone service. The current outage has me without internet at my home for the past 26 hours, with no solid ETA from Comcast. I would switch providers, but there are no other alternatives for broadband service at my house; the only other ""competitor"" is 3Mbps DSL from Verizon. I'm forced to use my mobile data plan, and constrict my usage to stay under my data cap.

 speed internet carrier in our area. I must have high speed internet for my work. Service has been

 the self troubleshooting and nothing works. It seems that in our neighborhood the more people online
 the slower the system works. I tried today to speak with someone at Comcast/infinity and was hung
 up on 3 times and then was told the wait to speak with a person would be 20 minutes. It is Sunday

If I would be charged for the man coming out here, etc. I was informed that my first bill will be $55.54 no doubt by at least 3 different Comcast agents. The man who came here never once told me about a $39.99 home service fee. If I am correct and the two Comcast agents who told me this are correct, if you are going to be charged for the services of someone at your house, they must inform you before doing it. Also, I am being charged tax for TV services whilst, I only have internet services through them! Not to mention they sent out two self install kits! I only asked for the one, what would I do with two? I have been trying to get this all straightened out or cancel my services in that 30 day Comcast guarantee, however all week I've been told that the supervisor is in a meeting. Or on a phone conference. Or I just get hung up on. One time the agent even had another agent pretend to be a supervisor and they told me lie after lie, until it became obvious they were not a supervisor. I am very upset. All I wanted was for a supervisor to take the $39.99 off as I believe I should have been told before it was charged to my account, and two previous agents told me I would be told of any charge.

 Also, I have tried the online chat services to fix my password, and the woman told me it would just be a second to get a tempory password. She asked if I wanted to hear about a special promotion on my account for TV, I told her I didn't want to hear any of it, she went on for 10 mins whilst I'm telling her no I don't want it she kept going, I demanded my password and she gave it to me and left. Never have I felt like an agent was demanding me to purchase services I said no to so many times. It was harassment by definition.

1431,"I been getting over charged on my bill for the passed 5 months. I have called Comcast every month and the person I talked to took the charges off BUT when the next bill came it was the same thing all over again. On March 31 I called again and they said that I have not been paying the right amount. I have been paying what they tell me to pay because my bill has been incorrect. Also they said I owe a late fee. Their is no late fee on my bill.

1432,"I've been treated with near-evil amounts of neglect and hostility by Comcast/Xfinity. Their service didn't meet my expectations even when it was working, which was rare. Municipal fiber would be my proposed solution, but my state has deals with AT&T and Comcast that prevent us from getting this done. The goal of this complaint is to simply shine a harsher light on Comcast and force them to at least comply with modern expectations of customer service. Thank you.

1433,"I have called comcast/xfinity a bunch of times about my internet being down, I keep getting people
 from other countries that I do not understand them and when I ask to speak to someone in america
 they disconnect me, they have not helped me at all, all they want is to send me a tech so they can
 charge me the $49.00 fee..I have asked 3 times to get credit and they disconnect me, I pay promtly
 for a service that I am not getting..I am a dissabled individual and they offer me no help AT ALL.
 Please I want what i pay for INTERNET."
1434,"At the beginning of January I called to activate a promotion I saw online. The representatives told me I would have 50mps with blast and hbo and streampix for $49.99 plus tax. When my bill came in I was charged more than the $49.99 and was only getting 25mbps without blast. I called the following month to correct this and was told I would have to get a different promotion because the first was expired, but the cost would be about the same. I payed a late fee of $10 plus $50 and tax and was told the next month I would have 50mbs with blast, hbo and streampix and my bill would be back to normal. Now it is April and I keep getting fees added to my account. I called and the supervisor told me there was never a promotion such as the one I told her about and I would have to pay almost $70 a month. I asked her to listen to my past recordings and she refused! On top of this, I had no picture on my tv box and had to have a tech come in. I was promised before hand that there would be no fee and when the bill came in, I was charged $40. I feel as though I was manipulated to sign up and promised promotions that never existed. There should be a record of my calls with comcast where we discussed the original prices and promotions but once again, the supervisor refused to listen to them and told me there was nothing she could do for me.

If I am to pay for a 50mbps connection I at least expect 40mbps all the time at most, it feels like I'm paying a lot money for bad service and there's not much to switch to around here in Miami . There is AT&T , but they're much worse.. I have addressed this issue ,before with them ,but all they seem to do is send someone and they never fix anything.

1436,"1926 NE 154th Street North Miami Beach Fl 33162
 This is our 3rd complaint to the FCC for this account and location for the same
 spotty service from Comcast
 The last time a tech was out they said it was a broken fiber this is over 7 weeks ago
 i can only assume this fiber cable has been repaired.
 This is getting to be a real pain with Comcast and how they conduct their service.
 I had no issue with AT&T Comcast was faster what a big mistake to change.
 I will now have to demand a credit from Comcast for this marginal service they have provided a
 business class customer.
 We now have to invest in a back up ISP link from Sprint so it does not impact our daily business this
 is the 7th outage for the last week.
 Why does the FCC not force this ISP provider to have a better response time and service to business
 class customers."
1437,"We use Comcast for our cable and internet service. We have been having service issues since we
 moved into our house in 2006. We are also having billing issues where our rates fluctuate each
 month, we get different rate amounts on our statement, by recording and verbally by representative.
 We now have a new monthly rate without any explanation in writing. I have filed complaints with this
 company and we are still waiting for an account specialist to call us back. We need help to get these
 problems resolved once and for all."
1438,"Our issues with Comcast started when we first signed up for the XFinity Triple play package in April, 2014. At time of sign-up, Comcast agent Ferdinand D'Alfonso promised the inclusion of a 200$ Visa gift card. After installation and waiting for the gift card, multiple calls were made to Mr. D'Alfonso, who indicated he would send the gift card. After waiting months without receiving the gift cards, multiple calls were made to Mr. D'Alfonso, who would not return any calls after multiple voice mails were left. Calling the customer service representatives available on the Comcast website led to constant redirects until reaching an extension where they disclosed that our inquiry would not be remedied.
 In separate transaction in December, 2014 , my father decided to make a referral from an existing business account (hereby called 'Sense of Beauty') to create a new business account (hereby called 'UR Beauty Ful). The agent who previously helped my father establish the 'Sense of Beauty' account, Ms. Kimberly Clark, agreed that the opening of 'UR Beauty Ful' was a referral and would be rewarded the referral fee. In addition, she acknowledged the sign-up of the Business Voice and Internet package for 'UR Beauty Ful' would include a 100$ Visa gift card, as well a waiver for the 1st months bill. Similar to the transaction with Mr. D'Alfonso, a time period was spent waiting, followed by numerous calls that were not returned.
 The incidences described above occurred within a short period of time with different agents. Therefore, it can be concluded that Comcast may be engaged in dishonest and even deceptive marketing practices to create business transactions by falsely advertising for the inclusion of gift cards and/or bill waivers that were not intended to be materialized. The time period that we, the customers, have waited for a response yet found no solution availed upon us suggests that such tactics were clearly intended. Searches online disclosed that we were not alone in being victimized in this pattern.
 The most recent exchange, starting on April, 2015, between our party and Comcast in regards to said incidence was in the form of an e-mail sent to the following address: we_can_help@cable.comcast.com. An e-mail reply was received, acknowledging that they would help us to remedy and to call the following office line: (302)731-6318. A call to said office line resulted in a voice mail message, which clearly suggested avenues for Comcast to return correspondence. No such correspondence has been received. To prevent the disposal of additional time in the matter, the complaint against Comcast will be filed to the FCC. We expect Comcast to follow through with their committed actions appropriately and to cease from these dishonest marketing practices.

1439,"I was sold a 150mbps speed with no data allowance restrictions, no contract, and billed at $48.99 per month with a $50 deposit. I am only receiving 50mbps and being told that I only have a 50mbps service and that the 150mbps speed isn't available in my area. I was offered 105mbps speed with a price increase to $89.99. I was informed by the rep, Robert (1800-219-5520 ext 8377) and his supervisor Shirley that all of this info was accurate and that this call IS being recorded. I am offended at the run-around I have been given and the failure to accurately address this issue. I expect 150mbps or as close to it as possible for $48.99 as I was sold and agreed to. I also have charges on my account detailing an installation for 6/12/15 when I explicitly stated i would self install as I did. There are also charges for tv service install when all I ordered was internet. Other representatives are confused as to why I am being transferred there and have stated that the account was setup completely wrong.

1442,"I have been contacting comcast since december 2014 in a issue related to my cable and internet. My internet and cable would cut off at the same multiple times a day. when i called to report it in dec i was told it was because i had a pass due balance on my bill. so i paid my bill.
 then i called in Jan for the same problem and they stated it was an outage in the area, i was given this response up until Feb. then at the end of Feb a tech finally came out admitted it was a problem however did not fix it. since then 2 additional techs came out. i was charged for one of the visits.
 i was told that because i had the problem since dec i would get a credit to my account, which never occurred. i did get a credit for the tech coming out however that is small in relation to the whole situation. In addition to that i had to call and make that request and state to them there comcast customer guarantee.
 friday i was informed about the customer guarantee ""We will resolve routine issues in one visit or we'll credit you $20* or give you a free premium channel for three months. After the first visit to your home, if we do not satisfactorily complete installation or can’t resolve a routine issue, we will credit you $20* or give you a free premium channel for three months. Additionally, we won’t charge you for a service visit that results from a Comcast equipment or network problem.""
 i called on friday and requested the premium channel which i did not get. called back sunday and the issue was still not resolved after i spoke with a supervisor and this time i was told i would jut be given a 20$ credit
 i have been paying my bill since dec and received a poor quality of service. i have been calling on a regular basis about my issue and i have gotten noting in return. all i wanted was premium channel and i could not even get that. I was promised a credit for the months that i called because no one did anything about the issue however that did not occur. In addition when i called to inquire about what was promised they told me that would not be happening. The problem with my internet and cable was fixed that last week of March, i believe the 30th. I had been calling about the problem since Dec 27 2014

1444,"I moved into a new home at the end of March. Since then I have had 7 different calls with Comcast
 because they have not been able to configure what I ordered.
 I originally ordered 25mbps internet and basic cable for 39.99 per month. After several attempts to
 hook it up, they finally did. However they then billed me $49.99 so I called to have them fix.
 Instead of actually fixing the problem, they reduced the internet speed to 5mbps to lower the price.
 This is not that I wanted.
 I called back to explain and was told the 39.99 deal isn't anywhere in their system and they can't
 honor it. I have the printout confirming this and offered to email or fax it to them but they refused to
 look at it.
 After being bounced back between 5 different people and calling back the next day, I finally talked to
 a lady who offered to give me 25mbps internet only (I didn't really need the TV) for 29.99.
 Again, they charged me for more than this on my last bill and when I use multiple speed test tools, the
 connection is always in the 5-9 mbps range.
 I am so frustrated and thought it would be a simple order where they would have given me what I
 ordered. Any help you can provide with this unending nightmare is appreciated."
1445,"At May 19, the internet of my home didn't work. I called the service of Comcast, they told me that
 somebody Will call me in 4 to 8 hours. But after 48hours no person contacted me and to fix the
 internet. Then at May 21, I went to the local office in Maywood, IL. They told me somebody will
 contact me at same day, but no one contact me. I went to the same service office at May 22 they
 told me they have scheduled to fix it at May 23. At May 23, there still no person contact me.

1452,"I have had various issues with Comcast since signing up earlier this year. I have been given false, misleading, and inaccurate information by customer service. When moving to a new address, I had an incredibly difficult time transferring my service. As a result of the aforementioned issues, now there are billing discrepancies that have not been resolved.
 On top of these issues, I have repeatedly had calls to customer service drop in the middle of the call, I have had calls disconnected by customer service reps, and most recently, when attempting to reset my account password through an online chat, the rep abruptly ended my online chat before my password was reset. My phone did not cause these problems, as I have had no similar issues with any other service, ever. At this time I am unable to access my account to even check on the bill or the status. Also, I have not received a paper statement at my new address, despite having moved and updated Comcast 2 months ago.
 Initially, when I inquired about transferring my internet service to my new address, I was told that my service could be transferred by the next day. I specifically stated that I needed the next day availability, otherwise I would delay making the request. The customer service rep confirmed that I would have next day availability, and I simply needed to call the phone number he provided from my new address the following day. When I called the number as instructed, I was told that service was not available at my new address, and I would need to wait 2 weeks for a technician to come to the house. Since this was not as promised, I called back to Comcast multiple times and requested to have an expedited service call. Eventually, I was transferred to a manager that told me I would be placed on the local technician's priority list. Despite being placed on this list, no one came to my house until almost two weeks after moving. I was not offered a reduction in my bill during the delay, even though I had an existing contract.
 When I contacted Comcast regarding the delay in service transfer, I was promised a discount on my bill. However, I never received a bill or statement to reflect the discount. Then, approximately two weeks ago, my internet service was interrupted due to a missing/past due payment. I called to inquire, and Comcast's automated system said I had a past due balance of ~$170.00. When I spoke to a representative, I was told my past due balance was ~$65.00, and I did not owe any additional amount. I paid the past due balance of ~$65.00, with the impression that I did not owe more, which was confirmed by the representative.
 Two weeks have passed, and my service was disconnected again due to an unpaid bill. I have still not received any statements. When calling Comcast today, I received two different past due amounts. I do not know which one is correct, as I have not received statements or bills, and I am
 unable to log-in to my online account. When attempting to reset my online password, the representative ended the chat session prior to resolving my password reset.
 At this point, I don't believe I have been treated fairly as a customer. Any attempts on my part to resolve or rectify the situation have been met with misleading or false information. Accessibility has been difficult, and at times impossible, both because of technical issues, misinformation from representatives, and the non-receipt of my statements. I am completely dissatisfied with Comcast's service, yet I have very few viable internet alternatives in my area. I am resigned to attempt to resolve this matter through submitting this complaint.

1453,"In April 2015 I canceled my account with Comcast and confirmed this with a representative online and
 in person. Then I received a bill for $31.64 from 5/18/15 and when I contacted comcast support, they
 said I must call their collections department. My account was closed and they just decided to add on
 a charge after I confirmed multiple times it was completely closed. This is extremely illegal and should
 not be allowed to happen."
1454,"Comcast Xfinity has a horrible reputation within our community and every single interaction I have with them reinforces why. They are dishonest, unorganized and seem to lack any accountability at all. I scheduled an installation for internet and tv at my new home and Comcast said they would be coming within a 7:30-8:00am window. I took the day off of work for this and waited in the living room eating breakfast in silence so as to not to miss Comcast when they came to the door. Comcast never came during this window. I called Comcast around 9am asking if they were still coming and they said that someone had already come at 8am but no one answered the door. This is impossible because I was sitting in the kitchen which is right next to the front door the entire time. No one came, no one knocked and no one rang the door bell. I confirmed the address with them as being my new address at and they said that they didn't know what had happened but that someone would now come between 9-12pm. At 11am outside my window there was a Comcast van sitting in front of my house with a driver inside so I opened my front door and said hi to the driver in his van. The driver (Dan) said that he wasn't assigned to my house and couldn't help me and that I needed to call 1800xfinity to get a ticket number. I explained that I had already called several times and already had a ticket number and had been waiting for someone since 7:30am. He told me that since the house I lived in was a pretty easy job with all the wiring already set up, he didn't know why someone would just say they had knocked and drive away. He said he couldn't help me even though he was sitting outside my house and he left. I waited in my living room from 9-12pm and no one came. I called Comcast again at 12:00pm to ask why no one came and they confidently assured me that someone would be coming in 15 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later no one had come. I called Comcast again and they said that someone came at 1:00pm and that I didn't answer the door. This is 100% false as I was sitting in my living room in silence by the front door waiting for Comcast to come. I called Comcast several more times, got hung up on several times, put on hold by many people and refused service. I was told that it was my fault that I didn't answer the door. However, Comcast never came! They never knocked on the door. They never rang the door bell. They never called me! And 8 hours later I'm still sitting in my living room waiting for someone to come. On my 7th call to Comcast today I spoke with Hunter - operator ID #DAME0313. I explained all of the above to him and he again assured me that he was putting in an expedited request and that someone would be coming in 20 minutes. 1 hour later and I no one has come or called me. I called Comcast again and they didn't know who I was so I gave them my ticket number and they weren't able to locate my ticket number. I have called Comcast 8 times today and no one is willing to help me or follow through with an expedited request. No apology. No compensation for my wasted time. Many of my friends in the Bay Area have had similar experiences with service professionals on the ground not being honest and phone operators not seeming to care.

1455,"Given the lack of infrastructure available for competition, I've been stuck with Comcast as an ISP for the last decade, in two states, four cities, and six homes.
 I have never had satisfactory service from Comcast in any capacity, from speed to consistency to customer service to price. Currently paying $50/mo for 105Mbps, and getting 3-5Mbps, with intermittent connectivity drops. Calling comcast only yields offers to send out technicians, which I'd be responsible for financially, who would run a litany of tests I already know how to do.
 Knowing the quality of internet service around the world in comparison to the service available in the US, I know this can, and must, be changed. As a public utility, it should be more reliable, less expensive, and more readily available to all communities. Comcast is simply too big to function. Break them.

 Hi
 Thank you for your submission. Your complaint provides the FCC with important information we can use to develop policies to protect consumers, remedy violations of the Communications Act, and encourage future compliance with the law.
 The FCC appreciates the information you’ve shared with us. It appears that the Federal Trade Commission will be better able to assist you.
 We urge you to contact that agency about this matter.
 Below is a link to the Federal Trade Commission:
 http://www.ftc.gov/
 As such, no further action is required by the FCC. Your complaint was closed as of today."
1459,"Comcast is requiring that new customers have a credit check or give a $50 deposit for new service. This is a completely lubricious practice that is unethical. Comcast's service is paid on a per-month basis. Moreover, per customer, the service is not expensive enough to warrant a credit check. Finally, credit inquiries usually negatively impact one's credit score. Only with a detailed description of the inquiry is a person's credit score likely to go unharmed. When questioned, the Comcast representative that I talked with said that it is not Comcast's policy to provide such a report to go along with their credit inquiry.
 In summary, Comcast is presenting their customers with a terrible proposition: either give up $50 dollars or possibly take a hit on your credit score. In both cases, there's a great deal of uncertainty. With the deposit, the concern is Comcast actually giving that money back. With the credit inquiry, the concern is a hit to one's credit score.
 This is a business practice that is detrimental to consumers and, in the eyes of this citizen, a direct affront to the FCC core values.

1460,"I have no choice for high speed internet than Comcast. Their prices reflect their monopoly and the only way I can reduce my bill is to buy a 'bundle'. I don't, and have never, owned a land line or television set. I had to buy a tv cable package even though I've never watched cable tv and my bill has got larger as the years go by and if I drop the tv cable service I have to pay even more for internet alone. I periodically call Comcast to remonstrate and/or to ask for a way to reduce my bill but I get nowhere.
 I recently read this piece and believe it to be true: ""Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.""

1464,"I had Comcast for a year without any major problems, but when I contacted them about adding phone service, they gave me a package price for internet and phone. The representative said that there was a bundled package with basic cable for the same price for 6 months, then I can cancel the tv if I wanted to. The representative said that there would be no installation charge as well. When I got my first bill, there was 2/$20 charges totally $40 on my bill. I called and explained to them that I was told there would be no installation charges. The representative said they would take care of the $40 and it would be reflected on the next bill. They instructed me to pay the difference at that time. The next month, the $40 was still on my account and now a late charge was added to the bill because of the balance owed. I called again and was reassured that the $40 and the late charge would be removed and to pay the difference for the balance owed, which I did. I now have received another bill with the $40 and the two late charges as a balance owed. The representative this time told me that I should have never been told that the bill would be taken care of or that there would be no installation charges. She said all she could do is take off one late charge but I still owed the balance of $49.50. I have received a disconnect notice at this time and she said that if it is not paid, I can be disconnected. This is the worse customer service I have ever received from any company. Not only did I receive incorrect information the first time, but the 2 more times I was told that the problem would be resolved. Now am facing disconnection, and I have done all I could do to resolve this situation. Please help!

1466,"I contacted Comcast customer service and spoke with a service representative in the Phillipines. I
 have been using the same program for 14 years and have never had a problem using the program at
 my summer home.
 When I spoke with the Customer Service Rep., he continually suggested that I pay more to receive
 better service. Knowing that I have never had an issue using the program (which requires a strong
 connection) , I suggested that they might be having a problem with their internet service. However,
 the rep was more concerned about the upsell. When I requested to speak with a supervisor, I was
 placed on hold for several minutes and then advised that no supervisor was available. I then asked
 to speak with a representative in the US and was told that wasn't possible.
 Next I went to the local Comcast office in Ocean City, NJ. I dealt with a representative by the name
 of Anthony, who I have never seen at that office previously. When I described my problem, he too
 attempted to upsell me for more expensive internet. At that point I suggested that they cancel my
 accounts with Comcast and he advised me that he could do something that the foreign representative
 was unable to perform and that the internet should be fine when I returned home.
 I returned home and about an hour later I had no problem accessing my program. Much to my
 chagrin, later that evening I received an email confirming a change in my plan with an increase for
 Comcast blast in the amount of appx. $12 / mo. Not only was this charge not authorized, no
 change in my plan was ever discussed (other than at one point the rep suggesting the upsell which I
 rejected).
 I was not attempting to use the internet for streaming video, but for a simple program which requires a
 strong signal. Last year or the year prior, I purchased a new cable modem which has worked fine.
 I believe that the service should have worked the same as it has for many years. The major problem
 is that no other company offers similar service in the area and living in a condo, I am unable to place
 a dish as an alternative.
 I strongly believe that the internet should have worked as always and that Comcast is simply
 attempting to rip customers off with the big upsell."
1467,"When we signed up for the bundle package of internet, cable, and home security. Comcast Xfinity didn't disclose the cancellation fee. We are now moving to area that Comcast Xfinity doesn't service so we don't even have the opportunity to transfer our services. They want to charge us $900 for cancellation. If we stay here we won't have jobs to pay for the service. We are moving because of jobs.

1472,"I have been notified by Comcast that I was approaching my Data limit on my broadband internet. Never once was I told I was in a market that had a data cap when I signed up for service. They will charge extra for going over the data limit with out my signed consent. This is the third problem I have experienced with their sales and service. How is it legal for company to charge extra for data when on their website it does not inform the customer of such charges? Please see below from the Comcast website:
 When addressing the data limit with the customer service at comcast, the agent just stated that emails were sent as notifications of the limit. This is an breach of the service contract I have with Comcast. I am not allowed to change how much I pay on a monthly basis; why are thy allowed to charge me more with out consent and agreement? Paying for services is the proper way to do business, but sneakily adding charges is not. We are lagging so far behind the rest of the world in all areas of the internet because companies like Comcast are allowed to run like a monopoly. There is zero competition in my area, they know I have no where to turn so they can do whatever they want.

1473,"The Comcast data cap is extremely unreasonable. A 300 gig limit each month in this day and age where more people are choosing to forego cable and satellite in favor of internet based streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. 2 people in a single household can eat that up if each watches just 2 hours a day. Television subscription services do not impose such a limit, so why should internet entertainment be subject to such an issue? Data is not in a limited supply. It is simply a method for Comcast to milk money from consumers who have no other options in their area since Comcast has ran out competition or bought them out.
 I feel that this issue desperately needs to be addressed. Consumers have zero choice in the matter. Even the option of paying extra each month for an increased data cap would be a slight improvement. Although the optimal option would be a return to the days of no cap. Please do all you can to discuss and or address this data cap issue.

I upgraded my internet service to a faster more extreme plan and despite my speed increase by x10 the cap is still 300GB. This has been going on for 1.5 years in the south.

1476,"Comcast has disconnected my internet service without any prior warnings. They are claiming it is for non-payment, though all legitimate charges on account have been paid in full. The internet account bills currently at $66.95, and this amount has been paid on time, (or the previous billed amount of $64.95) every month, going back at least two years according to my available bank records (see attachment). Despite this complete record of payment, they add a spurious ""late fee"" (currently $9.95) to the bill each month. I have repeatedly contacted the company about the erroneous late fees, and in my most recent contact (before the current episode) I was promised by a Comcast customer service representative that they would be removed from my bill. Instead of doing so, they disconnected my account without warning, and are now basically committing extortion, by demanding payment of the false charges, plus new made up charges, to ""reconnect"" something that should have been disconnected in the first place. I would rather not do business with them at all, but sadly they are a monopoly in this area. There are no other internet options available. So I have appealed to ""executive"" customer service support at Comcast's head office, and so far, they have refused to remove the false charges and restore my internet service.

The same goes for accessing library blogs, which is critical for me as a library and information science student. In addition, Comcast sells and tracks user information and web habits, and there is no choice to opt out, as there is no other internet provider in my area.

1478,"I moved my comcast service and was informed that they would install my internet and tv. I soon found out they lost my confirmation and cancelled my appointment I made 2 weeks prior the day before. I then was told I could plug in my internet and it would work. it didn't. finally a tech came out. and my line wasn't good. then a month of good tv and internet with a temporary line and my new line was buried. then the day it was buried my internet no longer worked. I had to wait another week for a tech to come out and fix that. apparently they didn't upgrade my modem and I had been paying to a nicer modem every month for the last 3 years. then just today I was informed I was being sent my bills via to an email. An email that was set up for me that I was not given at the time of install. so I was waiting for my paper bill. and apparently my old comcast account could not be linked. So not only did I have several weeks with no service and a had 20 plus calls (I was hung up on several times as well) to comcast I was sent to collections. I can't believe I have had this much trouble by moving. and poor service while trying to fix their mistakes. besides the countless hours I have spend on the phone just to be treated unprofessionally and poorly.

1480,"I currently have Comcast for internet service as I do not have any other option with where I live. I have contacted Comcast before when my rate would rise out of no where to try to get it down, usually to no avail. A year ago, when it shot up to $80 for JUST internet service, I called again, and I was offered a 'bundled' service with just basic cable, and their Blast internet service for $60/month for a year. Apparently my year is up on that promotion, as my bill has just shot up again to almost $80 again.
 Mind you, at the beginning of this process, I've always made it VERY clear that I have no need or want for their TV service. I do in fact have DirecTV for my television, and I'm quite happy with them. But, to my surprise, Comcast did not want to allow me to get a good price for just the internet. It in fact was cheaper to bundle the service. So, to save the $20 a month for 1 year...I agreed to do the bundle, and I specifically said that the box would never get used, that it was simply to save money. They didn't care, and I had signed up for what they wanted.
 I think this is completely unfair that I cannot CHOOSE to have the service that I want, without being penalized for what they think I should have for their 'bundle' promotions.
 I don't want to bundle their service. I want the internet, and that's it, and it's my only choice, or I would give someone else my patronage if I had the choice.
 How is it fair to punish customers, and make them pay more, for only a service that they want to have? Just because they want me to bundle my services, for whatever their reasons, doesn't mean I should HAVE to in order to save money monthly. I should be able to have a choice to have 1 service, and still save money. I think their billing is unethical and should be changed immediately.

1481,"Ever since I moved from my apartment to my house I have had nothing but problems with my bill. After Comcast screwed up my account and left my ""own"" modem that I bought with my own money on my old account I was told it could not get brought over and that I needed to lease one with them or buy a new one. I spent well over 10 hours on the phone with them, driving to a local Comcast store to resolve the issue and I was told the same story. Knowing that was a lie I spent the next 3 days without internet to get a supervisor to finally place my modem back onto my account. Once my modem was on the account they later found out they needed a tech to go onsite to resolve some line issues.
 A week goes by and I finally get internet, great right? WRONG. I get my bill in the mail and its SKYROCKETED. They charged me for a trouble call, they charged me for 2 starter kits for my internet which I never needed since I had my own cables from my previous address, I was charged for a cable tv starter kit when I never had cable to begin with. So again, I had to call Comcast and spend another insane amount of time to get resolved. Every time I called I was promised that the billing mistakes was resolved and I should see them reflected on my account in about 3 days. ALL LIES.
 So now two weeks goes by and I get a collection notice with a Comcast Technician at my house to disconnect my internet. After speaking to him about my issue and him ACTUALLY seeing that I dont have cable TV and why there would be 2 starter kits he said I needed to call to get it resolved that he couldn't change the disconnect call.
 So now I am out of internet once again. I spend additional time trying to sort this out to no avail. I finally decided that I needed to ditch the monopoly all together and suck up and get DSL. Unfortunately I cant because Comcast is reporting erroneous collection status on my account and ATT wont take me.
 Good luck trying to fix billing mistakes when your in collections. They refused to get me to the billing department. Comcast's automated system routes your call to their 3rd party collection company and after you wait 30 mins on hold they tell you they will transfer you but all they do is send you back where you started. After two attempts (3.5 Hours on the phone) I was finally told that the only way that I can get it resolved is to make a payment. I REFUSE to make any payment to a bill which is incorrect.
 I finally get somewhere and get connected to there ""We Care"" team. They apparently have resolved my billing issues, I never got a phone call back as promised so I have no idea.
 The monopoly for Internet Service needs to stop, no single company should own a section of city and claim it theirs. My work REQUIRES me to have internet, without it I cant feed my son, I cant pay rent. I lost a half a month of work and have not had one person from Comcast offer to excuse the WORK I had to do to get my bill fixed.
 I deal with enough stress trying to provide for my family and make sure everyone is taken care of. I am neck deep in my own financial issues I dont have the time to deal with silly internet bill.

Despite no change in service requested the price continues to rise to levels beyond what the non promotional service price was at the time of signing up for service($44.99). The promotional rate was $29.99/month, which would rise after 6 months to the non promotional rate of $44.99, it has now risen again with no change in service to $76.95.

 company to provide series in this area. I'm blown away that they are not regulated by the public
 utilities commission. It's 2015! These are not merely entertainment luxuries. I need the internet more
 than a phone. Internet usually works fine. Cable outages at least monthly if not bi weekly. Home
 Security has been down for a month, happy to provide records of proof. Yet the are still billing me for
 the services."
1484,"I started Internet service with Comcast in December 2014. I ordered service based on Internet advertisement; 50-100mbps for 39.95/month. When installation technician arrived to setup new service, my order showed 25 mbps, a discrepancy. The tech said not to worry, a quick call would easily correct this error. So, after completion of installation, I did call Comcast and described the discrepancy to my service speed and pricing. Initially they attempted to up-sell me, saying the promotion was no longer offered. I argued the promotion was offered at the time i placed my order. They said they would correct this issue. After several hours on the call and speaking to multiple staff members I felt they would finally do the right thing. Today, 4/4/2015, at ~12 PM, I spoke with Shirley #77027 at Comcast. The initially reason for my call today was in response to several voice messages I had received from Comcast indicating my modem was obsolete and that I would need to contact them to resolve this issue. After checking, Shirley verified my modem was still compatible with their services and to disregard the voice messages. So, since I was already on call with them I decided to inquire about my internet speed, which, to my surprise and disbelief, was still, or again, at 25 mbps. I complained about this and reference the previous discrepancy. Shirley offered to upgrade my speed for an additional monthly fee. I protested again. How dare they! Please assist me in correcting this unfair, unethical, and illegal practice by Comcast. I want only what I ordered and am paying for.
 Thank you,
 Mr.

1486,"I got bill from comcast for 107 dollars for 25mbps internet plus a modem lease. I have no idea where this number came from. I previously had a promo deal that was for about 39 dollars a month. That ended and they offered to extend the promo, provided I get HBO. I never got HBO but they upgraded my internet speed anyway and charged me over 100 dollars for it. I don't understand why. I talked to a customer service rep in person and all he could do for me was give me an HBO cable box and 25 mbps internet for 60 a month. I didn't want it but that's how it works at comcast, so I took the box and hooked it up. The guy said my bill would be backdated and adjusted immediately and I would have to pay 78.16 for some reason. A little more than 60, but I went with it assuming it was some type of adjustment. I still have the remaining balance left from the original 107 dollar bill however. Needless to say I wont be paying that balance, but I'm not sure why it's there after the rep told me to pay 78.16 and ""not worry about it."" Either way I was willing to suck it up and pay the 60 a month, but that never happened, and I also see Blast Internet on my bill which I didn't even agree to, and don't even actually receive on my speed tests. My bill has never been consistent with this company even when I was under their promotional rates. No one at Comcast has been able to help me without telling me I have to buy more to pay less for a certain number of months. It doesn't make sense that if I want the most basic service, I have to pay nearly 100 dollars a month for it, for 25 mbps internet. But if i want a slightly cheaper rate, I have to be responsible for taking care of their cable boxes that I don't even want. I wish I could contact another internet provide and switch, but no one else is available thanks to the monopoly of Comcast.

1487,"This is the first time I use them since I just recently found out that we pay every quarter for these services through our HOA association fees. In order to take full advantage of the program we have in place through the Eastwood Community Association, we decided to make the change away from DirecTV. We were out of contract with Directv and could have continued in that manner if we so chose.
 We are off to a very bad start with Comcast. I have spent at least 7 hours on the phone with their customer service trying to resolve the issues. As a new customer, I will tell you that this is the worst experience I have every had with any company. I transact with countless companies from small local businesses to global conglomerates. This is by far the worst customer service I have every received. In short, I would like to cancel with them and stop contributing to the program through the HOA payments. It is unfair to be treated in this way, to be lied to and taken advantage of, and to pay for services we do not receive. what is happening here can be simply classified as a Bait and Switch tactic that is convoluted by an unwillingness to engage with the customer to resolve the issue. I have made a tremendous effort so far to resolve this issue. I have encountered an entire team at Comcast that is unwilling and unprepared to help.
 I have been with them less than 30 days, and already have received 2 bills from them. Both of which are wrong. I refuse to ratify the agreement with payment until the issues are corrected and I am billed correctly for the services that were committed to me by Cora Williams, the customer rep that set up my account. There is an open ticket for this issue. It is: 027140150. My account number is:
 Here are the key issues I have that need resolution:
 -I called on 12/22/14 to set up a new account. I was told that I needed to speak with a different department about my account since I was a bulk account. My account was set up with Cora Williams on 12/22/14. I explained to her who I was and where I lived. I also told her that we paid for basic digital service that included a digital box and two small receivers through our communities HOA. She said yes, that she saw that on the account but proceeded to offer me other services. She explained to me that with my account, there was a package that would include the X1 package, phone and internet service. What she told me made sense, so I agreed to that. I asked her how we would resolve the credit issue with the cable boxes that I was paying for and she told me she would provide the X1 boxes at no additional charge. She also added that if I every needed the smaller receivers, all I would have to do is call and they would mail them to me for free. She did explain there would be a fee for the platform upgrade of around $6. I agreed to that. I asked her about installation and if it was possible to self install, she stated I could not and that were would only be a $39.95 fee for installation.
 (b) (6)
 I agreed to that. She told me there would be Starz and HBO included with the package. I agreed to that as well. After we came to agreement, we recapped the conversation with the facts she explained to me. My package was $89.99, Starz and HBO included, home phone, internet, installation of $39.95, platform fee of $6 and x1 DVR and 3 cable boxes included. I asked her to confirm this twice, just to make sure. We were all in agreement. We did not set an installation date since I had to notify Directv. I cancelled with direct TV and set installation up for the 11th of January.
 -when the technician arrived, He did not have the appropriate amount of boxes with him. He had to scramble and ask his supervisor to find him boxes. He found the correct amount and came back to install them. He did the installation and brought me an invoice to sign. I immediately told him that what was on the invoice was not what was agreed upon. He stated that this was simply a blanket invoice and that what was agreed upon with customer service is what would be billed out. He stated that it wasn't his job to get involved with things like that.
 • When the service technician arrived to install the machines, I had a router ready for him This is something that Mrs. Cole and I had discussed that I would source. She explained what I needed specifically and I went out and bought it. The product was in hand and I was told that my contract came with the router. The tech told me there would be no additional cost for it and that I could return the product that I had. A few weeks later, I received a letter that I would be charged a monthly fee. When I spoke to Janet at Comcast, she agreed to take this off my account.
 -Shortly after, I received a bill. It was not was agreed upon. This is where I have the issue with the Bait and Switch situation. I called immediately to get this issue resolved. My first call was to Ertrel at 8:10 am on 1/28/15 to the Virginia Call Center. He was nice but basically told me that there was nothing he could do. I asked him to escalate it to his supervisor. After some back and forth time on hold, Julie Anderson his supervisor came to the phone. She again told me she could not help me and hold me that I had to call another department to fix the issue. She gave me 800-934-6489 and asked me to select the prompt to cancel service and someone there would be able to help me. I called that number and they told me they could not help me and needed to transfer me to another department. I was transferred 4 separate times and each time they dropped the call. I had to call back and speak to someone new each time, explain the situation and then got transferred.
 -A couple of hours later I called again and had a young gentleman transferred me to the bulk department. I finally got to someone at 800-834-6757. I spoke to Kate at this number. I explained the situation again (for the 7th time) to Kate. If I could sum up the her tone and demeanor in one word, it would be ""indifferent"". She basically told me that what I was told by Cora was wrong and she could not do anything about it. This is called Bait and Switch. The sales team sold me a package they could not offer, at time of billing I was billed something completely different than what iI was sold. I asked her to pull the call log to hear the recording and to escalate this to a supervisor. She said she would escalate it to Nielsa her supervisor and she would call me no later than Saturday 1/31/15. It is now 2/9/15 and no one has called me.
 - My wife called to resolve the HBO issue. They reps told her that yes it was listed on her account. After 1.5 hours of back and forth, they kept telling her to give it a 1/2 hour and check. The service was never resolved and they offered to fix it with a tech visit at an additional charge. This should have been in place since day 1.
 • To date, I have not received any communication from Comcast regarding a resolution. I have called Janet at least 8 times and have left messages trying to find out the status. The only thing I have received is a letter that’s states a balance owed with no itemization and a threat that my service
 would be cancelled. It also states that I would not be able to call 911 in case of an emergency. This is a serious issue since I feel I am being bullied into payment for services that I did not order, or agree to. Also, using 911 service access as leverage for payment is unethical, especially since my wife is in her third trimester of pregnancy. This puts us at serious risk should an emergency arise.
 This is resolutions I need to see.
 -resolve and add back HBO to my package. If a technician is needed, the fee for that repair needs to be waived.
 -remove Install fee - Internet: $20, install fee - video unwired: $20, install fee - voice: $20 from my invoice
 -remove additional Xfinity TV services permanently from my account: $37.84 recurring fee

1488,"First, I will begin by stating that Comcast is the only internet service provider available in my area.
 Additionally, I am in Tucson, AZ, which is a “test market” for the 250GB cap for high speed internet
 usage. I subscribe to 50MB per second internet service (which is the fastest available in my area)
 and do not subscribe to any video services through Comcast.
 I’m writing to complain about the additional data charge for usage over 250GB. I use more than
 250GB per month because I stream video from services such as Hulu, Netflix and Google Play.
 I would like to know why Comcast has additional charges for video services through high speed
 internet, but does not have the same charges on video usage through Comcast video? I am forced to
 pay extra per month because I don’t use Comcast video even though the amount of TV I consume is
 the same.
 How does Comcast justify this additional fee for video not purchased from their service? I do not
 believe this fee is justifiable and I am writing this to formally lodge my complaint. I will also be
 submitting this to the FCC for their consideration."

1490,"I recently filed a complaint to the BBB about this. I had comcasts basic package, 3mbs download speed. But no matter what server i downloaded from i never got higher than 450kps. i had to contact the bbb because i couldnt ever get someone on the phone that didnt speak broken english. When they finally contacted me they sent two techs to my house. I can speed test all day long and get 3mbps download speed. But i am not paying for a 3mbps speed test I am paying for 3mbs download speed like they advertise. The techs couldnt figure it out so they just said that its because its not on their network. So there solution was to bump me up to the 25 mbps plan for 20 a month for a year. So heres the catch. IF it in fact was steams network cutting my speed to 450kbps then going to the 25mbps should make no difference correct? Well when they boosted me the the 25mbps plan my downloads went to 3.5mbps and thats what it caps at. Not once has it ever downloaded faster. I just read the article on the lawsuit against at&t. I thought you might want to take a look at the scam that comcast is running too. Maybe I am wrong but they do advertise 3mbps download speed not 3mbps speed tests. Thank you for your time. Any information would be appreciated.

1491,"Internet service installed by Comcast at my home constantly failed. Comcast advised installing business level service. I agreed. They uninstalled consumer modem and service,and installed business modem and service. However, they continued to bill for both. I could not correct the problem, because they would never respond to multiple letters, and constantly transferred my two hour long phone calls with them. I refused to pay for the terminated consumer service, when I was simultaneously paying for the business service that replaced it. Finally they fraudulently turned my name in to a collection agency in Texas. Several more hours of my time wasted, and the collection agency agreed Comcast was wrong. Then Comcast turned me over to a collector in New York. More hours wasted, and they agreed not to pursue the claim.
 In summary, this company runs slipshod over consumers, fraudulently submits claims, can't supply quality consumer internet service, fails to maintain customer connection, offers dismal phone support, resulting in simple problems requiring three hours of phone time to communicate with them, completely fails to answer all written complaints, fails to follow through on agreements made over the phone with Mr. Roberts' assistant, in the CEO office in Philadelphia, and should not be allowed to merge with Time Warner, since their increased monopoly power will allow them to continue to downgrade customer support.

1495,"I called to establish service with Comcast. they told me i had an outstanding bill and since it was so
 old they would use the amnesty program and waive the prior bill which was a little over $100. I am a
 senior citizen on a fixed income and cant afford cable but my granddaughter told me about internet so
 i can get movies. I was happy and started my service, $48 a month for service. They added the prior
 balance to my bill. i called and called and no one could help me. i paid my regular bill every month
 and then they cut my internet off. I cant get any help when i call. i really want to have the internet."
1496,"Comcast (the only choice in my neighborhood) has done the same thing for many years, I signed on and received a bundle phone internet and Cable the price for internet alone was higher than the bundle, after 9 months my rate went up 90.00 $ when I called they said I had a special offer that had lapsed, I told them I could not afford their new rate and when I scheduled a cancellation they found a new special offer they could give me, 6 months later my rate went up again - same drill I called and when I threatened to cancel they found another special offer, I've gone through this 5 times they seem to be jacking up the charges and hoping people will just suck it up. Are there no rate controls on cable companies ? Can they just set rates as they please and raise them at will? There is no competition in my area so the open market theory to keep prices in check doesn't work. Comcast behaves in an evil way, they just raised my Mothers bill from 135 to 260 luckily she has options and is in the process of cancelling comcast service.

1499,"I'm in a trial area for Comcast's policy of imposing a 300GB data usage limit on it's Internet users.
 After the 300GB bandwidth is met, Comcast will charge $10 for every 50GB we use for the month. It's
 an extremely unfair business practice and purely a way for them to get more money out of me and
 other customers. I'm an Internet-loving guy in his 20s with a roommate who is exactly the same, so
 needless to say we meet the 300GB limit every single month without even trying. They give you 3
 ""overage months"" that you can meet the limit without charging any extra. If they would have charged
 us for those months, we would have had an extra $230 on our bill for only 3 months, which is
 outrageous considering our Internet bill is only $45 a month. Streaming video content on platforms
 like Netflix & Hulu use a lot of bandwidth, and Comcast is simply trying to cash in since people are
 being smart and abandoning their cable TV plans for these streaming platforms that cost much less.
 They are trying to gouge their customers for money through this practice, and because of it I'm going
 to be moving out of my hometown when my lease expires since Comcast is the only high-speed cable
 option I have."

 part of Comcast. They are just going to send us some form letter I imagine and nothing will be

1507,Comcast has my bill messed up and is not providing accurate information to resolve it. THIS HAS BEEN GOING NOW FOR SEVEAL MONTHS. Comcast is THE most inept provider and has the worst customer service of any company I have EVER delt with in my entire life. THEY REALLY DO NEED TO BE FINED FOR THEIR lack of accountability. NO one in this entire company seems to have a clue. They are extremely difficult and frustrating to deal with. WHY has the FCC not done something about this company to help the public? Comcast CLAIMS they can do better; yet they CONTINUE TO offer THE poorest service of any company in history. They are hated by every community in America they service; yet nothing really changes. I need this bill resolved once and for all.
1508,"In the past month, I have logged roughly 9.75 hours on the phone with various automated services and customer representatives. I have called over 20 times (this is not an exaggeration). I have had 2 technician visits scheduled that resulted in no-shows. I was mailed 2 set top boxes and ""self install kits"" and then billed for the kits + shipping and handling charges when I never requested the boxes. I was billed for an un-returned modem and un-returned set top box from my old address, when I was explicitly told by a representative that it was okay to bring the set top box as I was moving less than 5 miles away. I also own and use my own modem, so I have no idea how the un-returned modem could possibly be validated.
 All of the above happened because of an incident during the month of May. I was without service (TV & Internet) for just under two weeks. I called the first day of no service and was told by a representative that this was due to a main line being down and it would be up the next day. When it never came back, I called in again and they had no explanation as to why I was told there was a main down because they weren't showing anything along those lines. Frustrated, I called several more times until I finally got through to someone who took the time to listen to all of the issues I was having, assured me that they would get the issue resolved, and credit me for the interrupted service. I was given a $12 credit but billed a ~$40 technician fee (who never showed up) and this is when those two previously mentioned set top boxes showed up and I was charged for them too.
 All that I wanted, was to have a technician come check my lines because my Internet and TV won't work at the same time. Only one or the other will work when plugged in. Having internet service is extremely important, as I my my living as a Web Developer and Photographer. During the two weeks of interrupted service, I was struggling to deliver a set of photographs to a client, as well as maintain contact and research with one of my web clients.
 My only other option is to leave Comcast for AT&T U-Verse, who will provide me with slower internet speeds (bundled with 370 channels) for $40-$50 more than I pay now.
 I spoke with Comcast today(6/23) about all of these issues, and was assured that they'd resolve them and call me back tomorrow (6/24). I really, really hope that the unwarranted charges are removed and that my services become stable. When we get down to it though, my time is extremely valuable as a contractor, and the 9-10 hours that I have wasted (not to mention the frustration and inability to focus after being given the runaround) is detrimental to my family's well-being financially and mentally.
 I reach out to you in hopes that customer service and support will feel more like service and support and less like oppression. I have no complaints about the individuals with whom I have spoken. I worked in customer service for 3 years, and I understand that they have limitations and that they may have something along the lines of a script to read. I, however, made it a point to check the accounts of every customer that I spoke to the following day, or whenever their appointments were scheduled,
 to ensure that my word was being kept. I wanted to provide the best service that I possibly could, and save the customers from feeling the way that I feel now. I want to remain a loyal customer and pay my bills in full and on time. I want to purchase their services that outperform all the competitors in this area. I want to feel cared for and valued as a customer, and right now, Comcast has me feeling alone, abused and dispensable.

 As an update to this complaint, I received a call from a Comcast representative today (6/24) at 1:54pm. This was outside of the 24 hour window that they originally gave me. They asked me to return the set top boxes they sent me in error to a service center. This is another major inconvenience and waste of time. I will have to work the drop off around my work schedule as they are only open from 8:00am-5:30pm and I am normally at work during these times.
 I don't understand these set top boxes can't be picked up by the a technician. They should be sending a technician to double check my lines to ensure I am getting proper service anyway, why do I need to inconvenience myself even more to clean up their mistakes?
 I want to receive the service I am paying for, I want the Internet and TV to work at the same time, I want the unwarranted charges removed from my account, and I want a technician to come out to check our service lines inside and outside of the property. I would appreciate/love being reimbursed or compensated for the massive inconvenience of this whole mess. I don't understand why this is such a huge issue.

 After being contacted by the FCC, Comcast finally reached out to me to try to remedy my issues. A technician was sent out on Monday 6/29. He informed me that our lines outside running to our property were in an awful state. He made several repairs outside and installed something on one of our inside lines to regulate the power coming in; I believe he called it a booster. He said that he couldn't check out inside lines because of the way my building was built.
 The Internet and TV are both working now, and at the same time. This is great news, and I'm glad that I'm finally getting the service that I have been paying for over the last 3 months. After the technician visit, I was contacted by a Comcast representative to ensure that services were in working order. I told her that services were working but I still had issues I needed to discuss. She informed me that she would call in a day or two after the adjustments were made.
 It is now past the two day mark and I still haven't heard anything from Comcast. I have a balance of over $200 composed of charges that should have never been charged to my account, and it is due in a week. I do not want to incur any sort of late fees or tarnish my reputation of paying my bills on time.
 I want the unwarranted charges waived, and I want some sort of compensation for the 12+ hours I've spent trying only to get the services that I have been paying for. 12 hours of my time as a contractor is worth close to $2000. My time could have gone directly into benefiting my family and my company.
 I'm very, very upset at this point, as I thought I was finally getting the support I deserved. This situation is the second abandonment by a Service Rep and the fifth abandonment including technician no-shows in the past 3 months. I wanted all of this taken care of by tomorrow because I have family coming to visit for the next week and I don't want to spend hours on the phone while they are visiting. I'm lost and have no idea what else to do at this point.

 Request #360595:
 In the past month, I have logged roughly 9.75 hours on the phone with various automated services and customer representatives. I have called over 20 times (this is not an exaggeration). I have had 2 technician visits scheduled that resulted in no-shows. I was mailed 2 set top boxes and ""self install kits"" and then billed for the kits + shipping and handling charges when I never requested the boxes. I was billed for an un-returned modem and un-returned set top box from my old address, when I was explicitly told by a representative that it was okay to bring the set top box as I was moving less than 5 miles away. I also own and use my own modem, so I have no idea how the un-returned modem could possibly be validated.
 All of the above happened because of an incident during the month of May. I was without service (TV & Internet) for just under two weeks. I called the first day of no service and was told by a representative that this was due to a main line being down and it would be up the next day. When it never came back, I called in again and they had no explanation as to why I was told there was a main down because they weren't showing anything along those lines. Frustrated, I called several more times until I finally got through to someone who took the time to listen to all of the issues I was having, assured me that they would get the issue resolved, and credit me for the interrupted service. I was given a $12 credit but billed a ~$40 technician fee (who never showed up) and this is when those two previously mentioned set top boxes showed up and I was charged for them too.
 All that I wanted, was to have a technician come check my lines because my Internet and TV won't work at the same time. Only one or the other will work when plugged in. Having internet service is extremely important, as I my my living as a Web Developer and Photographer. During the two weeks of interrupted service, I was struggling to deliver a set of photographs to a client, as well as maintain contact and research with one of my web clients.
 My only other option is to leave Comcast for AT&T U-Verse, who will provide me with slower internet speeds (bundled with 370 channels) for $40-$50 more than I pay now.

1509,"Every time we get a bill from Comcast they are adding charges, changing the terms, claiming there was a ""promotion"" and/or because we are part of an HOA, that we do not qualify for discounts offered to new or otherexisting customers on a ""regular"" contract. This is standard Bait and Switch and I am tired of having to deal with the deceptive practices. There is no standard pricing, everyone has a different bill, and it needs to stop. There needs to be transparency and the availability to see what they are being charged without having to guess every month what new charges will appear on the bill. I hate them!!!

1513,"Comcast ripped me off by stealing money from bank account without authorization. They took the
 money right after I already paid my bill. It was a ton of work to get the money back and I was given
 nothing but excuses and poor treatment. We then have a billing issue, and are being over charged for
 our services. While correcting the billing issue they change our internet services without our
 permission and then charge us more money to get the same internet back that we have always had
 and refused to offer us the same price even though it was their mistake. So we had to be charged
 more than what we were paying before COMCAST made the mistake. So we have been continuously
 mistreated, and ripped off, by this company."
1514,"I have tried to call and cancel my service on the phone, but the representatives keep transferring me and hanging up during this process - making it impossible.
 The account number is:
 In February 2015 I was moving from one apartment to another, in the same complex (same address). I called twice on February 27th to have them transfer the service, both times I was told on the phone that it had been transferred.
 Three days ago on April 7th, I called to request assistance in fixing a service issue where my signal to my cable modem was weak and seeing errors (barely usable). They told me there were two accounts open, one for an apartment 913 (old) and one for an 823 (new). I told them I hadn't lived in 913 for some time now, and advised that I had called twice in February to make sure it had been transferred. I have made each monthly payment as billed.
 A few things happened at this point:
 - Comcast billed my new account for 823 an ""Install Fee"" of $39.90 for an installation which never took place.
 - Comcast scheduled a service call for the morning of 4/9 which never took place.
 - Comcast left the balance on the old account for 913 ( a double balance, double pay).
 I talked with 10 people between 4/7 and 4/9 to try and resolve this issue, before I asked them to cancel all of my accounts on 4/9. Comcast told me they had done so, but would not provide me written confirmation that the billing problems had been addressed. The balance issue with the closed account that I didn't even live at also remained.
 I feel like I am at a loss to try and rectify the billing problem, and fear Comcast will simply leave the accounts active and then turn them over to a collections agency as opposed to correcting the issues - as the representatives I have spoken with kept disconnecting me when saying they would transfer me to a supervisor to address or telling me that I could not speak with one at all.

 Please take notice again of the account number, and the discrepancies Comcast continues to fail to correct regarding an service address of which I have not resided at since February 2015 and asked them to correct multiple times."

 After I received my modem and I set up the internet I decided to go over my account online to check my bill. My bill was $92.35, NOT $24.99 like i had signed up for initially.
 I proceeded to call Comcast to resolve the issue with my bill.
 I spoke to a lady whom was very friendly, but was not able to solve my issue. She told me that promotion was no longer available, and all she could do was cut my bill by $20, AND ONLY FOR 6 MONTHS. I signed up for internet for 12 months at $24.99 + $10 fee for the modem. They still have this price advertised on their website, and i am assuming they are NOT honoring it.
 All i want is my bill to be for what i singed up for, not the price they want me to pay. I do not think it is fair for me to pay that amount.

One rep even told me the data cap was required by law, a blatant lie. Comcast plans on charging me $10 for this every month, and they severely slowed down my speeds as well, which was not mentioned in the terms of use. I need this cap removed from my account, or I need a detailed summary of my data usage. Comcast provides no details.

This action has caused ATT to charge for a data cap in our location as well. Making it impossible for my family and others to enjoy video steaming websites like youtube, hulu and netflix. This is clearly just a way to make money and discourage the people TRAPPED in their contracts from using cable TV alternatives. It is disgusting and anti-consumer.

1524,"When we signed up for Comcast's Extreme 105 service at our house in Pearl, MS we were told there were no data caps on our service. Just today, we were told that we had a 300 GB limit and were only 30 GB away from our limit for the month.
 We've only had Comcast for a month and it is already a nightmare. This is 2015, data is being used for every facet of life all over the country. This has to stop. The issues are compounded by the fact that Comcast has a monopoly on high speed internet in our area, so they can get away with this kind of thing.

1525,"In 2014 my 2 year contract with Comcast expired, so via the telephone Comcast offered a 3 year plan for $120/month for internet, cable an telephone. I never received that contract per email. Pretty soon I had to call again, as Comcast was charging more than the agreed price. After going escalating to the office of the CEO the price went back to $120 per month.
 In November 2014 Comcast indicated that I needed a new cable modem, and they indicated that having the new modem would not influence the price. After installing the new modem, the price went up to $124.61 per month. When I asked Comcast why the increased the price, the agent indicated that it had to do with the improvements in the technology...the new modem oa.
 I tried to undo the price increase...no chance. Alas, in my area there is no second provider who can offer a similar package. So I am stuck with Comcast. In that case, I want them to honour their commitment of 3 years $120/month.

1530,"I fell behind on my account due to personal reasons so I called Comcast to get caught on my bill. I So
 I called them on Monday spent 40 minutes on hold and I ended up making one months’ worth of
 payments. I then setup a payment arrangement for May 31st to pay the reset to get services restored.
 Well Comcast ended up taking out $188 out my account (Which is one month’s payment and the
 remaining balance.) instead of just the one month’s payment. So I called Comcast back and spent
 another 30+ minutes waiting to talk to someone. When I finally got a rep on the phone she said that
 she saw what they did wrong and she was going to transfer me to someone to get this fixed. Well
 instead of transferring me I was hung up on.
 So I called back again and after another 30+ minutes waiting to talk to someone the rep I spoke with
 could not help me and no idea who the lady that hung up on me was going to transfer me to. So she
 then went on to tell me that a supervisor would have to call me back; well that never happened.
 So I contacted Comcast again yesterday (Tuesday) and the person I spoke with informed me that
 they were going to refund the amount they over charged me and keep the one month’s payment on
 file and I would have my payment arrangement still intact.
 Well today (Wednesday) my services were suspended and I called again and was on hold for another
 30+ minutes and the person I spoke with told me they would have to transfer me to billing because
 there was nothing they could do to help me; but instead of transferring me I got hung up on. This is
 two total times I have been hung up on and over two hours waiting to talk to a rep and the issue is still
 not resolved and my account was completely thrown off because of their mistake and no is willing to
 take ownership of the issue."
1531,"Moved into new apartment 3 months ago and found comcast was the only service available. After talking to a representative of comcast was able to come agree to a 50 Mbps bundle for 59.99 a month for 12 months. The first month the bill was ok but speed was only at 10 Mbps so I called and someone was able to correct that. Although internet still cuts in and out constantly the real concern was the fact that the bill for the 2nd month was raised to 69.99 per month. I have called customer service who all do not seem to know what they are doing, was very rude, and all they want to do is keep selling me a more expensive bundle. After going through 4 different customer service they told me the promotion I had when I signed up has ended and this is your new promotion. I know its only 10 dollars difference but I was told I was given a 12 month promotion for 59.99 and then to be told that promotion ended after one month and given this more expensive bundle seems very unprofessional and unfair.

1532,"Comcast charges metered access over a certain amount of data per month however there is no data meter on my premises to check our usage. The only way to check how much data we've used is to go to Comcast's website which uses more data so it counts against me to even attempt to monitor what we're using.
 Furthermore, I've taken steps to mitigate how much data we use per month yet our usage doesn't seem to have declined at all. I'm still being hit with overages. We've turned all of our streaming equipment down from 1080p HD to 720p HD months ago.
 If Comcast is to be allowed to charge me metered access to the internet they should be required to install a meter on premises that can be checked without counting against me. Ideally they should be required to provide meters that help identify the source of high bandwidth uses of their internet service (TV, web browsing, my son face timing, etc...). I've attempted to cut all of these out and it seems to make no difference.
 Most of this would be moot if there were actually competition I could switch to for internet service but since there is not (satellite and cellular are no substitute) they should be treated like any other utility which requires meters to be installed on premises.

1533,"Out of no where, and without signing anything agreeing to this, comcast has imposed a 300 GB data limit on my internet service and are threatening to charge me fees for going over. I have downloaded unlimited data since I signed on with them years ago, and the price has only gone up while my services is getting stricter and stricter. They are the only choice we have for high speed internet in my area and they are taking advantage of that to extort customers out of hard earned money. When calling about the usage, they say that most of the traffic is coming from streaming netflix. This is obviously an attack on customers that choose to use other methods of watching video entertainment. It shouldn't be allowed to continue.

1535,"During my most recent automatic payment for cable services, Comcast withdrew a larger amount of money ($161.32) from my bank account, than what was identified in the monthly bill ($131.49). When contacted about the inconsistency Comcast agents indicated that a larger amount of money was withdrawn because of ""glitch"" in the computer system, but provided no other explanation or frequency of occurrence. They added that Comcast resolved this issue by issuing a credit ($29.83) towards the Comcast account. They did not see the need to return the money directly back to the bank account.
 It is unacceptable to have a larger amount of money withdrawn from a bank account, but it is more egregious that Comcast returns the money in the form of a Comcast credit rather than the money being immediately returned to the bank account.

The second time, the agent again transferred me . the person I did speak to also didn't know what to do so she suggested I go the Comcast store. I went to the store and waiting for about thirty minutes while the very friendly associate tried to accommodate my request. After a while, I said I would come back. Instead, she said she would call when she solved the issue. that was 10 days ago. Today, I called and was harrassed by the agent because I asked for a supervisor. After 5 or 10 minutes he decided to transfer me. I couldn't understand him because of his accent. I advised I was not trying to upset him but I wanted to speak to somebody I couldn't understand. All I want to do is ad service and spend more money month with Comcast but they will not let me.

 I've returned your call on three separate days, but no response from you. How serious are you about resolving the issue. (b) (6)
 To add insult to injury, I thought I had the issue resolved without your intervention. I actually spoke with someone that understood the coding issue in your system that was preventing my order. She corrected the problem, or at least she thought so. She then scheduled an appointment for installation.
 The window for installation was 5 PM to 7 PM on the 5/6. At 6:45 I called Comcast to inquire about the technician's arrival as I had expected the technician to call by then. The person I spoke to said they would contact dispatch and then call me back. I never got a call back. At 7:20 I called back and was able to speak to a supervisor. At 7:45, I asked him to call me back after 8:30 as I had a meeting to attend. He said wither he or someone in another department would call back. I am still waiting.
 At 8:14 I did receive a call from dispatch but I was unable to answer the call. the woman informed me that she had received a ""ticket"" to call me regarding my appointment. She advised that at 1:06 PM the technician recorded that I was not home for the installation.
 Do you understand my frustration with Comcast. All of this is after the several weeks of problems I mentioned in my complaint to the FCC.
 does anybody at Comcast have any idea what is going on? Does anybody return calls? Does anybody care?
 There is a very uncomplimentary video about Comcast from the time of the Time-Warner merger on YouTube. It hits the nail on the head. It says, Comcast doesn't give a f@#%.
 Comcast and its customer service personal are proving that video accurate and in spades.

1538,"On March 18, 2015 I attempted to make a payment for $45 to Comcast via their online payment portal. This payment was declined. I immediately made a second, successful payment attempt via Comcast's automated phone system. This second payment was processed successfully and I received a confirmation number; this confirmation number was the only confirmation number I received that day.
 On March 20, 2015, Comcast withdrew the payment from my bank account TWICE. I had $54 in my account at the time, so the double withdrawal overdrew my account. Both payments were returned by my bank and Comcast charged me a $25 return fee for each returned payment.
 On March 30, 2015, Comcast attempted to withdraw one of the payments again. My account was still overdrawn from Comcast's first attempt so this payment was returned again, and Comcast charged me another $25 return fee.
 Also, on March 30, 2015, after realizing what Comcast had done, I called Comcast's customer service line. I was told 1) that the second, unauthorized payment would stop being ""withdrawn"" from my account and 2) all of the return fees that Comcast charged me would be refunded to me by Wednesday, April 1, 2015.
 After being told, on March 30, 2015, that Comcast had cancelled the unauthorized payment, Comcast made another attempt to withdraw the unauthorized amount the very next day. (Tuesday, March 31, 2015). My bank account was still overdrawn, the unauthorized and allegedly ""cancelled"" payment was returned, and I was once again charged a $25 returned payment fee. (For those of you keeping score at home, this constitutes the fourth returned payment fee that Comcast charged me.)
 As of today, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, I have not received any refund. Additionally, I called Comcast's customer service line, again, and spoke to someone named Judy. This time I was told that 1) Comcast customer service agents are not permitted to cancel payments that have already been processed (so whomever I spoke to on March 30 was either sorely mistaken or lying to me about ""canceling the unauthorized payment and refunding my money"" OR ""Judy"" was sorely mistaken or lying to me) and 2) Even thought Comcast declined my attempted internet payment, but somehow charged me for it anyway, I would not be receiving the refund that I was promised.
 ""Judy"" also refused to transfer me to a supervisor. Judy kept interrupting me. As a result, I had to repeat myself multiple times. It was exceedingly frustrating.
 I would like to say that this issue was ultimately resolved. However, the last thing that Judy told me was, ""I will see if my supervisor is available."" Forty minutes later, Judy hung up on me. I did not get to plead my case to a supervisor and I suspect that Judy had no intention of letting me.
 My hopeful objective for this complaint is to receive a refund for each of the four $25 return fees that Comcast charged me and promised to return. The double withdrawal was a result of a mistake made by Comcast, because of that mistake, my account was repeatedly overdrawn. I expect Comcast to remedy this.

1540,"I am currently a Comcast customer. My roommates just recently moved to a new house a few blocks
 away. We called the week of April 27th (prior to our move on May 2nd) to find out what we need to do
 to move cable/internet into our new house. We reviewed our service plan with your representative.
 After a lengthy conversation, and going through our plan line by line, he distinctly told us that our bill
 will be $134+tax per month. This was to include all of our current services, and told us that we could
 bring our current equipment over to the new house and plug it in. We agreed to everything, and
 thought everything was taken care of.
 On May 3rd, we went to our local Comcast center (Columbus Blvd, Philadelphia, PA), to pick up a
 new box, exchange a box, and drop off our modem (we purchased our own). When we talked to the
 representative there, she said there were numerous problems with our account:
 1. Our new address was not indicated ANYWHERE on our account. There was nothing on our
 account stating that our service was switching locations.
 2. She explicitly stated that the ""$134+ per month was a lie"". Our bill would be at least $178+tax per
 month. Also, the internet package we were told that we were getting ""didn't exist"".
 3. This representative told us that we needed to downgrade all of our boxes to basic cable. She was
 audibly cursing about the first representative, and visibly angry with what he had promised us, versus
 what was showing on our account. She admitted that the first representative cut corners, completely
 mishandled our account, and flat out LIED to us.
 The representative ended up not touching anything on our account, because she stated that there
 wasn't really much she could do from there. We took our new boxes and dropped off our modem. She
 recommended that we plug in our equipment, and call customer service to figure it out from there.
 We did this, and weren't surprised when nothing worked.
 So we call the evening of Sunday, May 3rd. The rep on the phone says that our bill will be ~$145+tax,
 and there is nothing they can do to turn our service on. We would need a technician to come out. She
 tells us to call early Monday morning, and that we will be able to have someone come out that day.
 For some reasons unknown to us, she would not scheduled us an appointment though.
 We call very early Monday morning (May 4th), and the rep tells us that we can't have someone come
 out until Wednesday, May 6th at the earliest, and nothing before 5pm until the weekend.
 He claims that he tried to activate our internet, but that it's impossible to do remotely. Even though
 Comcast internet/TV was ON in that house 5 days prior with the previous tenants.
 Now we have to take another day off work just to get cable/internet turned on, we still have NO IDEA
 what our bill is going to be. We have been told that our service is a different price from EVERY single
 person that we've talked to.
 What frustrates me most, is that every time I call, the rep just says ""It's not my fault, this is the first
 time I've seen the issue"". Well OF COURSE it is, because your Comcast NEVER let's you talk to the
 same person twice. Everyone is hidden, so there is NO accountability. There are no names or direct
 phone numbers.
 So now we will have to take our 2nd day off from work this week, and I am not at all confident that
 there is an end in sight.
 I've heard horror stories of Comcast's customer service, but I never full experienced it until now"
1541,"Misrepresentations by Comcast representatives-scheduled service calls mishandled; technician failed
 to appear two times in a row. Incompetent service technician-spent an hour plus unsuccessfully trying
 to fix internet connection-days later problem persists. In the process, technician created cable TV
 problems. We've spent hours and hours on the phone with Comcast...problems persist. We have 2
 accounts with Comcast and are billed $500-600 monthly."
1542,"Comcast is illegally blocking HBO Go from Sony devices. By doing so, it is breaking FCC's rule that
 stops permission for internet providers to block lawful content subject to reasonable management
 issues. Therefore, as a lawful application HBO GO should not be allowed to be blocked by Comcast.
 Attached is the proof in which is shown that Comcast is blocking the service because of business
 decisions instead of technical issues. If there is a reasonable reason to why the services is being
 blocked, or contractual issues, Comcast should come forward and clarify the situation to its

1545,"I spoke with a representative in early May asking for internet service to be disconnected as of May 31st as I was moving out. As my billing period was set to end on June 8th he confirmed that I would receive a refund for May 31st to June 8th and that my service would end promptly on June 8th. I also used my own modem, so I did not need to return any equipment to Comcast.
 However, I just received a bill for the following month, my service was never disconnected and I was never refunded for the first week of June.

1547,"Comcast has charged me $12.00/month for ""Blast"" high speed internet for over 2 years. I have complained and complained about the slow service. I was first told it was my router for my wireless network. I purchased a new router. Then I was tole it was my modem and to bring it to their office and get a new one. After one hour and 15 minutes in line I got the new modem. the service improves slightly but no where near blast speed and the network would drop in and out. After more calls a tech came out, but told me he couldn't change anything unless I contacted my alarm company since the telephone is also Comcast. Well it was too late to schedule a service with the alarm company so he left. I was charged $40 for the visit. I called back about a month later and was tole I should have a modem/router combo fro Comcast and they would send a tech to install it. They did however they would not connect my personal router to it, so I had to do this myself. They said I didn't need it once I had comcast's router. I told them I spent over a hundred fifty dollars for it when they said I needed a new one and I would like to have 2 networks since I was paying Comcast to provide internet and could set up any network of my preference. For a while both worked fine but never fast. I have my bill auto charged to my credit card and hadn't reviewed the Comcast charges for a few months. To my surprise, my rate went from $58.84 to over $100 then down to 70 something then back to $98. I had been charged for every visit and of course for the ""blast"" high speed internet. I call again and this time the tech had me run the speed test. This was the first time I heard about this. I was told Blast in my area should come in around 90 mbps. I was getting 38 mbps. Another tech was sent out and determined that because of my house construction I could not get the 90 mbps anywhere except the room where the modem is set-up. He left me boosters to try to install myself to my router which he suggested I move downstairs and leave the Comcast modem/router upstairs. Itried that and not only didn't it work, but it knocked out my router and after hours on the telephone with Comcast I have minimal service from their modem/router only, I unless personal router and have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Comcast. The last tech and I were disconnected and I never got a call back. I work from home and cannot have these serious connectivity problems. I feel like a Comcast hostage. I would like them to deliver the service I pay for. If other equipment is needed for my house construction than they should have the technical capability or don't charge my for a service they can't deliver. By the way I live in Philadelphia, in a corner property, not a rural area, so what is the problem. I am exhausted dealing with Comcast, but Verizon is just as bad and At&T is not allowed by law in my area. What am I suppose to do now. Please help. Here is the URL of my speed test I took tonight. It is slower than their minimum capacity internet service. http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/927034164.png

1549,"Used to have Clear internet service. When Clear was bought by Sprint I was forced to change my internet provider. Only had the option of using Comcast or Verizon. After research I concluded Comcast is better option for my needs. I placed an order to be delivered for shipment and installation the following week. I called to confirm arrival as I knew I needed to leave work early in order to let the technician into my apartment. I was told my order is confirmed. On the day the shipment was suppose to arrive I left work early, however, technician never showed up. I called to find out why technician never showed I get put on hold for 20 minutes and hung up on with no answer. I call back and after much back and forth find out the order was cancelled and I would have to place a new order and give my complete contact and billing info for a millionth time. They could not give me explanation as to why the order was cancelled. Was supposed to be transferred to Sales department but instead was transferred to Billing department. After another 15 minutes on the phone and with rude customer service lady was told she cannot place order and that I would have to be transferred to Sales. Growing increasingly frustrated I decided I would call back to place order at a later time. After calling again and placing the order I decided to opt in for pick-up instead of delivery since I could not afford to leave work early again. Had to rent a zip-car to get to the Comcast customer center which cost me $25. Not to mention I am still waiting on Comcast to honor the original quote of my order as the deal I was offered originally only cost me $39.99/ month not $49.99/ month.

1550,"Consumer is having billing issues with Comcast (internet and cable). Consumer received a call from Comcast today saying he owed $416. The internet service is spotty and jumpy. The technician that came out did not do anything and put his child at risk when he broke a lamp and did not clean it up. Comcast has been billing him for two modems when he only has one, which Comcast did credit him for. His bill is supposed to be $54.99 all-inclusive per month but last month he paid $80 and the previous month he paid $78. Prior to that he paid as high as $160. Comcast is charging him $10 per month for a HD cable box when he was told it would be free. Comcast said that if he does not pay $240 by 06/23/2015 they will shut off services. Comcast says he owes $416 because of a sequential late fee charge, when he has not been late on his bill. No matter how much he pays it seems like Comcast keeps adding more onto the bill. He does not usually receive consistent bills from Comcast and when he does get paperwork from Comcast it is a disconnection notice. He has not received any satisfactory service from Comcast, who has a monopoly over his area. Consumer is also not getting the 325Mbps that he is paying for; he is getting around 17Mbps. Comcast also never told him that he was signing up for a double play package; they told him it was a deal because they partnered with HBO. As a resolution, he would like Comcast to remove the late fees and get his billing correct. ***CTR359-phone***

1553,"we are Comcast customers since October 2014. Since that time we experience really slow internet speeds and constant internet interruptions. I had dozens technician appointments and they found out that outside lines should be changed. That's the reason we can not get steady signal. As Comcast do not do that there technicians filed some report to there subcontractors. These guys showed up several times but still did not run new line. Every time they do not have required tools, cables etc. and promises to come back next day. last time I saw them months ago, they said they will be back Monday,cause now they do not have required cable and tools, and never come back. My Comcast monthly bill is 120$ for 'BLAST!!!""(up to 100 mbps) internet and TV, but my actual Wi FI speed varies between 0,1 -15 mbps!! I can not get HD internet video,can not stream music through Air Play etc. And I can not get Comcast to fix this problem since January when they finally realized what caused a problem!Only promises,promises,promises!

On top of that, some of my time with them has been unsatisfactory, with my internet slowing at random. I pay for 50 mb/s. I know it isn't going to reach that all the time, but my speed tests show me maxing out at about 32 mb/s most of the time.
 When I first got the service, I payed for 50 mb/s and they have me a modem that could only handle 20 mb/s. All I got was a ""sorry"" after having it for about 3 months.

1555,"We recently attempted to transfer service from our address at Jenkintown Pa. . It took Comcast over two weeks to establish service, during which time they billed us for service in addition to a number of installation fees and related charges. As a result, our bill went from the original $99/month for Internet, Cable and Phone to nearly $900 dollars for service (only internet and cable) from April 15 through June 18, when it was shut off (for the second time) because of inflated bills which they have not been able to explain or resolve. I have spent hours on the phone with them and have been told that I would get a call from a supervisor on numerous occasions but have never been called back. They have refused to reduce the bill for the weeks of service we never had, and we were told that we would be provided with 3 months of a free premium channel due to the weeks it took to establish service, and that never happened. This exorbitant billing (3 months of service for $883) also came along with multiple slow internet speed and interrupted service as well as TV that did not work or had a poor picture. We have never once used the phone line that we were forced to buy as part of the original package, and this is just part of their overall unfair practices and poor service combined with criminally high billing that can't be explained and has left us able to work from home using the internet we rely on.

Without fail, my ""discounted"" promotional rates end and my bill increases every month. When I attempt to better understand why my bill constantly fluctates and trends upward I am led through a dizzying array of customer service reps and support analysts, usually taking multiple hours.

1557,"Last month my internet bill increased by $5 (total of $44.33). I called them to understand the increase and negotiated a $30 one time credit for poor service as the service did not work for 2 weeks during the year and required 3 servicemen from Comcast to fix. They initially told me it was my modem that was the problem. After spending $70 on a new modem I still had the same problem, hence I negotiated the $30 credit. When I called a negotiated the credit with the online person they did not inform me that my next month's bill was going to significantly increase. They wrote that my bill going to be $5 more going forward.
 This month my bill is now $65.95. I received zero notifications about the increase and no additional services. I only have Comcast internet, no other services are provided to me.

1558,"I recently moved to Philadelphia, PA and before moving I called comcast to sign up for their Internet package that gives 25mbps download speed. I was informed by a customer service agent named Tracy that this speed will be upgraded to 75mbps for free in my area on July 15th. On June 29th, after moving to my new apartment, while activating my modem, I was informed by Comcast this was not the case. They told me that I was misinformed. To me this is as unfair business practice as I was basically lied to about the service in order to get me as a customer. To apologize, they are giving me the upgrade to 105mbps service for free (called Blast-a $12 value) for the first month. However for rest of the year to receive the service I will have to pay the $39.99 for my standard service + $12 for the Blast boost. Since I was originally told I will be receiving at least 75mbps for my $39.99, I expect at least that much (the call with Tracy was recorded as I was told that it was being recorded for quality assurance). I think it is unfair to lie to a consumer to receive their business. I hope to receive at least 75mbps for 39.99 as I was originally promised.

 ment for Comcast ripping off customers"
1561,"On April 9th I ordered a service upgrade to my existing Comcast services. I've saved the chat session
 record showing the monthly price I was quoted and noting that there were no additional monthly fees.
 The order confirmation I received by email, however, shows a monthly fee $10 higher than what I was
 quoted, as well as an additional $3.25 monthly fee that was not disclosed.
 I've called Comcast to resolve this twice. The first time, the issue was escalated to their Customer
 Solutions Dept and I was told to call back during the week and given a confirmation number so that I
 wouldn't have to explain everything again.
 When I called back, they did not recognize the confirmation number I was given, and, after spending
 over 20 minutes on hold waiting for a resolution, I was told that they could not give me the rate that I
 was promised during the chat with the Comcast rep online because we were now on the phone!
 I pointed out that it was illegal to quote one price then charge another -- that this is a crime -- and
 asked for a manager. The rep told me that if she got a supervisor I'd be told the same thing.
 I informed the rep I would be filing a complaint with the FCC."
1562,"I have Poor internet reliability, i""m using cloud based software and voip phones, and when the internet goes down for sometimes more than 10 minuets i can't use it and the reliability/quality is so bad that my phones are useless. i have over 150 customers that i service daily from this branch. Comcast for the past 5 months now cant seem to fix the problem, the only answer from them has been they have to have there contracting department fix the issue and they don't know how long that will take.

1563,"I have had slow to 0 internet speeds since January. I have had such a terrible experience. The 1st time I chatted with an online tech I went through all the steps of resetting the modem, restarting it, using a wired connection and the entire drill. The 1st time a tech visitedin January and said it was just a problem in the area and it will be fixed. Left. Nothing changed. Chatted with an agent again, went through the whole process again of restarting the router, unplugging it, resetting it, then finally scheduled a 2nd tech visit. The online agent had no idea about the previous tech visit or what had already happened. This time, the tech apparently created a maintenance order because he couldn't fix it. And asked me to call him if it wasn't fixed 3 days later. Called him multiple times, no response. Contacted comcast online again through chat. Was again made to do all the steps of restarting, resetting the modem all lasting an hour with no consequence. I asked to look into the history of my account, but they had no idea what the techs had done. They just started from scratch again no matter what i said. Then a 3rd tech visit was scheduled. He again couldn't figure out what the problem. He gave us his supervisor's number Don Revel and told us we would be contacted by him. He never called us. We called him multiple times, left voicemails, no response. A week later I get a call from Don Revel and said he had emailed someone about it and would let us know what happened. Again didn't get a call back. Called him multiple times. He finally called and left a voicemail saying that the plant had been fixed and since our problem hadn't been resolved we should call comcast at the main number again. Chatted with an agent named Gaurav on 3/29. Again went through the steps of restarting the modem, resting it because he wouldn't look into the history of the account. He then said I should pay extra and rent a modem from comcast. I asked him why I would do that since every tech has told me the modem is okay. His response was why don't u buy another new one (mine is a year old). I told him to just schedule a tech visit since it was obvious he had no idea what he was doing. He told me it was scheduled for 3/30 between 2.30 and 4.30. I took time off and left early from work like all times only for nobody to show up. I called comcast again and was told no visit was every scheduled to start with. They rescheduled it for 4/2 afternoon. I again took time off, came home. Nobody showed up. I called comcast again and was told there was no one at home which was completely I lie. We even have a front desk concierge so it is basically not possible. And in this whole process there was multiple other times where I called when I was told a higher department would call me namely 4 times and I never got a call back. Its been more than 3 months and my problem hasn't been solved yet. My upload speeds are still 0 - 0.01mbps and I have to keep calling them with absolutely no follow up at their end. And very poor customer service with people lying.

Despite multiple inquiries, I was told that ""the system will adjust to reflect your bill accurately - you just have to give it time."" As I've waited, Comcast has charged me with late fees, shut off my service, and charged even more in reactivation fees. In total, I've paid $66.37 extra over the past 6 months, and now they're demanding $81.45 in addition to my normal $46.95 bill, or they will cancel my services. In total, Comcast has unlawfully charged an extra $66.37 and is currently holding my account hostage for an additional $81.45. Comcast should be required to report my bill accurately on each statement, and preclude the assessment of late fees until the statement is accurate.

1569,"Hi,
 I've been a subscriber to Comcast for quiet some time since Verizon requires a contract for competitive prices. I signed up for a promotional pricing which was only offered to new only new customers (which I don't understand why a service would be cheaper for a year and then $20+ dollars more after that) which expired after a year. I called them to see if I could get a lower price, and after some push back they knocked $10 off of my bill but then charged me $3 to apply this new price. Why would lowering my bill require me to pay them a fee? Comcast also advertises they have the 'fastest in home wifi' but when I first signed up and attempted to rent equipment from them they didn't have any wifi+modem combos available. How can you have the fastest in home wifi if you don't make that equipment available to your customers? Comcast also charges me $56 dollars a month for just internet access yet they have lower pricing available for cable+internet+phone. I don't want cable or a landline phone, a cell phone and neflix subscription already cover those needs for me. Why do I have to pay more money for less service? It doesn't make sense. Thank you for fielding my complaint.

 Hi,
 Last thing! Since Comcast didn't have the equipment necessary to provide the 'fastest in home wifi' as advertised I purchased my own wireless router+modem combo. Unfortunately being a working individual I wasn't able to return my rented modem for almost 3 months. Comcast charged me a rental fee + and additional fee for renting equipment I wasn't actively using. How can this be allowed? (b)

 (b) (6)
 Why would you ever charge a customer a rental fee PLUS a fee for not using the equipment? If I paid for a subscription service that went unused I would expect after contacting support that they would refund (at least partial, not in full) some of the fees I had paid during the unused time, NOT to be charged more for the unused service.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/1/2015 11:59:01 AM:
 Here's a summary of events to date that was sent to Mr. David Watson COO
 of Comcast.
 For the record, I have been a Comcast customer for about 15 years. I am
 currently involved in an endless, exhausting, frustrating and fruitless battle
 with Comcast to restore my services. As of this writing, we have been
 without all bundled services since 6/15/15. I have heard ""I'm sorry"" and ""I
 apologize"" enough to make me sick with no results. Here's a brief summary of
 the events.
 6/15 I reported that all services were out, cable, internet, phone. I was
 given an appt.
 for 6/16 between 2:00 and 5:00. When a no show, I called and was told that
 the
 appt. had been entered for 6/19 (not 6/16) but they would get someone out
 on 6/17 between 12:00 and 5:00.
 6/17 The tech shows up at 6:45 and determines that the main cable from the
 pole has
 been severed. He does not carry the equipment necessary to make this type
 of
 repair but places a call for maintenance to come on 6/18 to repair the
 severed cable.
 6/18 According to Comcast records, someone showed up on 6/18, surveyed the
 issue
 and did nothing to correct the problem. They also did not call in an SRO #
 6/19 We leave town for a family event. While away, we keep trying our
 phone number
 to see if it has been restored and it was not.
 6/24 We return to confirm that nothing is working and inquire why with
 nothing but lame
 lame excuses. Customer service says they will schedule a tech for 6/25
 between
 12:00 and 5:00.
 6/25 Tech shows up at 5:20 and says the same thing the tech said on
 6/17.....the cable
 from the pole is severed and he is not able to repair the problem. However,
 while in
 our driveway, the tech submits SRO#478931 and is then told that the repair
 will not
 take place for 15 days. This is outrageous.
 At 6:00, I called customer service again to see about getting the repair
 appt. moved
 up. I was told they would look into it and I would be contacted by the rep
 or his
 supervisor not later than the next morning.
 6/26 I received no call from anyone. I called customer service again and
 got another rep.
 who stated since this was a maintenance issue and not a tech issue she
 could not
 help me nor could she (or would she)tell me how to reach scheduling,
 maintenance
 or her supervisor. One more wasted dead end.
 6/29 Called customer service and spoke with David. Confirmed the work
 order and that a supervisor was to contact me that day. No call received.
 7/1 Still no contact from a supervisor or anyone regarding this situation.
 My business is at risk without internet and phone. There are no disasters
 here....no floods, no tornados, no hurricanes and no excuses.
 At this rate, by the time we have service restored, it will have been out
 for nearly a month.
 Our security company is screaming that they have no signal. No one who
 calls us knows there is a problem. Countless calls have gone unanswered.
 I've heard the many Comcast customer service horror stories and now I'm
 living one. I won't bore you with the details of the song and dance, scripted
 conversations I have had with your customer service people. I need to be
 wired up immediately.
 I await your reply.

1573,"I moved to a new house in Pittsburgh, PA 1 week ago and called a local comcast sales representative to set up internet service. I was told that the price for 105 Mbps (down)/ 25 Mbps (up) would be $59.99. The salesman then informed me that for an additional $5 per month, I would be able to get 80 channels in SD and stream those same channels in HD on my computer. I was told that I was not under any contracts and that I could drop the cable channels and streaming to return to the original $59.99 internet only plan. After trying and failing to get the streaming services to work satisfactorily, I attempted to cancel the cable channels and streaming and keep the internet only for $59.99. I was then told that cancelling the streaming would cause my bill to INCREASE to $78.99. The way in which the services are bundled forces the consumer to pay more money for less services and are artificially inflating my bill. Additional fees, including taxes on TV ($4.77) and ""Broadcast TV fee"" ($3.25) are also present on the bill, such that the true price of the cable addon is $5 + $3.25 + 4.77 = $13.02. These additional fees were not disclosed at the time of purchase. The practices used by comcast are deceptive and unfair. Comcast has not been helpful in resolving this issue.

1574,"Hello. Where I live, unless I want Verizon's ""High Speed Internet,"" which is anything but, Comcast is the only option for cable/fiber. When I initially signed up, it was cheaper to purchase a bundle deal than it was to purchase internet only. That is, it was cheaper to sign up for a cable and internet deal than it was to sign up for internet of a comparable speed alone. This is despite the fact that I didn't want cable in my package (right now, my cable box sits next to my tv, unplugged).
 Since then, my bill has been creeping up to the point where I'm now paying much more than I initially signed up for. And yet, my bill is somehow still smaller than if I were to sign up for comparable speed internet alone.
 This is crazy. Despite the fact that my bill for internet & cable has crept up over the past few years, it is STILL cheaper to continue with the internet and cable bundle than it is for internet alone. In my view, Comcast is exploiting its position as the sole provider in many areas to push people into packages they don't want. People accept because it is cheaper, but only for a limited time, as Comcast steadily increases the fee. It is not right that it is cheaper to purchase a bundle than it is to purchase individual services. And yet, this is what Comcast does and continues to do. I would appreciate any help that you could provide. Thank you very much.

1575,"We have been dealing with issues with Comcast for 3 years or more now and nothing is resolved. They come out all the time to check equipment and this past time brought new equipment and we received our bill and now they charged us for equipment when none of this is our fault. We should not have to pay for equipment when it is there service that is terrible. It is very frustrating when you work from home and the internet is so slow it makes it almost impossible to complete anything especially when you have the fastest service you can have. Then after a long day at work you cannot even enjoy the television because it is always freezing up. This is not the first time I have filed a complaint but even filing with FCC does not help. We do not know what to do anymore and when you pay the kind of money we pay every month it should be fixed nor should we have to pay for terrible service at all. We need help with this service immediately. Thank you!!

Why is this so hard to get fixed? It's been over 3 years now with the same issues n all Comcast keeps saying is that the guy who was here before him didn't know what he was doing? Does that mean no one there knows what thru r doing cuz they keep sending different guys! Why is it that when the cable guy shows up your system does not malfunction n works perfect? Then when they leave n get 10 miles away the service starts messing up again? Is this a joke? I have notice this over n over again over the last 3 yrs. Comcast owes my free years of service!

 My complaint is not closed they refuse to fix the system. They replace equipment in my house that was not broke n charge me 100 bucks s month for . I can not call in cuz u always get disconnected over n over again till u just stop calling back. My tv n internet keep freezing skipping n lost of services all day. It's so bad you can't use the Internet at all n the tv does not work when it is skipping or you change channel n it takes the tv 5 mins to do so. It's not just this house I own 431 Bocilla dr as well that comes off of a different box that gas the same problems. Do I need to hire my own guys to fix this cuz they can't. Where can I send you videos n photos to review? Comcast has a guy name Don who refuses to do his job n has been avoiding this repair for over 3 yrs. It was a Comcast employee who told me to call the fcc cuz he can't get Don to his job. They fired him for caring for the customer. I just want my service n bill fixed. That's it give me what I pay for! I had no problems with my service 4 yrs ago so what happen. How is it that Comcast has this market manipulated cuz we can't get any other service here except dish. It's been Dons office who is the one telling you it's close it is not close n it don't work. Also why is it that when the Comcast Guy comes my service works fine until he leaves, this whole thing is a joke. They left cut off cables in my drive way that flatten my tire n I have photos of the stuff. My wire laying above ground, my service next door is doing the same thing. Should I go n dig up n cut the main line all the way down the street so they have to fix it. Why can't they do their job period! I JUST WANT MY SERVICE REPAIRED! IS IT THAT HARD FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB? You come work from my house n use our tv n u will be flipping out. I guess I need to seek legal department bout Comcast n you guys too. Remember the customer is always right plus I have better things to do then f with this shit. They take advantage of the fact that there r only a few full time residents here n they don't care or want to spend the money to fix it! Now just get them to fix my service issues period!!!!!!! I shouldn't have to contact you for them to do their job. Again you can't call them cuz you will keep getting discounted n hung on. I spent 3 hours the other day n never talked to the right person n you have to start over every time they transfer you. Comcast has got to be the worst company in the world n I don't think they should be able to treat people the way they do.
 Good day

1577,"We pay for Comcast ""blast"" internet speeds and should have near 50.00MBPS download speeds, and 12.00MBPS upload speeds. For the last several weeks, we have less than adequate speeds, not much higher than 12.00mbps download speeds and 0.01mbps upload speeds. Spoke to Comcast numerous times, technician came to the home supposedly fixing the issues, only to have ourselves trade out Comcast equipment personally with equipment containing modem/router bundled together and Comcast trying to blame us that we installed it incorrectly which is not true. They fix the issue for 30minutes tops, then it's back to being slow. We pay far to much money to Comcast, and they are not holding up their end of the bargain for what we pay for. We are the second to the top tier for speed and we count on this service since I work from home. I've tried to speak with a supervisor and not one is ever available. This has been escalating over the last few weeks and it's frustrating.

 I am really upset. I had hand carried a copy of the transaction history of my checking account to the Infinity office in Bolingbrook Il. This was after several attempts to email the information to Lorraine Westbrook at Comcast corp office. She claimed she didn't receive them. I don't know whether she did
 or not. At any rate I drove to the bank and picked up a printout from Mary Spyridoulias a banker at US Bank and delivered it to Comcast (the Bolingbrook Infinity office).
 Today I received a call from Lorraine Westbrook saying that what I had sent was not enough, she needed the transaction history. What I sent her states clearly that it is a transaction history. I don't know what to do now. They still have my money and are saying I an delinquent. I really need some direction here....thanks.

 I have been contacted by a Comcast representative, supposedly executive management. The agent stated her purpose was to help resolve my FCC complaint issue, however, a series of emails, phone messages have been useless and another run around, time waster. I am asking the FCC to investigate, report and respond to the extraordinarily high volumes of complaints about Comcast's deceptive business practices, specifically adding non requested cable and Internet services to customers accounts, refusing to respond to customers and resolve billing of non requested services timely or fairly. Consumers continue to be subjected to harassment, intimidation, even retaliation by Comcast agents. (Service interruptions or 'missing' cable channels, slowed internet speed- not what is being paid for etc). I am at a loss to figure out why FCC does not aggressively address these consumers complaints about this company. I would appreciate direction to any other government agency that might engage this company to address the overwhelming issues and complaints.

 I have been Comcast customer for almost 10+ years
 all along internet was good.
 recently for last many months I have complained about internet disconnecting again and again (it actually started since I got the xfinity modem from Comcast, the earlier modem was fine) .
 on one hand they have been increasing the price again and again and I have to be on my toes to verify that supposedly 'promotional' period is not expired otherwise I have to call and ask for the price check
 and on the other hand my internet disconnects much so often I don't know what is it I am paying for .
 I don't know where else to complaint.
 Comcast provides the high speed internet that we need for work , so we are stuck but I feel they are taking me for a ride and someone should ask them to provide service
 I am also scared that after this complaint , I might be blacklisted by Comcast and it would further impact my work which depends on internet
 Thank you

He said that he has been trying to get the internet service hooked up however continues to get the run around. He said that he wanted a year contract with them and was going to pay $99. After the paperwork was filled out for this he was called and told that they could not offer him the one year service for that price but when he called back to discuss this with Comcast he was given totally different prices. He then wanted to choose the 2 year contract because it was cheaper than the one year but he is still having issues getting it completed. He had to keep sending mail back and forth to the company which took large amounts of time. As a resolution he would like the run around to stop and to have the internet service hooked up at his home. He would also like to receive better customer service when he contacts their office. ***CTR 354-phone***

 didn't fix it he had to get the same guy to come back and ther would be no charges. But they charged
 us another 70 dollar and cut our service I have to pay another reconnect charges. Tried to explain my
 issues to them and they called me a liar and it is what it is , they hanged up on me many times kept
 me on hold for hours and never passed me to the supervisors. They are always in the meeting and
 when we finally got the gold of one he told me if I don't like the service I should go some where else's.
 So far for less than a year service I have paid 520 dollars for crevice calls and equipments and that is
 not including the monthly service. Please help. I have 3 daoughters at home that are student and
 Internet is a must. Comcast knows that and they are reaping poeple off. We have no where to turn.
 Thanks. Regards.

 4 technicians that came out and the last Technician fixed the problem and I had the service back then
 came up other technician to buried the cable and since then I do not have services at all. Comcast
 keeps promising me that they will come out to fix the problems and I’m tired to wait for them. I would
 like to indicate that for the last 4 months the service is intermittent. I work from home and the internet
 is the most important tool to do my job. RESOL: I want to have the service working properly and as
 soon as possible. CTR-11

 Hello
 Thanks for contacting me.
 I answer the phone call from an executive officer from comcast, i believe the name is John at 561-

 voice mail.
 If you need more information about the contact I have with the executive officer from Comcast, please

1585,"My Internet connection is out today. This is perhaps the third or fourth outage I've experienced with Comcast in the last year. The modem has power but the connection to the Comcast network is inactive.
 I connected via my mobile phone personal hotspot and used the Comcast online chat customer service to try to resolve the issue.
 The first chat agent took a long time to eventually tell me he could only handle account password issues. The second agent refused to provide service and told me my Internet connection must be up because I could connect to the router by wifi. Anybody who knows anything about network technology knows that a router's wifi can function even when the Internet connection is down.
 This second agent refused my request to speak to a supervisor and eventually disconnected the chat without my permission.
 While on the chat I was able to speak with a agent via telephone who agreed to send a technician the following day.
 Since this is clearly another Comcast network issue I expect faster response time for a technician to resolve the Comcast issue.
 The quality of service provided by the chat agents is completely unacceptable.
 This poor customer service is why consumers are opposed to Comcast's acquisition of competitors. They are too big to care about their customers. Please don't let them get any bigger.

 waited for an initial bill to arrive, but never received anything mailed or emailed despite receiving
 other emails. Today I had the opportunity to go through the emails I had previously received and log
 in to my account. I have 3 unpaid bills that I was never notified about. The ""VideoBill"" emails that are
 sent out are misleading and in my opinion are a deliberate attempt to make consumers rack up late
 fees. The text of the ""bill"" email is as follows:

I neither want nor need phone or cable tv service, but I must purchase at least one these services in order to have internet through Comcast as an existing customer (new customers do not have this same requirement?!!). There is no other ISP in my area so I must deal with Comcast. Is this an area over which the FCC has some control? If not, can you please explain why this situation exists? It feels very much like I am being held hostage. Thank you.

1591,"Comcast sells HBO Go as a standalone service which I received as part of a promotion when joining the provider. I only subscribe to the internet and the most basic of cable packages because for some reason it's cheaper to get the lowest tier of cable with my internet.
 Personally I the majority of my streaming through my PS3 and PS4 and they largely get more use as streaming devices rather than gaming devices. The HBO Go app will authenticate against your cable provider credentials through an activation sequence that requires a code from the device and a web portal to enter the code and link to your account.
 When linking to specific devices the number of providers that will allow that device to stream decreases significantly from the number of providers that will allow access from a PC. This just seems wrong, how can I pay for a streaming service and receive it on 1 device but not another? When the same stream would be coming over either one?

1592,"I had my television with Comcast paying $74.95 per month. I called up and asked them what it would cost to add internet service. They told me with bundling that it would cost me $15 more per month. I told them that I would take the service. A month later, I got my first bill and the total was $132. I asked why it was so much, and they told me that it was government fees and taxes. I had a hard time believing that was why it cost so much more. After going back and forth with the customer service representative, I asked to speak to a manager. They told me there were no managers on site. I then asked that they have a manager call me. I left my phone number, but never heard back from anyone. I called back again and got the same response. I told them that I won't pay the bill until I get to speak to someone that has the ability to make decisions. Again, I didn't hear back from them. Two months later I was applying for a mortgage, and we found that they put me with a collection company and marked the account as unable to collect. As soon as I got this information, I paid off the bill. Since then my credit has lost 100 points, I was unable to get a conventional loan which is costing me an extra $200 per month, and I get rejected on any loan I apply for. All I was asking for was an opportunity to speak to someone about this situation, but they were unwilling to talk to me about it. I paid everything they said that I owed to them, all I want from Comcast is to have them help me restore my credit. I don't think it is right to not allow someone to speak to a decision maker in a situation like this. I've paid out more than $1200 for this situation already, not to mention the credit rejections I've had to absorb.

1593,"Despite my complaints directly to the company, I am still being billed every month for a modem rental that I no longer have. Over two years ago, Comcast sent me a letter saying that my modem would not work on their network after a certain date. The letter also stated that I would need to get a new modem to rent from a Comcast office, or purchase my own in order to continue receiving internet service. I was renting this modem from them at the time and opted to purchase my own modem from Amazon to replace it. The letter stated that since the modem would no longer be usable to them that I could either drop it off at a Comcast office or recycle it an approved electronics recycler. As I was closest to a Best Buy retail location, I opted to recycle it there and assumed I was done. However, my bill continued to reflect a $10/month charge every month. I contacted customer service several times and received a different story each time, some reps telling me it would be removed from my bill, and some even stating that I needed to mail the modem back to them or the charge would continue! This charge needs to stop as, by their own admission, the modem was essentially useless and worthy of recycling. I believe that I am owed all of the rental payments starting in December 2013 (when amazon shows my modem was delivered and I started using it) through today and, of course, the charge needs to come off of my bill immediately. Please help!

1594,"I consider myself a decently tech savvy person and have in the past with sheer force off will been able to keep my bill price at a still unfair but manageable rate.
 44.99/mo as compaired to their ""normal"" rate of **** you in the **** $63.30/mo. by calling directly to their retention center. Normally they have a couple deals but this most recent time of calling in there was just one and the push it obvious. The only possible way of lowering the bill was to get a bundle with tv which we don't want and even then it would cost more for these extra services. 49.99/mo for the first year which will then sky rocket up so they can hopefully offer us a not as good deal next year. Either way the cable box has never been removed from it's shipping package nor will it be.
 I would gladly switch providers but they hold a strong monopoly in this area for now and the only competitor doesn't even offer anything that is considered broadband/high speed which is required for any bit of streaming, gaming, or usefulness for work outside of the office. Sadly just south of us is a beautiful fiber ISP where I could get 33.3333 times the speed for less than what this greedy company wants for my current 30MB/s. I might even be willing to pay if they actually used the funds for something other than stuffing corporate profits and lobbying the government.
 Please put an end to this ridiculous over pricing.

1595,"Hello,
 I have been a customer of Comcast since roughly 8 years. I have been mentally harassed for the last 5 months by Comcast. In first started in February 2015, I had a dispute with Comcast regarding my bill. It was due to reasons related to my move to a new apartment and having different accounts. The result of spending 2-3 hours with them on the phone was below:
 1. All dues were clear.
 2. I would be charged $39.99 per month for my internet services (I had cancelled the cable during the call and had just opted for internet) for a speed of 6mbps to 12 mbps. If Comcast keeps call records, this would be crystal clear, as I had confirmed everything on the call. There was approx. $80 amount that was going to be refunded to me during my next billing cycle (which would have been march 2015).
 In April 2015 I had issues with my internet, and it would not connect most times. I called Comcast again and the result of 2 hours conversation was:
 1. They sent a a person over to adjust few things.
 2. I requested for the charge for the technician coming home to be waived off. This was accepted and there were no extra charge other than my regular $39.99 monthly bill. This was again confirmed by the lady representative overt the phone.
 In May 2015, I got another call from Comcast where I was told that my bill was way more (~$180 for 2 months) than it should have been (~$80 for 2 months). I was told that I had cable included in my connection as well which was weird because I had cancelled that back in February 2015. Finally after the conversation I was told that the bill would be fixed and I would just have to pay the regular $39.99 monthly charges.
 Today 23rd June 2015, I was called again and I was told that I had a balance of ~$450 for the last two months. This time around along with the unwarranted cables fees, they told me that I am charged an early termination fee (~$230). This was NOT mentioned during my call in February 2015 when the change happened.
 I would sincerely request you to intervene and help clear the unwarranted charges. I have spent over 30 hours in total during the past 4-5 months just dealing with problems created by Comcast for a mere monthly internet service. I have a family I need to take care of and Comcast has taken away my peace, my mental health has deteriorated, and my credit history has probably affected as well. Please help!

1596,"On 5/19/2015, in the zip codes of 33064 and 33062, Internet service was out for approximately 12
 hours from 10:30 am to 10:45 pm at our home AND business location. Upon calling customer service,
 the Rep seemed defensive as if this was business as usual. She offered to give me 1 days credit
 (about $1.25)that would be handled by billing. A company this size(and they wanted to get
 bigger?!)should have a solid backup for their internet, in that they raise prices a few times per year."
1597,"I am requesting $300.00 fee for not having service as I was promised. I had a technician at home, he
 informed me that I had the slowest speed possible; however, I was paying premium dollar for the
 fast speed for the entire year.
 The service was not rendered as promised. For last two weeks I have no internet service. Each
 month I was required to pay different amount. Nobody seems to know why. I was not receiving billing
 statement for months. I had to call Comcast and inquire about the amount to pay each month. I am
 a customer since 1998. The service is unacceptable. I cannot switch service I am in the condo, the
 TV service is provided by Comcast. No options exist."
1598,"On May 22, 2015, I contacted Comcast to check if there was service at a new office location, 1291 SW 29 Ave Suite C, Pompano Beach, FL 33069, and was transferred to David Driban. David informed me that the office I was looking at could have Comcast and we scheduled an appointment to have it turned on. Based on this information, I signed a lease, renovated the office and purchased cubicles, computers and other office furniture for the location. My initial cost was roughly $28,000, again spent based on David assuring me that Comcast could be installed in the new office.
 On June 1, the first technician came out to install the Comcast service but he was unable to install it because he could not access part of the building. The next day, June 2, another technician came to the location to finish the install. This technician informed us that Comcast was never installed in the building and a construction order would need to be placed to get Comcast service to the building. However, we asked our neighbors in the same building in Suite A what service they use and they informed us they use Comcast service. At this point, we know Comcast is available in the building for our neighbors but is not available in our suite. On the same day I attempted to reach David several times but he was unavailable and not returning my calls. I was given his supervisor's number, Greg phone number (610) 234-3614. However, Greg's phone was off and he has yet to return any of my voicemail's, even as of today. I guess you train your managers not return calls or handle any situations. It seems like the Comcast model is just say your busy and hopefully the customer stops calling.
 Later in the afternoon on June 2, I contact the Executive Customer Service with my problem, since no one would return my call and the general customer service could not answer me as why other suites in the building have Comcast service but I cannot get service. I then received a call from Jason, phone number (610) 234-3431. To this day, Jason refuses to give me his last name. He informed me he would look into the situation and have an answer for me within 24 hours
 On June 3 and again on June 4, I spoke with Jason to get an update of when the office would be ready so I can start my business operations and also so the 17 employees I have in limbo can start earning a pay check. As of the time that I am writing this letter, Jason still has no idea to a solution or how long it will take to get the service up and running. I pleaded with Jason to get me an answer so that I do not have to turn this over to my legal department. I made many plans and spent a lot of money based on the guarantee that Comcast would be running when I needed it to.

THE REP THEN ADVISED ME THE TECHNICIAN WOULD COME BACK THAT AFTERNOON BETWEEN 1-2PM. BY 1:30PM, I HAD NOT HEARD FROM ANYONE SO I CALLED COMCAST TO AGAIN CONFIRM SOMEONE WOULD BE THERE BY 2. THE REP NAMED BELLA (ID # 154268942) CONFIRMED SOMEONE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE THERE BY 2PM. BUT AS EXPECTED, NO ONE CAME. I CALLED BACK AND COMPLAINED, AGAIN EXTREMELY UPSET AS I HAVE HAD NO INTERNET OR CABLE SINCE THURSDAY AND HAVE WASTED SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY ON THE PHONE WITH COMCAST. THE REP TOLD ME SHE WOULD AGAIN ESCALATE MY APPT AND THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE COMING OUT ON MONDAY 6/29/15 AT 6:25PM. AROUND 8:45AM MONDAY (TODAY) I RECEIVED A CALL FROM COMCAST AND THE TECHNICIAN ADVISED ME THAT HE WOULD CALL ME BACK TO CONFIRM THE APPT AS THEY WERE BUSY. SEVERAL HOURS PASSED BY AND I HAD NOT RECEIVED A CALL BACK SO I CALLED THE NUMBER BACK WHICH TOOK ME TO THE MAIN COMCAST LINE. THE REP I SPOKE WITH TOLD ME MY APPOINTMENT WAS RE-SCHEDULED FOR 7/2/15 AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT. I INQUIRED AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ESCALATED APPOINTMENT FOR TODAY (TICKET # 029967665) AND THE REP TOLD ME SOMEONE TRIED TO COME. I TOLD HIM NO, NO ONE HAS TRIED TO COME AND NO ONE HAS CALLED AND THAT MY APPT WAS SCHEDULED FOR 6:25PM. THE REP PLACED ME ON HOLD FOR A WHILE AND SAID THAT HE WAS ABLE TO FIND MY ESCALATED CASE AND THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE OUT TODAY. I ASKED HIM TO SEND ME A CONFIRMATION EMAIL FOR MY APPT BUT THE REP REFUSED AND SAID THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. I ASKED HIM TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION AND THAT I NEED ASSURANCE THAT SOMEONE WILL BE OUT TODAY AS I HAVE HAD 3 APPTS BLOWN OFF AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY SERVICE SINCE THURSDAY. THE REP STILL REFUSED. SO OF COURSE NO ONE SHOWED UP FOR My 6:25 APPT SO I CALLED COMCAST AT 7:10 AND THE THE REP ASSURED ME THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE THERE BUT THEY MAY BE RUNNING
 LATE. HE ADVISED ME THAT HE WOULD CALL BE BACK IN ONE HOUR TO CHECK IN TO SEE IF THE TECH CAME. NO CALL BACK AND IT IS NOW 1:00AM ON TUESDAY. I AM SO FRUSTRATED WITH COMCAST THIS ENTIRE SITUATION HAS LITERALLY PUT ME INTO TEARS AND HAS CAUSED SO MUCH STRESS AS NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP ME. I CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FALSE INFORMATION AND I AM PAYING FOR A SERVICE THAT I AM NOT RECEIVING. IT’S POINTLESS FOR ME TO EVEN TRY CALLING AGAIN BECAUSE I KNOW IT WILL NOT GET ME ANYWHERE. PLEASE HELP ME.

To this day 6/9/15, we are still being billed for the old account, I have spoken to Comcast monthly since February 2015, to rectify this, and every month I am told it is taken care of, and every month I keep getting a bill that I owe money on the old account. In fact before I noticed that we are still being billed for both accounts, I paid them, so we actually have a credit/refund do.

 Your Ticket No. 330109 was served on your carrier for its review and response.
 Your carrier has provided the FCC with a response to your complaint. You should receive a copy of the response from the carrier within 7-10 days via postal mail. As such, no further action is required. Your complaint is closed.
 Thank you for your complaint and help in furthering the FCC’s mission on behalf of consumers."
1603,"This is the second month that I have received incorrect billing from Comcast for my internet service. I have had to deal with incorrect billing in the past, but I will limit this complaint to only this current instance.
 On December 7, 2015 I received an email confirmation from Comcast that my internet bill would be set at $54.99 per month less a echo bill discount of $5.00 per month on the internet plus package so that the bill would be $49.99 per month plus taxes and broadcast fees. I would have preferred internet only as there are no taxes, franchise fees or local tv broadcast fees, but that package costs even more that the one with basic TV. I do not even use the TV portion of the package as I have an antenna on the roof for this purpose.
 Last month, my bill inexplicably went up so I called Comcast. Called on Friday 5/15/2015 . Talked to two different people because of rate increase from $55.41 (54.99 – 5.00 eco bill discount + 3.25 broadcast tv fee +2.17 tax) to $70.84 ($ 15.43 increase)
 Was told that it would be corrected by Tuesday May 19th and the rate extended until June of 2016, but it was not.
 Called again on Thursday 5/21/2015 and talked to two more people again. They both told me they could not send an confirmation email like the last one I got in December for the locked in rate.
 I should have $15.43 credit on my account before I pay the May bill due on May 28, 2015. The rate should be locked in again at $55.41 until the June 2016 Bill. What actually happened was a package adjustment and a credit that netted the correct amount for May, but it still resulted in additional cost. The package is now correct, but the adjustment procedure cost me additional money ($5.67).
 Add to this the aggravation of the getting calls from my home alarm service because Comcast goes down for varying lengths of time several times a month. My alarm company does not see the ping from my alarm panel and calls me thinking the cable has been cut. I did not complain about this because it usually only happens three or four times a month but almost always around 3:00 A.M.

1604,"It was not that long ago that I filed a complaint against Comcast for the way in which they bill you for their services. I am a senior living on a fixed income. This is my tenth year of receiving services from this company. There has never been a year that I have not had to get with them on unfair or deceptive billing. When I complained the last time, they set my payment for 110.94 a month. After explaining for years, they know not only I, but thousands of their customers are on fixed incomes, therefore to take money from other financial obligations will most often result in utility shutoffs. I discussed the fact that I could not have them changing my payment in the middle of the month. They assured me my payment would be 110.94 until the promotion had ended. All of a sudden for the month of June, I received a bill for $133.68. The extra $22.74 goes a long way in my household. When asked about the increase, they stated I was being charged for not having an ECO Bill. The ten years I have been with this company, I have never heard of such. When I receive my bill, the only thing I look at is how much I owe. Their representative stated, all I had to do was go on the internet and signup for the ECO Bill and they would not charge the extra $5.00. My question is, if Comcast was interested in helping their customers, why not put a check box on their billing giving individuals the opportunity to check yes or no if they want to opt out of ECO billing and save themselves $5.00 monthly. This complaint is being submitted on behalf of all Seniors, Disable and the handicapped who cannot see or have the skills to use computers. I am sure there are millions. Comcast is profiting from the unfortunate. I am asking the FCC to persuade this company to make opting out of a paper billing so those who have limited incomes can also afford their services. When I suggested seeking services elsewhere, the representative stated, ""They all do the same thing."" How can this be fair? As a footnote, I paid the 133.68 this month, but if they do not remove the $5.00 charge next month. I may have to shut everything down and find another form of entertainment.
 Sincerely,

1605,"I have tried repeatedly to call Comcast and address the slow internet I am receiving. Comcast states
 that customer service is open 24/7. I have called 5 times and tried to live chat twice with no
 response. I have changed out the cable box the first time I started having issues. I am paying for a
 ""speed"" but am getting less than 1/2 of that."
1606,"I moved to the Savannah area about 2 months ago and the only internet available to us is Comcast. At first, I was fine with this because I had Comcast when I lived in Florida and was realitively satisfied with the service. When I initially called to set up my service for internet, I was never notified that there is a data cap in select cities. In fact, I never discovered this until I received an automated call informing me that I was 90% to my monthly allowance with 2 weeks left in the month. I pay the exact same price for service as my parents do in FL where they have no cap. I thought I lived in America. This is not right.

 In addition to my initial complaint: When we reached our cap, the service completely ceased. We were told that we had 3 months to exceed with no penalty. No service is a penalty. I called customer service 4 times that day. They'd get it to work and then it would completely stop after hanging up the phone. I'm very well aware they were throttling.

1607,"IMO it's not a bad business plan. It's a typical one.
 It's basicaly monopoly price fixing hand in hand with other companies. The large enteties have all sorts of cosy behind closed doors meetings to scupper us getting everything we paid for.
 They were not happy with how streaming should end the monopoly, so now they are limiting things like complete seasons via on demand. Now it's only 6 or se latest episodes on Xfinity on demand. Even Hulu are doing it now. It's all designed to make us pay more for a service we already paid for.
 I have paid so much money getting premium channels like HBO etc via Xfinity. I pay for Hulu. I pay for Amazon prime. I pay for PS plus. I pay for Netflix....
 What do I get? I can't even watch Gotham because of a closed doors, well planned monoply Hulu, Comcast, HBO, Amazon have to keep gouging us from all angles.
 I have to pay to watch early episodes of a season now. With all of the extras I pay for, this is scandelous. For early individual shows if i want to binge watch Gotham etc etc I CAN'T. It's enough to drive anyone to piracy. I'm so sick of it. And the prices!!! What is it? $3 an episode? From a network I already pay for? It's so shady.
 I tried again yesterday. Still cant run the HBO apps on my Firestick or Play Station 4. Xfinity is not listed on the supporting partners.

1608,"We have two home and two comcast accounts. When we are in florida, we keep internet at our Illinois address so that we can operate our security cameras in Illinois. In January of 2015, we noted that our security cameras were not working and were not sure what the problem was. We guessed it could be our security system and knowing that someone needs to be there when a service call is filed, we had to wait till we returned in May to address the issue. Upon returning we found that the internet at our Illinois home was also out and immediately called for a service call. While at our home, the comcast service representative explained that the problem originated from the fact that comcast had cut our service as there was a problem in the area and it was directly related to our house. We asked why we were not notified and were told that this is how its done. They cut it and wait for the customer to complain. The problem was where our house was connected to the main line and a quick fix resolved the problem. I contacted comcast immediately and asked why; a) we were not notified, b) that they had left our home without security cameras and c) why they continued to charge us for service we did not have. I placed a call to comcast and was assured that we would receive a $276 credit for the period that we were without internet and that it would be processed within 72 hours. Instead, I checked online and it was not there and we received a subsequent bill with an additional $9.50 in late charges. This prompted a second complaint and I was told by Iris, their representative, that our request for credit was denied as we did not report the outage. I informed Iris, that we could not be sure what the problem was, our system or theirs and it was not cost effective for us to fly back from Florida, rent a car, just for a service call as this would cost us well over $500. However, the communication breakdown was on their end when their service department failed to communicate to them that they had cut our service. I was then referred to Vincent who is a supervisor in the billing department, who said that he was authorized to provide a $150 credit only. This is the limit of his authority to make adjustments. He said the additional $122+ and the $9.50 would be re-escalated to the complaint department for a second review. I am appalled by the way that this has been handled. We are longtime comcast customers with their service at two locations. I cannot believe that it is their policy to charge individuals for service they do not have and would like assistance in ensuring that we receive credit for the full time that our service was disrupted due to their actions in cutting it.

1609,"I have a home in Port Hope Michigan. Comcast provides deplorable service. I can explain my
 multiple poor experiences with them but my concern now is when I try to find another internet
 company to do business with I am told that Comcast has a monopoly on the internet in my area.
 Century Telephone has lines there but when I called them they told me they are not allowed to sell
 service to me because Comcast has a monopoly. I have called At and T , Frontier, Century and other
 companies and all have told me they cannot sell me service because Comcast has a monopoly. I
 thought monopolies were illegal due to the very problem I am having. They do not have to provide
 quality service because they have no competition and therefore can treat customers any way they
 want. Are monopolies illegal and if so , can you investigate this situation?"
1610,"Reference Ticket # 132906. Ms Dominique Ramirez, executive Customer Relations (tel: 561-881-3239), agreed to refund back charges, dissolve my 2 year contract agreement, place my account on vacation hold over the summer, and reinstate full service at normal rates next year. But she required me to contact her personally to place my account on hold when I am about to go north for the summer. However, she neither answers her phone nor responds to her voice mail. It appears she intends to stone wall me and force me to remain in a two year contract to which I never agreed. Please investigate this matter and direct Ms Ramirez to stand up to the agreements she makes. How does a company stay in business when they treat their customers in such a shoddy fashion?

1611,"I setup auto-pay a while back because I travel a lot (4-6 days per week). I use my service while away (VPN) and while at home to remote into client's networks. This month I received a late payment fee (4/1 bill). Mind you, sufficient funds are always available and there was no issues there. So I called Comcast and they stated that ""their system changed my due date"" therefore resulting in a late fee because of the timing of the old due date and the new due date (backed up from 1st to 17th). I guess they thought I would not notice the late fee in the new charge (which worked fine and my account is now current with no action on my part). This whole ""system changed the billing date"" appears to be a scam to see how many customers don't notice the late fee so they can just keep the extra revenue. ($9.50 x however many millions customers don't notice). I would appreciate it if someone would step in and put Comcast in their place. They have been blasted so much in the media lately for their illegal customer service and other questionable actions but I've yet to see any investigation or fines or anything levied against them. Before the government lets them merge again and grow any larger than they already are they need to be shown how to behave as a proper company in a legal way. I've included both bills. Thank you.

1614,"After having internet service with comcast and receiving sub par service my fiancee and I decided when we moved we were switching to another company. Upon calling Comcast they offered us a retention offer and we decided to add cable on with the offer they quoted us at. Adding cable required a security deposit for the cable box so we paid that. A week later we notice there's still no service at our new address and I called comcast to see what's going on and find out that they closed our account down completely after taking our deposit. After hours of being shuffled on to other departments, and having to call back because departments were closed that they transferred me to I finally get a call back scheduled for the next morning at 9am. That call back never happened so after hours of re explaining what was going on Comcast then tells me the package I was offered doesn't exist and that the order was put in for a different package. They then told me I can either live with the other package at a higher rate or have nothing at all. They had no problem charging me the deposit but not only do they shut off my service afterwards but they also tell me the package is no available at all. That's theft, fraud, deception and they're lack of caring or owning up to anything is ridiculous. My fiancee works from home and we now have no service which amounts to lost pay. So there's also consequential damages. Would like to add that Stacey from the beaverton, Oregon location is the only person I spoke to with any sense. Not using that as a jab at the others, but if all of the comcast agents were like her, then this complaint would have been completely avoided.

 Correction, after calling back to verify everything was accurate today.. Come to find out Stacey didn't have the package ordered as we discussed very much in detail about. So as nice as she was on the phone, it just amounts to more lies and bait and switch tactics. I've waisted countless hours trying to resolve this issue to no avail. I get passed around department to department like trash. I wish i could switch services but there is no other options in my area for high speed internet. I feel trapped in a monopoly. Please someone help me. I just want fair service from a principle based company and Comcast apparently has no principles

1615,"My compliant is concerning Comcast internet service. I was having an issue with my internet being slow. I called Comcast customer services and was connected with and advanced tech service representative to help problem solve the issues. The tech services representative person said they could not fix the issue over the phone and a Comcast tech person needed to come to my home to fix the problem. I asked if I would be charged for this service and they said, ""no"". I asked them if they were sure and they told me it was an issue with Comcast and not my equipment. I made an appointment to have a tech service person come to my home and fix the issues. The tech person came to home and took some readings of my modem. He said the modem was being hit with to much signal, which is a common issue people have been experiencing since Comcast increased the internet signal output. I think he said they did this in December or Jan. He then put two metal things on the back of my modem to decrease the signal. This did not actually fix the issue and my internet was still slow. At no point in time did he tell me I would be charged for the service he was providing. On my next bill from Comcast I had a 71.50 for a residential trouble call.
 I called the comcast billing department and explained to them what had happened. The costumer service representative I spoke was named ALex. She told me she could only remove half of the bill, because it was a valid charge. She said she spoke with her manager and he said that all they could do was take off half of the charge and offered me free premium channels. Alex said that it did not matter that the tech service representative told me there would be no charge. It only mattered what the tech person wrote down who provided the service at my home. I explained to Alex, that the tech person did not at any point inform me that I would be charged for the service he provided. If he had I would have declined the service. She told me that did not matter they could not remove the charge and no one else would be able to remove the charge. Alex again offered to take off half the cost of the service charge and give some premium channels. She refused to give me her last name or the name of the manager she consulted with, for security reasons.

1617,"Until this morning (according to the person I spoke with over the phone), I was a subscriber of
 Comcast/Xfinity Blast Internet and basic cable.
 On Monday, 4/27, I submitted a request to end my service at my home and transfer it to my new
 home. The old service was scheduled to end on 5/16 and my new service was set to begin on 5/17.
 Everything, according to the woman who contacted me after I submitted the form, was set to transfer.
 On Thursday evening of 5/7, my internet service slowed to the point it was unusable. I contacted
 customer support and was transferred to technical support. I spoke with a woman named Tanya who
 could not verify why my internet speed was so slow despite several attempts at both hard and soft
 resets of my Comcast modem/router. She told me that my speeds might be slowing because the
 internet service might be ""preparing to shut down."" This possibly was related to the service transfer I
 had submitted earlier. She said the only option at that point was to schedule a technician visit. Since I
 work full-time, attend school online part-time (which I need internet access for - I had an exam that
 next morning), and was moving in five days, there was no time I could think of in which I could be
 available for a technician. I became frustrated and asked to speak with someone who could cancel
 my service.
 I was transferred to a woman named Kim who verified all the same troubleshooting information Tanya
 had a second time, then told me she didn't believe the service was slow because of the transfer
 pending. She insisted her computer was verifying the service was connected and working despite the
 fact it wasn't working on my end but offered no explanation. I asked for a billing credit but she
 declined to offer one, informing me that credits were offered by tech support and that I should have
 asked them for one. Deciding to do more research, I told her to leave my account connected and that
 I would get back to them.
 On Tuesday, 5/12, I had some time to work on this issue, so I contacted customer service again and
 spoke with a man named Scott. I told him the situation and he seemed very sympathetic and eager to
 help. He let me know that he worked for sales, but would contact technical support for me and resolve
 the issue, including credit for the time I didn't have service. He took my phone number and told me he
 would call me back in 10-15 minutes.
 Four hours later, I had not heard from him. I looked up the same 800 number I had just called that
 morning and dialed it again to discover it was now disconnected. I was at work, so I opened the chat
 applet on the Xfinity website to speak with a representative there named Irene. She asked for a ""ticket
 number"" which I had not been given by Scott. She asked several screening questions to the point I
 realized there was likely nothing noted in my account from my conversation with him. Deciding it
 would be easier to call and explain my situation, Irene provided me with another customer service
 number.
 Calling this number, I spoke with a woman named Cat who asked me all the same screening and
 tech support troubleshooting questions I had been asked by Tanya, Kim, Scott and Irene. When I
 protested, she told me she was ""required"" to ask these questions. Eventually, after several minutes
 on hold, she discovered that my service had been ""accidentally disconnected early"" due to the
 transfer. This might have explained the unusual slowing and stopping of my service just as Tanya had
 suggested on Friday. She insisted she would credit my account and have someone from the
 ""escalation team"" call me back by 7 p.m. that evening. This call was to reconnect my service for the
 rest of the time I was living at my old address. I confirmed the transfer was still scheduled to happen
 and planned to talk with them later that evening.
 Once home for the evening, I waited until 7:45 p.m. and did not receive a call back. Calling, once
 again, I was asked the same screening/technical support questions and required to answer them for
 the sixth time. A man named Max assisted me. He looked into my account and, after much more time
 on hold, told me that the department that could reconnect my service was experiencing technical
 difficulties and was also about to close for the evening so they would not be able to help me. I was
 instructed to call yet another number the next morning for a ""five to six minute process"" to reconnect
 and Max promised me that was all I needed to do.
 On Wednesday morning, 5/13, after six days without useable service, I contacted the number Max
 gave me and spoke with a woman. I did not note her name. She began to ask me all the same
 questions now for the seventh time. She also didn't seem to understand the situation and wasn't
 aware I wanted my service restored, then transferred. Rather than try to sort things out another time, I
 asked to cancel my service and was put on hold to be transferred. Needing to get ready for work, I
 hung up and called back about an hour later.
 Calling back an hour later, I spoke with a man named Nick who stated that he canceled my service,
 canceled my service transfer, and told me I was going to receive a credit of $65.09 once I returned
 my equipment. He also told me I had three weeks to return my equipment and that I would be getting
 an email letting me know my service transfer had been canceled. He also agreed to back date my
 account credit so I am not billed past 5/8 - the day my service officially stopped working.
 However, remembering past experience, I will not officially believe what Nick told me until I receive
 confirmation both my service and the transfer has been canceled and I receive my refund. The email
 to confirm the transfer cancel has yet to arrive (I am writing this about two hours after speaking with
 him). This is part of the reason why I would like to file an official complaint. I do not believe this
 situation has been fully resolved and won't until I receive proof.
 This has also been a cause of significant stress for me due to my pressures as a full-time employee,
 student, and someone in the process of moving in a few days. Time taken out of my work day, time I
 could have been doing homework or time I could have been packing to move have been spent on this
 issue, only to result in a service cancelation. This is inexcusably poor service in my opinion. At this
 point, I am not interested in returning to Comcast/Xfinity. I just wanted to share my story and have it
 on record that there is yet another paying subscriber who has been mistreated by their organization.
 Thank you."
1618,"I have complained about Comcast many times to FCC. YOU have done nothing and they continue to
 harass me. They refuse to live up to the agreement they made when I first contracted their services.
 The agreement was that I would pay $128/month plus taxes for as long as I had their service. Yet 5
 months later they tried to charge me more saying that there had been some sort of super fast booster
 thing on my internet. That was a big fat lie. It was also the first I had ever heard of anything super fast
 and the internet service did not change in speed when they said they stopped it on my service. Then
 they harassed me all of last summer by phone trying to make me agree to some new payment
 amount. I refused and have continued to pay them $130/mo because they will not bill me in the
 correct amounts. Recently they have started calling the phone number that is only associated with the
 modem using my name. In other words, they were impersonating me, which I believe is a crime, but
 apparently not when a big corporation like comcast does it. I reported it to you and you have not even
 responded to me. Now they are messing with my internet service. YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING
 to stop these bullies. I pay $130/mo to have internet and television service. This was the agreement
 Comcast entered into when I reported them to you before they even connected the service in my
 home. They offer new service for less for an entire year, so it is not like I am underpaying. YOU are
 supposed to help me. I just want them to stop trying to change the contract we have and stop
 harassing me.

 Today is Sunday, May 24, 2015. Comcast has shut off television service to at least one of my
 televisions. Another television has no remote control because they shut that off a few weeks ago.
 This is more of their harassment. Do they get to be bullies like this and you are going to let them get
 away with it? I pay every month the amount that was agreed to in October 2013. Comcast has
 constantly reneged on their agreement, harassed me in various ways such as those mentioned above
 and by phone. They have impersonated me, which is a crime and I want to prosecute them for it. Why
 won't you help me stop their persecution?"
1619,"Comcast is either unable or unwilling to provide ""all the speed i need"" with Comcast ""Blast!"" internet
 access. Advertised as ""No Buffering! No Skipping!"", yet Comcast consistently provides unstable
 access to various mainstream internet destinations."
1620,"Comcast is throttling our internet. I called and asked why they are slowing us down and they claim
 that because of FCC regulations we are over our data usage. I attached a screenshot from their
 website of our data usage. I couldn't find any FCC regulations that indicated there should be a limit to
 our usage so long as it's legal and safe. I also could not find anywhere on their website about a cap
 on data. Can you please assist?"
1621,"My bill went from 184.10 to 205.72 without notice. I have phone, TV, and internet bundled together but I can never figure out why my bill changes so often. I had signed a contract. When I call Comcast after much number pushing, I am connected to customer service and then put on hold again. My internet / email connection page is crowded with ads and it takes me forever to sign on as pop ups keep changing my screen. If I am paying for internet why do I have to wade through boxing match pitches, long lists of ads and entertainment tonight type stuff to get to my email? I am a 70 year grandma who just wants simple reliable service. thank you

1622,"I have been trying since 4/24 to get broadband internet setup in my apartment. First Comcast said they couldn't setup an account because the former tenant hadn't closed their account. Then they had system issues that wouldn't allow them to connect to my modem, which they verified was a supported modem. Internet is a necessity in today's world. Comcast has a monopoly in Portland, OR and since they cannot fix their system issues, I am stuck without cable or internet. I don't know where else to turn. I have probably spent 10 hours on the phone with Comcast and they can't help me!

To rectify comcast credited me one month, then offered to extend the promotion for two years. This hasn't solved the issue though, there is still no way see when my promotion expires other than checking my bill every month to see if they've charged me more.

1626,"Today has been horrible trying to speak with Comcast. For almost three hours on both online chat and phone, I was passed along, hung up on, and was told I'd talk to the higher ups. One phoned ""Loyalty Support"" Samara said she was trained to handle my situation, which she was not. I asked to speak to her boss she said ok and I was hung up on. As I researched more, I had more questions because things didn't seem right.
 I have been paying for the same Internet speed and basic cable for over a year. It's a specific bundle so I can download at a rate of up to 25mps and upload at 5mps. I have been receiving calls from Comcast since December 2014 saying I needed to upgrade my modem to take advantage of their upgraded speeds, I have not upgraded my modem because I did not have the money and still do not have the money. While this was happening, unbeknownst to me, they changed their rate structure. My prices have stayed the same, but I am not able to take advantage of their updated speed because I have not updated my modem. They did not tell me I can pay for my current allowed speed at the new lower current pricing. I have been paying unnecessarily for speed which my modem is not even capable of handling, yet they know and all they want me to do is lease a new modem from them. Their billing department told me ""how can she know what modem I'm using?"" and I told her ""your tech support has been calling me for months telling me it can't handle the speed so Comcast does know what modem I have."" I want to be reimbursed for past months which I was unnecessarily paying in excess. And, I want my current speed at current rates. I have been paying $70. I found one promotion for $50 which started yesterday and one for $60 which started in March 2015, both with same bundle of Internet and TV I have been using for over a year and both not needing a contract.

1631,"Good Morning,
 I have been a Comcast Customer for over 30 years, this shut off notice will shut off services to my internet and TV services, please investigate.
 I am going to go over my complaint in detail and attached is the shutoff notice.
 On Monday, March 30, 2015, in the mail I received a shutoff notice from
 Comcast, for $20.00 and the new bill in total $182.93 which $162.93 (actual bill is usually 156.00) is not due until April 12, 2015,
 my last payment was paid on March 10, 2015 in the amount of $161.00. Comcast
 bills a month ahead, this is not a delinquent bill. My bill is paid on
 time, every month a check is sent directly from my bank and we have been
 Comcast customers for over 30 years.
 In January, 2015, I purchased a movie from Comcast On Demand; ""The Judge""
 is was the only way to watch it, the cost was $20.00 which I paid. Later
 that month we had a Tech from Comcast come to our home and install new boxes,
 which we paid a $35.00 fee to upgrade to this new Anywhere box, so that
 you can watch taped shows on any TV in the home. At that time the Tech said
 you may loss your movie that you purchased, because you bought the movie is
 yours to keep forever, so if you lose the Movie due to the new boxes, call
 Comcast and have them credit you the $20.00 back to your account. When
 trying to view the movie, the movie was no longer available, it was gone, I
 called Comcast explained the situation in late January, they said they will
 credit me for the $20.00 as well as other movies I think 3 that were not
 ordered, but were on our bill. When my new bill arrived for February, 2015 the
 $20.00 was not credited, but the other 3 movies were removed from my bill,
 this was February 2015. I called Comcast again, they said they will credit
 my account $20.00.
 Yesterday I received a shut- off notice for $20.00 and the new bill, which
 is not even due. I called Comcast, after waiting on hold 22 minutes, I was
 told this is the wrong service area for your account, I was transferred to
 a woman in the Philippines, who told me I didn't have an account with
 them, she asked for my Social Security number 3 times. I refused to give my
 personal information and instead provided my account number, very shady if you
 ask me, as well as dishonest and scary. I requested a Manager, she
 continued for 15 minutes to say we can resolve the matter, I said how can you when
 you tell me I don't have an account. I was transferred to Natalia a
 manager in the Philippines, who again said we don't have any balance on your
 account, I assure you, your service won't be interrupted, I said I have a
 shut-off notice, she said Comcast didn't send you a shut-off notice, if this is
 your account number, I said yes, this is my account number, she verified my
 address, and said maybe this is another persons account? I then asked to
 be transferred to USA, I talked to a Chris-CS3 in NY, (I provided all names
 in initial complaint) this man said I am the wrong Dept, I don't have the
 authority to help you, I will transfer you to billing. I was then
 transferred to Teneiki in the USA, I asked for a manager in the billing dept, she
 stated I can help you, I said you can't help me, I need a manager, Teneiki
 said if you don't allow me to help you and give me all the information I will
 disconnect this call, I said I have been on this phone over an hour, please
 transfer me to a manager,. Teneiki was unprofessional, rude and very
 discriminative, it had been over an hour with this circus of calls and
 misinformation, I was angry gave my information and again asked for a manager. She
 said hold on, I waited 9 minutes, Teneiki said my manager is not available,
 give me your story I will help you. Again I asked for a manager, and offered
 to hold until one was available. Teneiki said this is your fault because
 you won't allow me to help you, I said I can hold, Teneiki stated she can
 not tie up the phone line to wait for a manager, and said I will have the
 manager call you back as soon as her call ends, or let me assist you. I stated
 I need to resolve this matter therefore I want a manager. Teneiki said in
 a very rude tone, I offered to assist you, click and disconnected the call.
 I waited hours and I never received a call from the Comcast manager,
 therefore I am filing this complaint because I have spent over 5 hours in
 totality trying to resolve a matter that Comcast did not resolve, they still told
 me they don't have my account or a balance on my account, yet I have a
 shut-off notice.
 A few years ago Comcast shut-off my comcast service instead of a
 neighbor's service, then wanted $300.00 to restore my service, I had to go to
 through the Comcast corporate office to have my Comcast restored and for Comcast
 to acknowledge their error. I want Comcast to acknowledge their error's
 again and credit my account, I would like the bill for April credited. I
 would like customer service to transfer me when I ask for a manager, not harass
 and humiliate me. My time is also important and valuable, this is time
 they have taken from my family and caused me undue and unneeded stress for
 $20.00 when they were negligent and their workers are incompetent. I
 understand customer service is rewarded if they handle calls and prevent escalation
 at the expense of their customers. As soon as Verizon FIOS is available in
 our area, we will be canceling Comcast. They have no respect or regard for
 their Customers. It is my hope that you can help me. If they disconnect this service I willlose my Internet and TV Services, this is not the responsibility og the LFA!!!!
 Shut off notice attached
 New bill attached, which includes the $20.00 fee and additional taxes
 Please call me with a status or questions

 to drop the line and have been happy with the service.
 6mo later, second tenant came who also use Comcast. Comcast tecchnician also came for the
 installation. The tenant was rarely home or was home when I am not. He left after a few months.
 In May, new tenant moved in who works from home and has large internet demands. I started to
 have trouble with my internet service. I do not have any internet service at all. Initially I could not
 understand it. I always work from home remotely after leaving the office or when I am on call( i am a
 physician) .
 After 2weeks of investigation that included nightly phone call to Comcast customer service reps,
 recounting the story over and over again to each agent i was transferred to during a call, I was
 informed that my cable is fitted to a splitter before it enters my apartment unit.
 I also spoke to the new tenant upstairs. When they turn off their internet/cell phones, I was able to
 receive internet without trouble. But when they turn on, I get nothing. They also told me that there is
 a splitter per the landlord.
 I query the splitter to my landlord who denies that he is the one who installed the splitter.
 Meanwhile, i found the site where splitter was installed. It was in the basement. It is a 3 way splitter
 which is unpatented. The upstair tenant takes up 2 of the 3 outlet
 I went to Comcast Store/service center in Wyomissing and request thorough investigation of the
 manner. The supervisor reaasure me that a full investigation will be conducted by supervisor
 technician but can not promise when it will happen.
 below is the picture of the unpatented 3 way splitter with no inscription of the frequency capacity.
 thank you for your attention and time.

1634,"I cancelled my Comcast service back in March. I had purchased my own modem on Amazon.com. I confirmed with Comcast that there was no rented equipment to return at the time of cancellation. I recently began receiving phone calls from Comcast about returning a rented piece of equipment. When I called to correct the issue I was told that the modem I have is listed in their system as rented. They told me the only way to fix the problem is to bring the Modem with the receipt into the nearest Comcast store. I told them the nearest Comcast store is 35 miles away. Its unreasonable to expect me to drive 70 miles to fix a mistake they made. I asked if they could accept the receipt via email/fax, or send a technician to my house. They said no. They will charge me for a modem I already purchased myself if I don't drive the 70 miles round trip to their store.

 no way of telling when the usage occurred even though they can up data my usage every 45 mins. I
 do not mind paying for the overcharges that I use, but when I go over the last day of the billing cycle

 This request was closed and merged into request #236263 ""Comcast Corporation Xfinity""."
1645,"Comcast is aware that they are the only high speed provider in our town which makes their ""support"" quite cavalier when dealing with customers, at least in our experience.
 Further, we only require Internet service but due to their pricing, we were forced to buy the cable tv service for a lower overall price than what just the Internet would cost. We do not want the TV service and I can, literally, count on one hand the time we've even turned the tv on. And a couple of those times were at the directive of their ""support"" (and I am using that term loosely) when we had Internet service issues.
 The only way to get information online as to what current pricing is, is by giving your address and once you do, you are not able to get their current pricing information due to your computer/user being recognized. You are forced to log in to your account and then they modify what is shown to you as available. Even when I attempt access via my account, their system tells me my phone number/ ss number doesn't match. Since I've had the same SS number since I was 14 and the same phone number for at least 6 years, I'm pretty sure it's being entered correctly. It feels like they are purposely hiding current pricing information and the only way to get it is to spoof your location/address/etc. using incognito and a vpn.
 Finally, we have been paying a 4.99 a month charge for what they call their ""service protection plan"" yet the last three times we have had issues with our service, they have claimed it was our modem (which it turned out it never was) and that we would have to pay them to send someone for service. Their ""troubleshooting"" consists of having you turn things on and off for at least 30 minutes then the say it's your modem.
 Comcast seems to have a system in place that wears you down until you go away and it's despicable the way their ""support"" is handled - how could our past issues always have been our modem when it turned out it was never the modem? A rhetorical question but nonetheless, a good one.

 Currently, we pay near $100 for 50Mbit. We normally get that, unless we want to watch videos or file transfers between ourselves. I'm certain we are being throttled.
 At least once a week the internet will not have an outside connection (we have had many technicians come out to look to no avail (each costing us at least $50, despite them promising we weren't going to be charged for a technician.) So we will simply not have a connection during these times.
 Calling Comcast does nothing except cause problems. Every time we have to call them to fix something, another thing is added onto the bill or broken and we have to get it fixed. It's a cycle of money.
 Too many hoops and restrictions to have a reliable connection, and we have no other viable options.

1649,"Initially, Comcast service was fine in our area. Perhaps not the best, but easily usable. About a month or more into our service, we began experiencing somewhat common latency spikes of up to 1000ms and over. Sometimes to over 2000ms. It would cause us to be unable to browse very minimal, lightweight websites, or even simply communicate with others via messaging services. As of late, this poor service has only gotten worse. We now have regular difficulty loading websites, watching videos, or playing games at any time of the day. I've run traceroutes and ping tests and commonly come up with very high latencies, and speed tests that typically result in sub 1mbps down speeds despite the fact that we pay for 25Mbps down service. In fact, while writing this message, I've been running a speed test in the background and not once has it risen above 0.20 mbps down, and a ping test which shows a ping of over 1200ms which is absolutely unacceptable. I even tried to download a better traceroute utility for this but the internet was so bad that a file only 1.8MB in size took over 20 minutes of me trying to download it before I just gave up. Also, aside from even the speed issues, we been getting complete loss of downstream and upstream channels that has knocked out internet for entire nights. I know this is not any issue with our networking equipment. We're running Comcast's top recommended modem, an Arris CM820A, along with an Intel Atom box running PFSense routing software, and an enterprise-grade Meraki Access Point. It is also worth noting that several diagnostic tests of the hardware show that it is working correctly.

1651,"In several markets (including Central Kentucky, where I live), Comcast has imposed a monthly data
 cap of 300gb. While that may seem a generous amount, it's paltry given the rise of services such as
 Netflix, Hulu, etc. Also, OS updates are becoming larger and larger all the time, and many
 applications are now delivered via the Internet in lieu of physical media. However, the filesizes have
 only continued to grow.
 Some quick math shows that to reach 300gb in a 30 day period, one would only need to use
 approximately 2.8mbps for 8 hours per day (a not uncommon thing for many households or
 businesses). This is far slower than what most Comcast plans are capable of (usually 20-50mbps).
 The issue comes into stark focus when looking at the amount of data used by Netflix. According to
 Netflix, a typical HD stream consumes about 3 gigabytes of data per hour. This means that if one
 were to use Netflix or a similar streaming video service, they would be forced to limit their viewing to
 one hour per day to stay within the 300 gigabyte limit.
 So while Comcast claims they are not throttling streaming video services, they are doing the next best
 thing, and capping data allowances to prevent users from replacing cable TV services with more
 convenient offerings.
 Comcast will claim the usage caps are to ""prevent abuse."" However, 3gb per hour comes to roughly
 7mbps, wich is roughly 1/3 of the available throughput of their 20mbps offering, or 14% of their
 ""Blast!"" offering, which is advertised as ""up to 50mbps"".
 Clearly this is an end-run around Net Neutrality rules, as any service not capable of sustaining 1/3 or
 less of the advertised speed is poorly planned and means they are trying to shift the blame onto
 consumers.
 As technology progresses, bandwidth gets cheaper and cheaper. What's more, while the throughput
 may be limited, the information itself is NOT. If I leave my 1/3 of the way open, I'm using a finite
 resource. If I'm using 1/3 of my advertised Internet speed, the Internet won't ""dry up"" like a reservoir
 will. Data caps are purely a way to extort more money from people who have the temerity to actually
 use what they are being sold.
 I urge you to use all means possible to ensure Comcast halts this anti-competitive, anti-consumer
 practice, and replace it with proper network management that only punishes those who deliberately
 congest the network, rather than ""leave the tap open at a drip."""
1652,"On May 7, 2015, I returned the three pieces of equipment( SN: PKGVLQJWS, SABXJBGJD,
 CCA462AF92F2) to Comcast because I was returning to Fort Bragg, NC on military orders. The
 equipment was returned to the Brown Mills, NJ location. The clerk was unable to close on her end,
 so she issued me a ticket number :028896996. Around 15 May 2015, I called Comcast to receive my
 final bill to only found out that they didn't disconnect my service at all. I explained again that I had left
 the area on military orders will would like for the cable and internet services to be cancelled. I was
 issued another ticket number: 029109151. However, it is now 26 May 2015, another bill has been
 posted, but I haven't resided at the Fort Dix address for more than 3 weeks now and I turned in the
 equipment prior to leaving. I would also like to receive a refund for the days that I had to pay because
 of their failure to disconnect on 7 May 2015. I have attached the receipt showing where I turned the
 equipment on 7 May 2015 and the two ticket numbers I was given in hopes that this issues would
 have been resolved."
1653,"I placed a disc order because we were moving to new loc. Against my better judgement, changed to move order. Install order slated for 1-3 on June 27th 2015. 4pm Comcast calls and states tech running late. 430 tech shows up leaves all equipment and states unable to activate... Goodbye. My wife calls in enraged the service is not working and questioning how a professional would just walk out with the job incomplete. Transferred to 4 different departments hung up on a finally she reaches someone who states they can help. 21 mins later advised sorry the dept which can help you is closed, they are closed tomorrow so have to wait til Monday. This is unacceptable! Why should MY family have to suffer because Comcast has unprofessional, uncaring and incompetent employees? However, this too shall pass. This is a temporary location and rest assured we will NEVER EVER use Comcast again! Good job! I guess eventually our service will be activated and you can again resume billing me your exorbitant rates for your subpar service...oh wait you are probably billing me now for my non working service.
 Update Mon 6/29/2015
 No one has contacted me, service still DOES NOT WORK. Contacted billing as per the previous reps direction...nope can not assist me. Then transferred to customer resolution dept, no idea what he is talking about or what is going on, advises me I need tech support and he would bring on the line with us. He proceeds to transfer me, 15 minutes..no answer. Thanks again Comcast for this fabulous service!
 It seems to me, no one knows why my service is not working and obviously no one cares. I have already made several complaints with the FCC and I will continue to do so until all my service is working.

1654,"Hello respected human,
 I am a resident of public housing in Ramsey new jersey,I want to know that we have no competition in internet,tv and phone service,we have been dealing with cablevision which increases there prices every year and I have no choice. I am not allowed to have a dish by housing authority,
 On top of that I am paying cable $100.00 a month without most TV channells,
 I am forced to watch cable vision ads while paying them.(matterfact i should be paid by cable company to let them advertise to consumers who is paying them. Also this how they advertise to waste there money to charge consumers more, in that sense i should not have to watch Verizon advertisement is well caz they can not provide me service here.
 Since this is the age of target advertisement why both companies are wasting millions of there ad money on me, they advertise low price packages and then cable vision tells me ,I am not there target customer ????
 Another point I want to bring to your notice CELL phone companies give you 30 day money back guarantee but we consumers don,t get the 1st bill in a month also 30 day guarantee was when they were offering contract for 1 year only now minimum contract is for 2 years ,satisfaction guarantee should be for 3 months now.
 I hope I made some valid points and consumers could benefit from it.
 Thank you
 Sincerely,
 Ramsey NJ 07446

1655,"Very shady internet service and I bet 100% is because Comcast is the only provider in our neighborhood; therefore, they get to play with the speed and accessibility of the internet service they provide constantly. Not to mention the shady billings claiming they will send a tech to check out the service and never mention to me that its a paid service, which I think it should not be. Another instance, service tech was scheduled to come out and never showed up, yet we got billed for it. We have moved to our house 3 years ago. The first two years was a constant battle with Comcast to fix our problem with speed and inconsistence in accessibility to internet, we got tired. I guess that is what big Corporations like Comcast hope it happens. Even after our ""last fix"" from Comcast last summer, internet has been slow with constant outages.

 ticket # 358902 was not resolved. I don't understand why FCC closed our complaint just based on a response from Comcast!!!!! we were paiying for a service we didn't receive for a full year. When we filed the complaint, Comcast sent a tech, he said something was wrong with their box outside and crew will come within 24 hrs to fix it, on the next day another Comcast rep called to follow up and he said we had the wrong modem that doesn't support the blast internet service!!!!!!! For a full year just now Comcast told us they gave us the wrong equipment! Until today, July 16th, 2015 we have not received resolution or compensations for Comcast screw up and FCC just closed the case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for no help!"

1657,"We are long-standing customers of Comcast (only because we have no other internet options in our area ; we dropped their tv service years ago because of TERRIBLE customer service). We recently moved to a new address (a week ago) and need to transfer our internet service. It took a week of making phone calls to successfully set up the transfer. We were told the ideal route to take was to buy the self-install kit, so we did. I was given an address to go to to pick up the kit, and when I drove there I found that the location they gave me was incorrect. I found a locked building with remnants of a recent move. I could not find an updated address on their website and there is no way to speak to a human for this information without sitting through a horrendous voice menu, entering all of my account information first, in order to get a correct address. I eventually found the building and picked up a kit. I also returned a modem I had been renting from them because they never informed me that the rental fee had gone from $3 a month to $10 a month and I had unknowingly been paying that for at least a year.
 The next morning my husband followed the directions on the self install kit, but the directions did not work and they wouldn't even recognize our account on the website. I then called in to do the installation over the phone, and after giving all of the same information that we had already provided online to perform the set up, I was told to hold for seven minutes so that they could complete the set up. After a seven minute hold, the man returned to the line to tell me they were having technical difficulties and that I had to call back in an hour. Considering that this call alone had taken approximately 45 minutes, I asked if they could call me back instead. They said that they do not have the ability to call their customers. Later that evening we tried the self install online again and it still didn't work. This is the second day we paid for service that wasn't working.
 The next day I called in again to attempt installation and was unsuccessful, this time being told that no one ever came out to turn the outside line on, which is routinely done by them before a customer does a self-install. I was told that this would be done the next day between 12 and 5pm, and that I didn't have to be home. I asked them to have the technician call me to confirm that they were there and notify me if that was indeed the problem. I was assured by a ""supervisor"" that I would receive that call. This call lasted another 45 minutes with hold times.
 The next day I awaited that call but never received it. I went home at about 5PM assuming it would be fixed but it was still not working. I called again and after 30 minutes of hold time was referred to another ""supervisor"". This man told me that we needed a technician to come to our house to install our internet and assured me that someone would come out the next day. I told him no one would be home until 4PM and he assured me that someone would be there after 4, as he was noting our schedule needs in the request. This phone call took another 45 minutes. My husband adjusted his work schedule to be there by 4PM the next day.
 At 2PM the next day, I received a voicemail that a technician was at my house and left and that I needed to call 1800COMCAST to reschedule my appointment (please recall the appointment was for after 4pm). I called them, had to go through the same tedious voice menu only to be directed to an outsourced agent who spoke such broken English that I could hardly communicate with them. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and she repeatedly told me no supervisors were available. She said our only option was to reschedule again for another day. I told her it was unacceptable and that I needed to speak with someone else so she placed me on hold. I held for 47 minutes. No one returned. I then hung up and called back and went through the same voice menu. Another representative answered and I had essentially the exact same conversation with her. She also placed me on hold when I asked for a supervisor. I held for 20 more minutes. She never came back. At this point I was exhasperated so my mother in law called back. She was told that we could reschedule for Friday evening (2 days away) and was assured that a supervisor named Josh would call me. Josh called me moments later and told me that he would credit my bill $40 and assured me that we would not be charged for any service that was done when the technician arrived. I was told by every person I had spoken to up to this point that if I wanted credit on my bill for the days missed I would have to call back after resolution to speak to billing. Josh also told me that someone would call me Friday evening after installation to ensure everything was taken care of.
 The next day, Thursday, my husband had an unexpected day off of work so we called to see if our installation could be moved to that day instead of waiting an extra day. They said they had an appointment for 12-5 so we scheduled that. We were told someone would be there between 12 & 5PM. At approximately 4PM I received a call from a woman from Comcast stating that the technician would no longer be able to make the appointment because he was busy and that no one was available because the technicians are finished at 4:30 PM. I demanded to speak to a supervisor. She placed me on hold for 5 minutes and then disconnected me. No one ever called me back. My mother in law then called in, spent over an hour on the phone trying to reach a supervisor. She was told no one could come to our house until Saturday at 8-10AM. This would now be a week without service and over 6 hours of phone time with them. She stated that she wanted to file a complaint. I then received a call from someone from Comcast stating that she had my mother in law on the phone (as if a conference call was taking place). This woman told me that she needed my address and account information. I gave her that information and she said she needed to place me on hold. She hung up on me. She then told my mother in law that I agreed that a $20 credit would resolve the situation (which I did not, and it was never even mentioned to me). My mother in law told her she didn't believe her and said she needed to talk to me first. The woman said she would call her back at 6PM. She never did. I've asked multiple times if I could have a number to speak with someone directly and each time I've been told that there are no direct lines for comcast. We just don't know what to do anymore. No one will resolve it, and we can't keep adjusting our schedules for this service that we pay for but are NOT receiving. I've tried reaching out on Twitter and NUMEROUS, LENGTHY phone calls, and no one is willing to help.
 Comcast, in the years we've been their customers, has repeatedly neglected to hold up their agreement for the services we continue to pay for and they make it impossible for their customers to communicate with them in order to resolve it. The amount of time, money, and anguish I've spent dealing with them is simply unacceptable! I can't keep spending an hour a day trying to obtain internet.

1658,"Hello!
 My complaint is about how Comcast is blocking paying customers with access to HBO Go on Playstation platforms.
 Is it legal for a company to deny a service to paying customers when it could be detrimental to a different service the company also has interests in?
 HBO Go is a video streaming service made available through multiple platforms. One of these are the playstation systems, in which an HBO Go app is available. The only things that are technically needed are: playstation system, hbo subscription through your cable provided, hbo go app, internet connection.
 I currently own all of the above, a PS3, the free HBO Go app, and internet & hbo subscription through Comcast XFinity. However, I am not allowed to use the app on Playstation 3 because Comcast has not committed to an agreement with HBO. Many other service providers allow their customers to use this app and Comcast allows HBO access through many other platforms.
 So its not a matter of technical feasibility or what services I am paying for.
 I would like to complain about Comcast's delay in providing paying customers availability to HBO content through Playstation systems.
 It almost feels like they are keeping my internet access hostage because its not convenient for them that customers watch shows on something other than a TV.
 I have contacted them multiple times and while they have been very apologetic about it, they have no committed date for this support.
 Thank you!

1659,"Comcast is one of the worst service providers I have ever used. I pay for 150Mbit speeds, but receive no more than 70Mbit peak no matter what time of day, under BEST case conditions. The majority of the time speeds are under 40Mbit and it is not uncommon to see speeds plummet to a sub-100KB/sec speed around 8pm PT when usage is at it's peak.
 Comcast is ruining the most wonderful technological advancement our species has ever developed and I hate them for it. Seriously, I hate Comcast and if I had ANY other option for broadband internet I would switch immediately, even if the service was for the same speeds and twice the money I currently pay Comcast; just so I would no longer have to participate in funding their assault on innovation.

1660,"I am renting a modem from Comast and after two years my connection started to get REALLY bad, so I called Comcast to complain about it. They sent a guy over to see what was going on, who confirmed that the one I had was really old and he updated it to a new one, which fixed the problem, BUT, Comcast charged me $70 to have him come out!!!! I am a very low income, single, disabled mother, that $70 caused me GREAT financial hardship.Seems convenient for them to make products (the modem) which will go bad after a couple of years so that the customer HAS to get a new one and they can CHARGE for it!! It wasn't MY fault the modem stopped working, so I should NOT be charged to fix it. I HATE COMCAST!!!! I would switch companies but there are no other ISPs in my area.

In doing so, Comcast also double charged me of roughly 10 days worth of service fee. I have called Comcast numerous times over the past month but the issue still has not been resolved.
 Besides the above described unauthorized charges of undisclosed fees, Comcast's so called ""customer service"" was a joke and seemed insulting at times. I have been put on long wait, been disconnected when I asked questions they did not want to answer, or been transferred among various department and asked to repeat my account information again and again without ever resolve any if the problems.

1668,"Hello FCC- 
  
 I've been having issues with Comcast for years. As much as I'd like to cancel my service, there are no other viable options in my area (especially for high speed internet, which I need for work). Most recently I was charged $50 for equipment that I had already returned. In the past, I've endured gigantic price increases without my knowledge, extremely poor customer service quality, and 
 cable/internet issues. Today I was supposed to have a tech come out due to internet inconsistency, but he never showed up. 
 I don't know what can be done, as Comcast has no competition when it comes to high speed internet (and I think they know this). It would be nice if they were held accountable for their actions, as they've negatively affected so many Americans (per everyone I talk to and every message board I read, as well as my personal experiences). I know I can't do anything personally against Comcast. I'm just hoping someone reads this, along with the thousands of other complaints I'm sure you receive, and tries to make a change. 
 Thank you for your time.

1670,"I have only 1 company provider in my area. That leaves me locked into their rates. I call, am given a rate, my bill comes and it's twice what I was quoted. I call again and even though I can give them who I spoke with and the rate they say they can't find it and now my rate is much higher. This has happened to friends of mine so I know it's a practice on a part of the company. If I had another option for service I don't think they would be so bold and deceptive. Just across the street there is another company but I can't get it. Why? I am a senior on limited income. I moved here to care for my father, who is on limited income, and needs 24 hour supervision. No rates are published it's just whatever is given over the phone and I have to accept it if I want service. I started at a rate in 50 + dollar range and am know up into the 70's.

1671,"After calling into the 1-800 number to verify that I could pick up a self install kit in my local office, which I was told from them would be free of charge, going around the shiping and handling fees that it would cost if I ordered it, I was surprised to have the representative in office try and charge me $20, glazing over that fact while giving a quick run down of first-time-fees, telling me that there was no way someone on the phone told me the charges were negated by coming in. It wasn't until after getting a manager and refusing to pay/follow through with setting up service were they able to waive what they called ""wire fees"" (although in ordering the S & H fees are cheaper?).
 Upon getting home, I found that I was not able to do self install despite my building being wired for service. Over the next 4 days I have called and spoken with Comcast 5 times, the first 4 times someone promising to find me the next available appointment, recognizing the issues I had been having, but needing to call back because the wait time to check appointments were too long for them to ask me to stay on the line, every time I was told that they ""would be handling this issue personally"" and calling back before they ended their shift, not one of these four call backs were made. After calling tonight, I asked to speak to a supervisor who told me that I was lying when I said those people never called back, that they always make appointments on the phone and wouldn't have needed to call back, yet could not explain to me why I had an appointment scheduled for a time when I would be back at work, following time off that I had around my recent move. When I said that I had no desire to continue to pay for such expensive (and clearly deceptive) services from them, especially given all of the poor customer service I had gotten before I have even had service, she again assured me that there was nothing they did wrong, ignoring my issues entirely, and again repeating that they would have made appointments swiftly, while I was on the phone. Her only response in regards to me canceling my service (before it has begun) was ""That's fine then, you can take your equipment back tomorrow, should I cancel this appointment?""
 Very dissapointed at how deceptive they are as far as fees are concerned, especially after I asked specifically about different fees before going to the office. Not only that but to have had so many negative customer service interactions before I can set up service to begin with is a huge turn off, but unfortunatly as a student in the area I am in, my hands are tied with no other comprable competitor options where I am. Very dissapointed at how my situation is being handled as well as how much they dominate service in our area.

1672,"My company, MAXX Potential, along with several others, work in the Corrugated Box building in Richmond, VA. The only non-DSL Internet provider in the area is Comcast. Most the building shares a common connection. We shared that connection up until several months ago, when we moved into the downstairs space and installed a dedicated connection. I both cases the connectivity has been abysmal. On pretty much daily basis, we have significant down time, slow speeds and dropped connections. When we moved into the new space, we immediately had issues. Comcast sent a technician that recommended going back to an older model cable modem. This did nothing to improve the situation. I've probably called 10 times in the last few month. I could have called more, but I have a business to run. Last week I finally got Comcast to admit there was a network problem on their end in our area. However, they could not provide use a timeline for resolution or even a promise of status updates. Several of the companies in the building are small technology companies that need reliable Internet to service customers and grow. They are all experiencing the same issues. The time that is lost due to lack of Internet and also dealing with customer service could be used for economic growth in an upcoming coming area of Richmond. I will say Comcast customer support has been very courteous, but in the end, not very helpful. Comcast has offered us an upgrade to a dedicated fiber connection. However, that would be 5x times the cost. I do not want make that investment when they cannot deliver the current service at promised levels. All we want is the service we paid for. We are not looking for discounts or upgrades. Any help would be much appreciated.

1674,"To Whom It May Concern,
 I have noticed constant speed latency on my home xfinity wifi. I should be getting standard speeds of up to 25mbps download. It is impossible that I have any device hardlined to the router and cannot stream a youtube video without delays. I have had technicians come to ""resolve"" the problem but the internet especially wifi seems to slow down to a crawl about 50% of the day.
 Using comcast's funded speed test Ookla (which Comcast technicians test with) always gives perfect 25-30mbps readings. But when I use a html based speed test vs. proprietary Flash driven speed tests I get results as low as 5-10mbps.
 I am tired of waiting on hold and having multiple technicians come out to my home where I need the internet to transfer business documents for my job. I have heard of FCC resolutions and quick turn arounds by providers. I am paying too much money per month $81.76 ($76.95 before fees and extras) to have this kind of service.

1676,"I have a 24 month contract with a 24 month promotion period on Comcast. My contract was initially filled by a direct sales representative, so I have a paper hand written contract form and includes internet, cable tv, landline telephone, and equipment for $89.99/month not including taxes.
 My contract began in September of 2013. Shortly after I began receiving my service, the price of my package went up significantly. I called Comcast several times in attempt to resolve the error. When it became apparent they were unable to resolve it over the phone they directed me to go to the Comcast office directly and resolve it there. After an hour+ wait at the office they were finally able to correct my account billing.
 In September of 2014 my package price went up again. I again called Comcast to attempt to resolve the issue. The representatives refused to believe I have a 24 month promotion and again directed me to go into their office to resolve the issue. After additional time off work to wait at the office for support in person, they were able to (mostly) correct my billing error. I say ""mostly"" because the final resolution was a few pennies higher than my stated contract price and was not enough of a price difference to warrant the many hours it takes to resolve a billing dispute with Comcast.
 This month I went to the Comcast office to return a DVR that was sitting unused in my house. After returning the equipment, I received an email saying that my bill had increased to $250/month. I again called Comcast in attempt to resolve the error. According to the representatives I've spoken with over the phone , I am no longer under a contract with Comcast so my ""promotions"" have all expired. They again directed me to go into the physical Comcast office and resolve the error in person.
 I am filing this complaint because I feel that repeatedly taking time away from work to resolve an error from Comcast is unjust and unreasonable. It seems that Comcast has done everything in their power to not honor my service contact.

1677,"i moved to richmond virgnia in January of 2014.
 Upon moving into my apartment, i was already registered with Verizon high-speed internet.
 When i discovered that the fastest speed they were able to provide me was 7.1mbps, i decided to seek another provider that could offer me more for a similar price.
 I found that Comcast was the only other provider for my building.
 When i signed up with Comcast they offered me 25mbps at $29.99 for the first year, where it would then increase to $44.99.
 I accepted this offer and all was well.
 This past June, when i moved to a new home in the same city, i sought to transfer my existing account to the new address.
 While on the phone with my customer service agent, they offered me an additional promotion where for just $5 i would have an increased internet speed of 50mbps, local television, and an active HBO GO account.
 I accepted the offer because i truly wanted faster internet, i wasn’t concerned at all about the television bonus.
 I was also promised a 30-day satisfaction wherein they would revert my bill if i was unsatisfied — no questions asked.
 When i inquired about the necessary cable equipment, i was informed that my new pricing structure would not come into effect until i obtained and activated the new cable box.
 After obtaining the cable box, activating, and testing my newly increased internet speeds, i learned that they had not actually increased at all.
 I was still receiving the same speed of 25mbps.
 I called Comcast to inquire, and they insisted that they had never promised me a faster internet speed than the one i currently had.
 According to Comcast, they do not offer a 50mbps speed, only a 105mbps.
 Outraged, i insisted that they cancel the current plan and revert me back, as promised.
 The agent pleaded that i give him an extra business day to further research a different offer wherein i could obtain faster internet speeds without increasing my bill tremendously.
 He also continued to remind me of my still existing 30-day guarantee.
 Because he was a personable agent, unlike most i’d spoken to previously, i accepted his challenge and gave him a business day to contact me with a new, possible solution.
 Tomorrow came, and the agent did not call.
 He never called.
 I waited a week, in case he might try to reach me with a solution but the phone never rang.
 Finally, i contacted Comcast to address the issue and cancel the existing offer and revert to my previous bill.
 They said that they could not do that.
 I believe very specifically they stated that, “the current promotions available to us do not allow us to revert your bill to its original status”.
 I asked to speak to a manager where i received an additional agent citing the very same problem.
 They insisted that the only thing they could do, was revert my account back to the previous plan, but i would then be required to pay the base price of $64.99.
 Clearly, that is more than i was paying before and is not at all the definition of a 30-day risk-free satisfaction guarantee.
 I was very vocal about my dissatisfaction with their offer and their inability to honor a system they put in place to create a sense of security to its customers when being offered new packages over the phone.
 I did not seek out these offers, they were presented to me by an effort on the part of Comcast.
 When i expressed a desire to complain and seek a higher authority to rectify this issue, the agent was very quick to drop the price of said package from $64.99 to $56.99 based on a “one-time offer”.
 While this was still not the price i desired, i found it very odd how easy it was for this agent to simply lower the price of a package i had just previously been told was non-negotiable.
 Dissatisfied, i requested to speak to a higher representative where i could voice a formal complaint about the issue.
 It was becoming clear to me that i was stuck paying this fixed price of $49.99 for services i never wanted or else pay an additional $15 to have them removed.
 The agent was very hesitant to forward me to a higher representative and insisted that she could solve the problem herself.
 She copied down my phone number and informed me that she would call me back momentarily when she had a solution.
 After perhaps 20-minutes or so, i received a phone call from the representative stating that she was able to revert my bill back to its previous state and that my payments now and in the future would remain at the $44.99 price point.
 Through this experience, it is clear to me that Comcast spends much of their time bullying customers into television packages under false pretense and promise of higher quality products the consumer may already have.
 This was not the first, or even the tenth time i had been contacted by Comcast seeking that i upgrade my account to a television or telephone package.
 Then they offer a 30-day satisfaction, but they’re quick to avoid mentioning that the guarantee has nothing to do with the price you’re currently paying for said services. It only guarantees that they will have the ability to up-charge you to return to a service package you once had.
 After this experience, i will be petitioning Verizon to offer FIOS high-speed in my area in an effort to avoid doing further business with Comcast, but currently i have no other available options.
 Thank you for your time.

 Hi
 On June 26, 2015 i was contacted by someone who addressed themselves as a Comcast employee in reference to my FCC complaint.
 They apologized for my troubles and as a gesture of good will, they promised to upgrade my Comcast account from ""performance"" internet at 25mbps to ""blast"" internet at 105mbps for the next two years at a promotional price of $44.99 (the same price i am currently paying).
 However, i am currently on the phone with comcast still trying to figure out why my internet speeds have not increased.
 The customer service agent on the phone with me right now says that my account still has the ""performance"" internet package and that there are no notes indicating that my internet package was ever changed, adjusted, or even noted.
 Once again, i was sold false hope."
1678,"I am having issues with my internet through Comcast. I am paying for 105mbps wireless internet and I am only getting 20mbps. I have contacted comcast on multiple occasions about this issue, but I have not gotten any resolution. The most recent time was on 6/24/15 I spent 2 hours speaking with representatives from different departments with one sending me to a comcast location. I requested to speak with someone about getting adjustments on my account because of not getting the services that I am paying for. The representatives from customer loyalty stated because there are no notes on the account that I cannot get any credits. I have been paying for service since October and I feel that I should get back if not all then half of my money that I paid. This is an ongoing issue with Comcast.

1679,"When I signed up for Comcast I received my ad through email which stated that their service for
 internet was free. Now out of nowhere it 300GB. How come I wasn't informed of this that there was
 such drastic changes? Or was their false ad just a lure to snag people into their crappy service. I'm so
 unhappy and when I told them that was going to contact the FCC and BBB they disconnected me
 from the conversation. If I wanted to get ripped off for my internet service and charged ridiculous
 amounts for internet the should be unlimited I would have stuck with at&t. Guess I will be shutting off
 my service soon and trying to find a service that will provide unlimited at a decent price, wont false
 advertise, and is unlimited.

 difficult to call you back knowing that I would had to call over 15 different numbers. and the fact that a

1681,"As I am sure you are aware, Comcast has started a Data Cap program in several test markets. They are restricting my account to no more than 250GB per calendar month, if I exceed that I have to pay $10.00 per 50GB.
 I live with my wife and two children and we use iPhones, iPads, and watch Netflix. Nothing out of the ordinary in 2015. We have already BLOWN through our data usage this month. We have used double what they say we should have used. That is absolutely ridiculous.
 The worst part is they are the only telecon company that services my house. So I have no choice but to pay whatever they want. It feels inherently wrong that they are able to do this to a normal consumer. Please do something and bring some kind of regulation to the arbitrary caps, that frankly feel like a money grab.

As of the most recent speed test I had 2.21 mb down and 0.91 mb up. This is on a good day. My speed has been getting slower and slower over the years I've been with Comcast while my bill simply creeps higher and higher whenever they feel it necessary. That being said, I don't mind paying the current price if I simply got halfway decent internet service out of it.

They were supposed credit me $130 but they never did (for the 3 weeks from 9/15-mid October). I called back with a confirmation provided by a representative but was told that that was not an actual confirmation number. Currently, they have my internet shut off because of this back balance which was supposed to be credited. When I call back the dates they refer to are not the same as previous conversations.

1690,"Consumer is still having issues with Comcast stemming from her original complaint 14-C00632547. Comcast lied in the carrier response, saying they resolved the issue, but that is not true. Consumer continues to experience issues with her landline service. The caller ID service does not work the majority of the time and the voicemail service malfunctions greatly. The voicemail will pop up during calls, interrupting them and will not shut off. After completing calls she also has to wait at least two minutes before she is able to place another call. Inbound calls sometimes will not complete as well. Her internet service is also intermittent. A technician was most recently out on 06/10/2015 and fixed the service but it will probably go out again soon. Comcast is charging her full price when she does not receive proper working service. Comcast says they will adjust the billing once the matter is resolved, but this problem has been going on for over six months and they still have yet to fix it. As a resolution, she would like Comcast to resolve the service issues and refund her for the time she had to pay full price for intermittent services. ***CTR359-phone***

1691,"On April 24, 2015, we switched to Comcast for XFINITY Bundled Services. We immediately began
 having problems with our internet connection, frequently having to reset our router. On Saturday,
 April 26, we spoke to a service technician who did some troubleshooting over the phone. The
 problem was not resolved. I called Comcast to explain the problem, and was met with very poor
 customer service over the phone. I was transferred to different people each time I called, and was
 told conflicting things. Our router continued to need resetting. We set up another appt. for a service
 technician to come over. A technician made a visit on May 2. Almost immediately after he left, we
 had the same problem with our router. We called again and set up another appt. for May 3. A
 technician never showed up on May 3. I made additional calls to Comcast and got nowhere. The
 next appt that was available was not until the following Saturday. I asked to speak to a supervisor
 and was told that a supervisor was not in. I was assured that a supervisor would call me back when
 he or she arrived at work, but I never got a phone call. I spent hours on the phone, was treated
 rudely, and the problem continued. On May 9, another technician came over. Although our problem
 is better, we received a computer message today that we are having a wiring problem. Because our
 WiFi has been unavailable so frequently, we have incurred data overage charges on our Verizon bill.
 We are extremely disappointed with the poor, unacceptable service that Comcast has provided.

1694,"My husband called Comcast on May 6, 2015 to complain about the internet being down. We only
 have internet service at the time he called. He was told that there was an outage in the area but at the
 same time, the same rep offered him faster internet service for $2 less per month than what we
 currently pay. He agreed. He was never told that he was signing up for Ca ble TV service. When I
 logged in to our account, it showed that we just ordered Xfinity TV which was not disclosed to him at
 the time he spoke to the the rep. I called on May 7 to request the order to be cancelled and to revert
 everything back to the way it was and the rep said it was done and she was glad I called right away
 because the equipment has not shipped. I requested a confirmation email of the cancellation.
 Received nothing, my account showed that they shipped the equipment and the Xfinity TV was never
 cancelled. As if I never called called them. These people are deceptive and duped my husband to a
 service package he never agreed to. I don't know how to cancel this service because their
 cancellation department never processed my request even though I was told they did. Please help."
1695,"My name is . I called Comcast at the end of January 2015 to inquire on their prices for internet service. The representative i spoke to ordered the services without us agreeing to it. My husband has never spoken to Comcast; I've been the one who has been dealing with this issue from the beginning. We were unaware that we had internet service until we received the modem and an invoice with a past due balance. I have called multiple times trying to sort out the issue. We continued to receive invoices with new monthly charges. Despite the multiple times I spoke to Comcast the account was sent to collections for nonpayment. I called again around May 11, 2015 and was told to wait at least 10 days for the issue to be resolved. I received a voicemail on May 12 letting me know that I needed to file a police report for fraud. I called Comcast and left a message for the person who had contacted me asking her to call me back because I did not believe that we had to file a police report since it was their mistake and the services were ordered in error by them. I called again on May 18th because I had not yet received a call back. I was on hold for almost an hour waiting to speak to a supervisor. I was then told I would get a call back from the supervisor that same day between 1:30 to 2:30, but I never did. I called Comcast again on May 23rd asking to speak to a supervisor. The representative who answered my call advised me that it had to wait the 10 days for the issue to be resolved and that I should be getting a call back from the department handling it. He also said that I should be getting a call back on Tue. May 26 since May 25th was a holiday. I am still waiting for a call back from Comcast and I am still getting calls from the collections agency.

Other suppliers list the but the are all out of stock and do not know when if ever they will . My modem model TC 8305C . Was told to exchange it at the Rockford, IL store. The battery was still working as the lights were on. I was going to pull the battery but was told by the agent that the new modem would have a new battery. When I got it home I found there was no battery. I went back the next day and asked for my old battery or a new one and was told they could not do that . I was told that these batteries were sold on the internet for under $20. Found out that was not true either. I am 77 years old and my phones need this battery if the cable goes out which it does quite often. No one company should have that much power to dictate what other people can sell and for what price I thought monopoly was illegal.

 Threaten to cut off my service?? I want my Internet back Up Its what I'm Paying For, I had My Friend
 Head Of Tech Of "" HCA hospitals"" to help me look at my equipment...."
1699,"I signed up for TV and internet (actually do not want TV but the service is cheaper in a bundle) with Comcast. I said on the sign up that I would provide my own modem and I purchased on from their approved list. I do know how to ""Hook Up"" the equipment but decided to pay for installation in case there were connection issues...it has be several years since any service of this type was in my house. The installer came 6/9..his paper work said Comcast would be providing the modem but the one I had was fine with him so he went about his job. He was unable to install because the outside wires from the Big Comcast box did not work and new wires has to be installed. He told me his was ordering this and gave me his cell# so I could call him to finish the installation when the new wires were in...he guessed this would be done by the 12th. He said I did not need to be home since this was all outside. I came home the 10th to find a tag from Comcast on my door ""Sorry We Missed You""
 we came to retrieve equipment (what equipment?) call the agent below (no agent listed) to set up another appointment. I called a phone number on the hang tag and went thru the menu to get a representative who seemed not to understand the issue. I called the number again and went thur the menu..this rep seemed to get it and expedited the line installation for the 11th. I came home the 11th and it had not been done. I phoned again and 3 times in a row, after going thur the menu to get a rep ..I was disconnected while describing the issue. I had agreed to complete a survey about my call and each time gave an unsatisfactory rating. I got a VM from Comcast installation about uncompleted installation and called only to be told they did the inside installation not the outside wiring ..but they did transfer me. This time I was told it would be rushed and done on the 12th. I was assured I could call on the 15th to reschedule the inside installation It was not done. I got a message from a Donna Oliver at Comcast asking that I call her..I called 5 times and dutifully left my name and phone number . I called the 15th and after the menu and questions about ""mis Utility"" , permits and such I was assured it would be done on the 16th. It was not done. I called the 16th and was told I would be done on the 17th. In the meantime I am still leaving my name and number (as requested) on Donna Oliver's VM). Donna Oliver phoned..said it was my fault that my gate was locked..my gate was not even closed..stated she had called me last week and had no knowledge of the messages I was leaving daily. Ms Oliver said she would handle it and that it would done the 17th. It was not done. The Main Comcast box is about 30 feet from my house. The Comcast truck is frequently seen in my neighborhood.

However, this promotion was for HBO and another channel. Now they are charging me for HBO, this channel, and there are new fees that were not previously present on the bill. This seems like predatory billing to me. They have also mysteriously increased the bill without cause by $10 throughout our contract.

I called again and was told i will have my email in a day or two, again NOTHING!! i called yet again asking politely to get my email back running, I was told by someone that they promise my email will be returned and they will personally call me with temporary password, DID NOT HAPPEN!! I have dealt with rude, horribly inpolite people for over THREE WEEKS now this is beyond upsetting and ridiculous, i am ready to cancel every service me and my family have with Comcast after the helpfulness of your customer service which is supposed to be excellent and is HORRIBLE . I still have NO EMAIL and had to create a new one . I am terribly disjointed and fed up especially that i pay my very high bill on time every month and the service i receive is horrible . I need email back ASAP and i cannot find one person that is HELPFUL. Instead i;m being transferred around departments, treated poorly and lied to ! Please fix this issue ASAP !

 Xfinity/Comcast has inform me that their company can change the contract/agreement with customers at any given time. Including prices/services/over charging. ..... that this is in their *terms and conditions* Why and how can a company do that???? this issue is not resolved and this company is overcharging just in Georgia. Not anywhere else do they have a {data cap}. why is that???? Comcast is telling me that it is ok for them to steal from me.

1707,"I have tried to contact Comcast regarding an issue about ""overage charges"" for data on my internet plan and how I am not getting notifications about being close to my data cap. When I contacted them through the online help the person I was speaking to insisted that I was getting the notifications on my phone, in email and on my billing statements. When I asked for proof on this matter I was given nothing. I even explained to them that when I tried to click on ""Manage Notifications"" to see my setting for being notified when the cap was approaching, I get a pop up that say ""Your Request cannot be processed, please try again later."" This issue still happens to this day. After a good long while of going back and forth about this issue I was immediately ""transferred"" to tech support. Where I had to explain my issue yet again. This time the person on the chat randomly disconnected and that was it. So I sent off an email to Comcast explaining what had happened but no one contacted me at all. No one at Comcast will recognize that there is an issue with the notifications even though I have explained it to them and even told them I have screen caps of the problem.

 1. I still am unable to ""manage notifications"" in my user preferences.
 2. 4. A ""Senior Customer Security Assurance technician"" did contact me on April 15th and was absolutely no help whatsoever. All he did was explain to me how the data caps work, how it's my fault the email was incorrect, said I WAS getting phone calls and emails and he suppose to call me back with proof of these calls and email, but never did.
 3. Comcast made an error in what email address to use for these notifications. Instead of using my default email that I used to sign up with, Comcast used the @comcast.net email account that Comcast set up and that I never use.
 4. The Comcast ""My Services & Equipment"" page that is suppose to allow me to check my usage is not allowing me to do so and instead is just constantly displaying ""Loading."" (https://youtu.be/VUxHaJqyaHU)
 5. I would like my overage charges refunded and will continue the complaint until Comcast does so."

1710,"I just recently started my Comcast service, I have had them for a little bit more than a month. I
 ordered my service and a welcome kit arrived in the mail. However, due to a Comcast mistake, my
 internet modem's serial number did not match to the one for my account. Because of that, I could not
 get connected to the internet. I called their 1800 number and the rep told me to mail that modem
 back and they would over night me a new one. This was on a Friday, so it should have arrived on the
 following Tuesday at the latest. I mailed back their modem that day. When Wednesday came, still no
 modem. So I called their 1800 number again and asked for a tracking number so I could see where
 the modem was. The rep gave me that number, however, this was for the original welcome kit, not
 the new modem that I needed. So I called back again, this next rep was useless and could not help
 me. She did not understand my issue at all. I was finally transferred to a supervisor, but she did not
 listen to was I was saying! Her ""solution"" to my problem had nothing to do with resolving my issue!
 After I told her that would not work, she actually decided to listen to me. She told me that she would
 over night another modem, because nothing had been shipped as of yet. And she would be waving
 the shipping fees. This package should have arrived within 2 business days. And again I did not
 arrive. o that Friday, I called their 1800 number again. This time the rep gave me a new tracking
 number and I asked him to track it while I was on the phone, so he could tell me where it is. He told
 me that it would be delivered that day. Mind you this was at 5 pm and I was a bit skeptical. But he
 said UPS delivers until 7 pm so it will be there. I tracked the number myself and it was not set for
 delivery, but instead, only a shipping sheet had been created. UPS had not even picked up the
 package from Comcast yet, and their rep told me it would be at my house that night! I called again
 and the rep said that I would be sent out. 3 days later, it finally arrived and I could set up my internet.
 I called their 1800 number again to set everything up and verify that my account would reflect when
 my service actually started. They had already started billing me before I even had the modem. The
 rep told me that this would be correct and the billing period would change to the day I received and
 set up my service. I was fed up at this point and filled a formal complaint against every previous reps
 that I dealt with. I was told a manager would contact me within 72 hours. This was almost a month
 ago now and I still have not been contacted. I thought everything was all set. I went to there website
 and paid my first bill for $40.23. This is what their webpage told me was due and I paid it. I figured I
 was paid in full for that month. When I got the next bill, it was for $179.49. This is more than triple
 what my bill should have been (around $55). They charged me 4 $29.99 ""SIK Shipping Fees"", I
 guess one for every phone rep I spoke to. They also charged me an extra $20.00 that I apparently
 owed from last month. Even though I paid my bill in full on their website. So I called their 1800 again.
 The rep said that I should not have been charged the shipping fee and their system still have my
 service starting on the date I originally received my welcome kit with the incorrect modem. Which of
 course is not when I started my service with them. He told me this was more that he could refund
 and that he was ""escalating"" my account to a supervisor who would refund the 4 shipping charges
 and the amount I ""owed"" from last month. He told me this this would take 24-48 hours. Well another
 72 hours later, no correction. So I called them again and was told the exact same thing. This would
 be escalated and corrected within 48 hours. 72 hours later still no correction. I contacted Comcast
 again and had to argue with the rep about the amount I should have removed from my bill. After quite
 a bit of back and forth, she agreed to refund all of the shipping fees but not the amount I ""owed"" from
 last month. Even though the start date for my service was incorrect. Well another 48 hours later and
 still no correction to my bill."
1711,"We lose internet connectivity on a daily basis. Sometimes these outages are short and other times they last for an hour or more. When I check the status of the connection on my phone Comcast says we have full signal strength. When I call Comcast they are generally unable to resolve the issue or do resolve it after several attempts and much of my time. All this for the internet to go out again the next day or later that same day.

1712,"Our internet was cut about 10 days ago due to a faulty wire outside the house. We called Comcast, and they scheduled a technician to come out a few days later, on Saturday. When the technician came, he did not know how to solve the problem and said he would tell a supervisor to contact us Monday with a solution. No one called. When we called Comcast to follow up on Monday, they told us the technician from Saturday had simply closed our case. We scheduled another technician for Wednesday fom 4-6 pm (the earliest date Comcast could spare us a technician.) This time, I asked for a supervisor or specialist to come out. On Wednesday, I received a call from the scheduled technician at 3:30 pm. I was not by the phone, because I was at work and going to monitor my phone starting at 4 pm. As soon as I saw the missed call, at 4:15 pm, I called the techinican back. No answer. Over the course of the next hour, I called the technician back 5 times - no answer. When I called Comcast, they said the technician had simply closed the case. I tried to re-schedule for that day, but they could not call him back, so they scheduled a 3rd technician for Thursday (today) from 4-6 pm. We specifically requested the technician call a different number before he arrived (my roommate's cell number), as I would be at work. At 4:10, I received one missed call from Comcast. My roommate received NO calls (even though we requested they call her number.) The technician did not come to the apartment at all. When I called Comcast at 5 pm, they said the technician had closed the case. Comcast said they could no reschedule us until Saturday. I canceled my account with Comcast. We haven't had internet for 10 days now.

1715,"Comcast advertises a wifi with blast with the use of their modems to be 60MBPS upload and 12 MBPS download speeds. I go to school online and I am paying for the highest internet speed with blast. My interent speed when tested is 5-12MBPS upload and 6-12MBPS download varying only slightly but nowhere near the advertised speeds with Comcasts ""Blast"". Now when using Comcast speed test it says 50 upload and 12 download seems like there test is set up as a rouse and yet every other test shows 5 and 6 so that to me verifies the service is not what I paid for. They said to me I have to get a different wireless router they cannot supply one. Why am I paying for this internet service they cannot provide. I am having issues with my online classes and the internet is always going in and out. It seems that they advertise these speeds but cannot provide them. I am very upset with the services they attempt to provide and cannot get any answers or help from them. This seems to be a huge issue when searching the internet that the advertised speeds are not provided but they just charge for the service without delivery of the product. Now if I pay for the services why can they not supply me with the correct equipment to host these advertised internet speeds? They should not advertise these speeds if they cannot provide with their own equipment, when paying for services such as this it is not my responsibility as the customer to go get new equipment and hook it all up so that the supposed advertised speeds can work. This is by definition false advertisement I have added the internet speed tests screenshots from both comcast and a well used site other than comcast noting the differences in what each speed test displays.

 Thank you for telling me what I should be ok with. Thank you for being a pain in the butt since day
 one. Thank you for making me understand that you do not care that I spent the first 4 months of
 internet with a 2MB speed that was verified by YOUR people. Thank you for educating me on the
 fact that it is ok to send me 17 minutes away from my house repeatedly to get a new modem. Thank
 you for making me wait on you while you repeatedly visited me to try to fix my internet and cable.
 Thanks for telling me that I did not complain enough to show that this was a “real” problem and
 should be compensated for.
 I understand that your cable is faster, but to me it has not been. Any vendor would be the same
 speed in which you have subjected me to. It has been eye opening to know you do not want me a
 customer and you do not care how unhappy I am.
 I will be changing my internet server and finally adding cable back. For I did not care about the
 money, but paying for a service and positive customer service that I was not getting. I do not enjoy
 change, but when forced - I will rise to the occasion.

 Secondly, with the passing of Net Neutrality, aren't data caps considered a violation of the policies that were just passed? Isn't Comcast charging customers for different access speeds and treatment just like they were forbidden to do with content providers. Doesn't the same standard apply to any person or device accessing the internet whether it is an individual or not?

 This request was closed and merged into request #217328 ""Re-Complain against comcast tele...""."
1725,"Comcast is placing fabricated charges on my credit score. I do not and have not had service with
 comcast since 2006. I left with -0- bill and am shocked they continued to bill me after service was
 terminated and tech removed equipmet.
 It only shows their desperation for other consumers finances."
1726,"So I ran into financial hardship but told Comcast I would still pay, I asked for the ""minimum"" need to
 restore my service. The rep I chatted with said $50 something. I said are you sure? She said yes. I
 paid, she restored it. The next day, services was interrupted again. I called this time, the rep said I
 was misinformed and now I owe another $100 before they can restore services. At this time I'm
 pissed, and told them their customer service is ridiculous!
 Next month, one day past my due date I asked if I can make a payment of the minimum for $170 in a
 week, the rep said yes and makes the arrangements and ensures me my services won't be
 interrupted. Later that day, my internet is shut off but keep in mind my phone and cable is still on so I
 called and the rep transfer me to a collection rep who then says the rep I chatted with earlier didn't
 give me correct information. That they cannot restore my internet until I arrange to pay $340 in a
 week. I said obviously I didn't have the funds for $170 so that's why I called for an arrangement, she
 then says she cannot do anything for me. At this point I'm furious and tells her it's NOT my fault the
 rep gave me incorrect info. We already agreed! I requested a manager, whom she claimed is out until
 the next day and will have to call me back. I said there has to be more than 1 manager! She again
 cuts me off and says she cannot help me so I hang up. Called back and asked for a manager and
 was transfer to the escalation team, who reviews all the notes and says they will honor the original
 arrangement and keep my services on.
 I understand they're just trying to collect their money but all the BS I've had to deal with over the last
 10 years with Comcast overbilling, overcharging, interrupting services, adding services I don't need,
 and false info is really starting to get me to look at other companies. I keep giving them the benefit of
 the doubt that maybe, just maybe they will improve!"
1727,"Comcast/Xfinity offers several bundle packages for cable TV, Internet, and telephone. However,
 customers cannot find out the pricing for these packages. They only advertise the pricing for New
 Customers and upgrades. If you are a current customer, you cannot find out what the basic pricing is
 for the services offered. They want you to sign a contract to get a discount, but if you do not sign a
 contract you have NO idea what the price will be. Shouldn't customers be able to find out the basic
 prices for the packages without having to sign a contract?"
1728,"Comcast is currently blocking HBOGO on Video Game Consoles with no good reasonible explanation. Meanwhile wireless carriers like ATT and Verizon allows their broadband users to access HBO GO on their Playstaion 4 and Xbox 1.

1730,"So I had my first service with Comcast set up around June of 2014. I was paying $66.95 for performance internet with a $36.96 service discount as part of the promotion. The reason why i decided to set up this service with Comcast was because the comcast representative who help me set up the account informed me that i can call back to have promotion add into my service once again after it expire in 12 months. Now 12 months past, my bill went up to $81.49 from $44.99. I called Comcast, the representative throw me some nice greeting sentenses and said there it nothing he can do. He told me he can't help with my billing becuase it is not an option showing up in his computer. He made it sounds like it is none of his busincess that I was misinformed, and I just have to live with it and pay for it. The worse thing is he then ask me if I am interested in adding a TV cable service. What a company!

1731,"The only decent connection in my area, Comcast, has been throttling our internet connection at ""peak"" hours, around 7pm-12am, everyday for at least the past year and a half. All the phone calls I've made to support ended up as a quick reboot of my cable modem and then a quick usher of telling my and my family that there should be improvements to my connection over the next few days. I'm pretty sure that Comcast has set up some network congestion policy in the area of Florin, CA. There is no problem with that, but during these ""peak"" hours, my family and I have problems with just trying to load a search result from google and I think that is acceptable.
 So, I'm requesting help to get this issue resolved because we've been paying the full price for many years already but we get sub optimal internet speeds and also poor service in response to this problem that I've been bringing up constantly over the years. So if at all possible, please help us get Comcast to stop throttling our connection, effectively preventing us from doing the most basic internet tasks. Even outside of peak hours, we rarely get half indicated speed. Feel free to contact me for any additional information and thank you for taking your time to consider this request
 P.S. I would also like to add that although Comcast recently upgraded their performance tier ,in which we're currently paying for, in California to 75Mbps, http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/news-feed/2-gig-internet-california, our household only gets a fraction of that speed during peak hours, typically 10Mbps or lesser but more often than not around 5Mbps.

1732,"I don't have any solid proof to provide since I haven't been logging the information but however it seems like almost every other night (around 12AM PST to 3AM,), the internet speed would be extremely unstable. My ping when playing video games would be usually consistent around the 30-60ms range but however during the nights where it would be ""laggy"", it would jump any where from between 200-400ms. Normally I would understand if it is during peak hours but this is at 12AM at night. I would double check if I have any downloads going in the background and confirm that my roommates are sleeping (they don't leave their laptops on overnight) but still fail to find the cause to poor connection.
 I play a lot of online video games at night so as soon as the connection gets a bit jumpy, I would know right away. This has been happening for a while now but if I had to estimate, it would be a couple months now.
 If it would help, I'm going to find a reliable source to test my connection and provide more information as I gather them.

 Dear FCC
 I filed a complaint with the FCC regarding Comcast/Xfinity’s “low income program” Comcast/Xfinity
 are refusing to provide this program to “low income” disabled persons, while providing it to other
 persons. Comcast/Xfinity are arbitrarily rescinding their low income internet offer, discriminating
 against persons with disabilities.
 I received a phone call from Comcast/Xfinity. The person identified themselves as “responding to the
 low income program complaint”
 I informed the person, that despite being “low income” on SSI, meeting Federal Poverty Guidelines
 (FPL) and able to supply proof of the same with an SSI verification letter, the “low income internet
 program offer” from Comcast/Xfinity was being rescinded by Comcast/Xfinity.
 This person went on to insist I purchase Comcast/Xfinity’s $27.00 a month service which is not their
 “low income internet program offer” of $9.95 a month.
 I informed them that I believe they are engaging in discrimination against disabled persons creating
 barriers to prevent disabled persons with low incomes access to the internet. These barriers are a
 prohibited act under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)
 Thank you for your attention to this matter.
 Sincerely

When I can use video streaming services, the quality of the video is absolutely unacceptable. It is grainy and pixelated.

1739,"For approximately 1 week (~29 Mar 15 - 3 Apr 15), my internet connection (as well as television) repeatedly lost connectivity. This was not isolated to my home or an internal issue - the Xfinity app indicated that there was an outage in my area each time and that it was being worked on.
 It became very difficult to work remotely, either by using my VPN for telework or my VOIP telephone to connect to conference calls.
 I reached out to Comcast over social media (Twitter - @ComcastCares, which is an amusing handle for a company which clearly does not) twice during the week, and received no response either time, which only served to further aggravate me.
 The last thing we need is for Comcast to become even larger and have even less competition than currently exists. In my area, Comcast is the only high-speed internet provider available if one uses the 25mbps+ definition and excludes poor substitutes (i.e. satellite). Verizon is the only other wired provider, but they currently won't even sell DSL to my location (which is downtown). They used to, at speeds up to 3 or possibly 6mpbs - in other words, practically useless. Comcast needs to focus on properly serving existing customers and providing services for which those customers have paid.
 I am attaching screenshots of one outage from the Xfinity app.

1741,"Comcast is charging me an Early Termination Fee for a contract that I never agreed to. I had been a customer of theirs for about 4 years and been on numerous ""promotional"" offers, and this was always on a month-to-month basis. In March of this year I called to upgrade my tv package, and at no time during the call did the customer service rep mention that this involved a 2-year agreement. Or at least I did not hear them say that. I certainly did not give verbal agreement, nor did I sign anything. If I had understood that they were requiring a 2-year contract I never would have agreed to upgrade my service.
 I have called them twice now, and spent more than an hour trying to get this resolved. The first phone call, the rep said they would pull up and review the call in which I supposedly agreed to this contract and get back to me.
 After 5 days of not hearing from them, I called again yesterday and I was referred to 3 different departments, and finally the last person said they were having computer issues and were not able to produce the call. And yet, they maintain I still was under contract and must pay the ETF charge ($230) before they would reconnect me with internet service.
 So I am without internet service and am being held hostage to a contract I never entered into.
 This is outrageous behavior, and should not be allowed. My only alternative is to go with DSL from the phone company, but of course this involves waiting at least another week and investing in a DSL modem (whereas I currently own a relatively new cable modem). This is not a competitive environment - not in the least.
 The FCC should immediately determine broadband internet service a public utility subject to rate of return regulation, as well as other regulations that prohibit the cable company from behaving this way.

1742,"Since the beginning of April, my internet has been getting dropped. It would work at times, and then dropped the connection at random times. After a week, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I got online with comcast REP and they supposedly resolve my issue. After 3 hours, the connection dropped again, got online again the 2nd time, the REP saw that I was getting a weak signal from their lines. They supposedly did something, and said it was fixed. It was late that night, so the next day. The internet dropped again, 3rd time I got onto comcast REP again, they said it was due to a possible line issue. They would send a tech out onsite to investigate the lines on Saturday. So Saturday came by, the tech was onsite. Came into the room, and did a test. He then concluded that it might be the connection in the line. He proceeded to replace the connection. After doing so, he tested the line again and still a bad signal. He then went outside the apartment complex and changed the connection out there. He then noticed after changing it, he saw that the signal was a lot better. He confirmed that it was due to the outside box that was giving me issues. After a week later, I get Comcast bill. I noticed a 70 dollar fee. I contacted Comcast immediately to explain why I was being charged 70 dollars. They told me because it was due to the inside job. I told them I was not told that I would be charged through the entire 4 times, that I've communicated with their Comcast rep and tech. Also that the issue was the outside box. The comcast REP that chatted with has told me that there was nothing he can do to reveres the fee.

On all 3 occasions, no one showed up and when I called to ask what happened, I was told the ticket was closed. They told me the technician resolved the issue and closed the ticket. No one ever came to my home, even though an appointment was confirmed for the service appointment each time. The Comcast agents were not helpful and only offered to reschedule with explanation as to why a technician did not show up. Calling 1-800-Comcast and chatting with customer service yielded the same result. I continue to have issues with my Internet service and this has been going on for 3 weeks.

1748,"I have been a customer of Comcast for using the Internet Service they provide.
 My Account Number with them is .
 I had requested them to disconnect their service at my Apartment in July 2014. ( They claim that they have no records about it. )
 My Account Number from University Credit Union Bank was assigned on an Auto-pay. I assumed that my account has been disconnected and my card is not being charged. I had not been using any of their equipment or services from them since July 2014.
 I only figured out yesterday Apr. 22.2015 that my account is being charged, since Jul 2014 until April 2015. Upon getting to know this, I immediately called the customer care to inquire about it and asked them to terminate their service (which they probably did not in Jul 2014. ) I explained to them what has happened and they said I have an equipment with me which I need to return and that is the reason why I was being charged. ( The point being, I never used that equipment and they also never sent me a letter, or an email or a phone call that they needed it back and I was being charged for it. ) They said they will only reimburse me for last 3 months.
 I went to the Comcast store at 1795 E, Holladay Murray Rd. in Salt Lake City, UT. on Apr 22, 2015 and also today 23, 2015 to return the equipment ( this equipment was returned the same way it was arrived, it was never used) . Firstly, the employees over there, do not respond normally and have a sense of arrogance in the way they talk. They said, they could do nothing about re-imbursing my account from Jul 2014 to Apr 2015. And I should talk to the supervisor over the phone as their supervisor was busy.
 After, multiple holding over the phone I got to the supervisor and he said that he also could not do anything and would re-imburse the money for last 3 months.
 My request is to have the money back from Jul 2014 to whatever has been charged until Apr 2015 from them as I was not using their service. I am an International Student at University of Utah and all the money that has gone to them for their un used service is hard earned money. Please help me, in resolving this.

She has read articles that if she calls in to Comcast they’ll reduce her rate, but when she calls in they won’t reduce her rate. They won’t give her new customer rates. She called customer service to do a customer survey one day and they hung up on her 12 times. One time they held her to a contract she never read or signed.

1750,"On April 30th my wife contacted Comcast about moving our service, we were told the process would
 be very simple since the last tenant already had a Comcast account previously. We disconnected our
 equipment and signed the online documents the following day(May 1st 2015).
 We hooked our equipment up May 1st, our internet and phone was working correctly. The following
 day we returned to work to discover the phone was working but our internet was down, we began
 calling Comcast to resolve the issue. We were told they couldn't find our account and the move was
 never processed, after being shuffled around nobody could figure out what was going on with our
 account and nobody could resolve the issue. After a lot of transfers, frustration and explaining the
 situation several times we gave up until Monday.
 Fast forward to Monday May 4th, I arrived to our business to find our phone was still working(They
 couldn't explain how) and the internet was still down. After several phone calls I was finally able to
 schedule an appointment for them to send someone out. After the first window was missed I called
 Comcast again, they claimed the service tech had arrived at our business and all of the doors were
 shut and nobody was there. That was completely untrue, I was at work all day and we had our painter
 here remodeling, our front door was wide open. They scheduled another appointment. A couple of
 hours later we received a call from a ""blocked"" number(on our Comcast phone that according to them
 shouldn't be working) saying it was dispatch, they couldn't send a technician out as the account didn't
 exist and we still had service at our previous location, she couldn't do anything for us and told us to
 call the toll free number back.
 We called back again. I spoke with a very friendly customer service representative who was baffled
 by the account and how things have been handled, I expressed our frustrations and our desires to
 stay with Comcast but nobody could give us any answers and nobody could fix the issue.
 He was very apologetic and transferred us to cancellations at our request.
 Cancellations was even worse, the woman I spoke with claimed we couldn't cancel our account
 unless we paid the 70% remaining on our contract, I tried to explain the situation and how we've been
 trying to resolve the issue since the first of May. She said there was nothing she could do to correct
 the mistake and I would have to contact someone in sales, I told her we had spoke with sales several
 times and been transferred several times and every person said there was nothing they could do,
 somehow we were disconnected after that.
 Today's date is May 7th, we've spoke with more representatives, supervisors, cancellation techs,
 dispatchers than we can count, nobody has been able to explain whats going on and nobody is willing
 to get to the bottom of it. Our first phone call was a week ago and we still have no resolution, we run a
 business that needs a quick internet connection and reliable service, not only have they hurt our
 business but they've wasted countless hours of our time and we're still sitting here with no internet
 connection to run our business. I will never do business with this company again and be sure to steer
 others away from using them for business related services."

1752,"Comcast is charging me $77.64 a month for XFINITY Internet service. The approximate speeds I currently get are commonly less than 40mbps down and 7mbps up. Google Fiber provides internet speeds of 1000mbps up and 1000mbps down for approximately $70 a month. If I were to pay Google for the bandwidth I am receiving from Comcast, I would be paying about $3. I am receiving speeds 20x slower for the same cost. Very uncompetitive.
 Additionally, no other Comcast service exists for less money for similar bandwidth. If you try to reduce your bill, they will offer you faster internet, but only if you ""bundle"" with their TV services. I don't watch TV. TV doesn't matter to me.
 Also, my Internet price has increased from a promotional ~$30 to ~$76 a month for the same speeds and equipment. Even at $30, the cost is overpriced by over 10x Google Fiber's cost.

1753,"Where I live, I essentially have 2 options for broadband internet, Comcast and Century Link. Century link is roughly the same cost as Comcast for 1/2 the speed. So that narrows my options to only Comcast. I ordered the residential internet package from Comcast. My family was very excited to finally have an internet connection that would allow us to watch Netflix, so we immediately signed up. It was fantastic, tons of tv shows and movies available at the push of a button. I work full time and my wife stays home with our son. We had Netflix on and streaming most of the day. Towards the end of the month I started receiving notices from Comcast about going ""over"" the alloted bandwidth. Needless to say I was surprised by the letter because Comcast advertised it as ""unlimited"". It turns out it is ""unlimited"" as long as you stay under 250 Gigabytes a month. Comcast's defense to this is that only a small percentage of people go over this limit.
 When you consider that Netflix seemed to stream at the rate of roughly 1 Gigabyte an hour, you can exceed that cap with 250 hours of Netflix alone! This doesn't count in Youtube videos, web browsing, gaming, and any other online activities.
 After receiving several of these notices, I received one that stated if I went over again my service would be terminated. I called in to see what options were available to me. The only options I had were to cut ties with Comcast completely, or sign a 3 year contract and pay more to ""upgrade"" to business class internet. So now not only do I pay more per month but due to the contract I was forced to sign I am locked in for 3 years.

1757,"I was in need of high speed internet for my home and decided to give Comcast a try. Initially I was told by one of their reps that all I needed to do was to buy a modem/router from their ""list of approved devices"" and self install it. I bought the device on 4-12-15 and that same day found out that I wasn't going to be able to self install. Not a big deal, I went ahead and scheduled an installation for the upcoming Wednesday of 4-15-15. On the day of installation the tech shows up and tells me he won't be able to install because he requires additional tools/gear to do this particular job. He asks me when would be a good day for a re-schedule and I tell him Monday 4-20-15 between 4pm - 6pm because I was going to be out of town up until that time. The tech confirms Monday 4-20-15 between 4-6 and leaves. The very next day I receive a phone call from one of their sales reps who initially tells me that he's calling to confirm my installation for internet for Monday 4-20-15 between 2pm - 4pm. I tell him that's incorrect and that the installation was rescheduled for a later time frame, the 4pm - 6pm specifically because I wasn't going to be home any earlier than that. The rep listened to me, then apologized and confirmed that the installation was indeed going to happen at the correct time. After that he began continuously pressuring me to sign up for their television package on top of the internet that I was going to get. At first I respectfully declined but the rep would not give up and continued to try and make me sign up, I had to repeat myself 5 times telling him that I wasn't interested and finally had to raise my voice to get him to leave me alone, only then did he finally give up, it was ridiculous! Now the weekend was coming to an end, Sunday 4-19-15 around 7 pm I received an automated phone call from Comcast reminding me about my installation that was supposed to take place the following day but instead of the correct time frame of 4pm - 6pm (that I had confirmed with TWO of their reps) the automated system again tells me that it's going to happen between 2pm - 4pm......I AGAIN called their service desk, the rep I talked to this time had no clue what I was talking about, after I had explained to him what was going on he offered to reschedule my installation to Wednesday 4-22-15 at 4pm - 6pm, this was now pushing the installation back an additional two days! I said that wasn't going to work and that I was now upset that their company had made this mistake repeatedly. The rep then tells me to hold on while he sees whether or not he can do something for me, without any notice I then get transferred to someone else, a lady who claimed she had no idea why I was transferred to her or what was going on for that matter. This was an outrage, I asked to speak to a supervisor, the lady told me to wait, she then put me on a brief hold and came back a few minutes later saying that a supervisor will now talk with me, then I began hearing the music you usually hear when you're on hold, I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and after that I was hung up on!! no one ever picked up, no one ever talked to me, I couldn't believe it. I called back upset, asked to speak to a supervisor again, this time the rep tells me that there is only one supervisor on duty and that he's busy at the moment but if I wanted to leave my number then I would receive a call the next day.....I was shocked at the poor quality of service this company was providing me, and all of this happened in the very beginning stages before I was even fully signed up for their internet service. I canceled the installation all together and proceeded to file a complaint directly on their website only to receive an
 email in return apologizing for the inconvenience they have caused me and telling me that they hope to still provide me with their services in the future. They weren't personable, they weren't sincere and they never offered any kind of resolution to the issue at hand. Typically in this situation there is a very necessary phone call that needs to take place along with an attempt to fix their mistakes and try to keep me as a customer, but no, all I got was their generic email and a huge waste of 8 days during which I was under the impression that I was going to get internet service from them.

Even though after requesting them so many times nothing has been done and our internet still doesn't work at all and we are still paying all our dues on time for something which doesn't work. We being students cannot afford to buy another service provider since we have to pay a deposit plus we do not get that much time also since we have so many assignments.

1759,"I am currently on the phone with Comcast Internet Support. This is the third time in a week that I have
 had to call. Each time they have started out blaming me and/or my equipment for the problems. On
 the current call the representative tried to tell me that my modem was out of date, when I was
 insistent that it was the correct modem, after 5 minutes of conversation where I read off the serial,
 model number and type of modem, she kept saying it was out of date. I pointed out to her that I used
 the same Comcast supplied modem for 10 years and the only reason I bought my own was because
 Comcast themselves said mine was adequate and they would not replace it without a charge. Once I
 said all that, she relented and said I did have the correct modem. The representative and I went
 round and round about the issue, and during the time I talked to her, my internet came up to full
 speed but when I asked if I was being throttled down, she said no. When I asked to speak to a
 supervisor (which I have been on hold for 5 minutes so far) my internet went off again.
 I can gather from her original line of questioning that she wanted me to start renting a Comcast
 supplied modem.
 Because of where I live, I do not have any other options for high-speed internet access. I am forced to
 put up with unreliable service which I pay $80.00 a month for and have no recourse to get anything
 fixed. I have read complaints about Broadband providers and Comcast has the most negative
 comments so far. Poor service (meaning it is never what you are paying for), horrible customer
 service, which I just experienced and ridiculous business practices. I realize this probably won't have
 any effect on Comcast, but I was tired of putting up with horrible service without doing something."
1760,"To whom it may concern:
 I have internet service with Comcast, and I am writing to let you know about my frustration with both
 the internet service and the customer service.
 I called Comcast customer service today because I am having internet speed issues; this is an issue
 that I have had ever since I started with Comcast, and in the past, none of the tech support people
 has truly resolved the issue for me. I had to make 3 calls today:
 - Call #1: I was working with a tech support person; we were doing some tests, and he suggested
 that the issue could be the modem, and I should consider getting a modem replaced. He said he
 would call me if we were disconnected during testing. I explained to him that I was calling on a VoIP
 line and gave him my cell phone number. He asked me to hang up, and he will call me on my cell
 phone. He never called back.
 - Call #2: After not receiving a call-back from tech support guy #1, I called again. After going through
 the numerous voice-prompt menu options, my call was picked up and disconnected/dropped for no
 apparent reason, and I was forced to call a third time.
 - Call #3: The third call was most the infuriating. The tech support lady had a poorly command of
 English, and she clearly didn't know what she was doing. She put me on hold repeatedly while she
 was trying to figure out what to do. I explained to her that I already went through the testing during
 Call #1, and I just want to find out how to get the modem replaced. She finally figured out how to
 send the modem and told me that I would need to pay $15 for shipping. I challenged her on the
 shipping charge: I pay a monthly fee to rent the modem from Comcast, and it make no sense that I
 would have to pay for shipping for a replacement if the equipment Comcast is renting to me is
 defective. At this point, I was absolutely fed up with her incompetence, and I demanded to speak with
 her supervisor. I asked her specifically when I should expect a call from her supervisor, and I was
 told it would be within 30 minutes. Guess what? I didn't get a call from the supervisor.
 I am very frustrated with Comcast for the following reasons:
 1. Poor internet connection: Comcast/Xfinity brags about the speed of its service constantly on TV.
 It sure would be nice if the company actually delivers on what it claims.
 2. Poor customer service: Comcast customer service and tech support people are poorly trained and
 not customer-centric. Why should any customer have to make 3 calls in one day, and still not have
 the issue resolved?
 Furthermore, I think it is ridiculous that I am being asked to pay for shipping on the replacement
 modem. If the modem that Comcast is renting me is defective, then why I am responsible for the
 shipping of the replacement modem?
 I would like to ask you to investigate these poor business practices at Comcast.

1761,"I frequently get less that 25Mpbs internet, usually in the 3Mbps range. Most of my neighbors get the
 same. I've complained when I initially signed up, but was never able to get it rectified.
 Comcast keeps calling me and offering 50Mbps for ""only $4 a month more"". Then I spend 5 minutes
 arguing with them about how I can't even get what I pay for.
 Honestly, I've NEVER dealt with a more disreputable, dishonest, incompetent company in my life. I'm
 working on having my multi-unit building moved to a new provider in the area, but I just wanted to file
 this complaint for the record."
1762,"China Advocates, a small business, moved from San Francisco to Santa Rosa on March 26. We contacted Comcast, our internet service provider on March 19th to verify that they could provide service at our new location. The sales rep, Karen Milspaugh (303)784-7286, used her system to check and was able to verify that they would be able to offer service in our new location. Our real estate agent didn't think they could service our new building so I called Karen to check on this again and she said that she had checked their system so their would be no problems, this was on March 23. Karen assisted me in executing a new contract for the remainder of our service in the new location and scheduled the technician to install on March 27. When the technician came to the new location to install service I was informed after some time that they would not be able to provide service to our building. We then called to make sure we would not be further billed for service at our old location that we are no longer using, and the Comcast rep told us that it was our choice to move to a location where they do not offer service and that we are still bound to pay for our original contract or a 75% of the remainder of our contract, a total cancellation fee of over $2,000. This was not our mistake it was theirs, and their poor information and practices lead to us loosing over 3 days worth of business productivity with no internet service in our new location. China Advocates should not be made to pay for a mistake that was not ours. We would like to submit this claim and request that you intervene on our behalf to help us as a small business and get Comcast to relinquish us from any further payments on non-existing service. We feel we also have a valid counter claim against Comcast and that they should pay us $1,000 towards our loss of productivity over the 3 days when we had to wait for a new provider to come and install service in our new location.

Gradually they have hiked up the prices every year when I renew my subscription wtih them. Now the price is a astounding $119.99 for triple play services. This does not include tax and rental fees.
 Also for a long time I have not seen Comcast try to promote their services not bundled. I would like to be able to pay a reasonable rate for just interent alone but Comcast charges 2/3 of the bundled price to discourage me of just using their interent alone.

1767,"2014 thru 2015 I was paying 95.82 a month for internet and cable service. Towards the end of Feb I was informed my contract was about to expire. A new contract would cost $127.00 a month. I informed them as a senior and on a fixed budget this amount was to much. I was informed there was an offer $87.00 plus tax and fees for 2 years which included everything. I accepted. Then on June 9, 2015 I got a letter from Comcast stating they neglected to collect $10.00 a month for the modem. Thus the new figure would be $127.00 a month the initial quoted figure.
 Comcast lied. Their intention all along was to collect the 127.0. Why did it take 3 months time after I signed the contract to notify me the modem wasn't included which was pass the 3 day I could opt our of the contract. Comcast acted in bad faith. I don't feel I owe the $135.00 requested.

1768,"For over 3 years I have been going back and forth with Comcast over their billing practices. To let you know, I'm a 37 year old IT professional that does Hardware/Software testing as a day job, so I'm more than knowledgeable when It comes to matters of how things work.
 Now because I know better, I buy my own modems to avoid the horrendous over-charged modem ""rental"" fees. (7$ monthly, 84$ annually where a modem is about 60-70$ to purchase outright) . Without fail, every 3-6 months Comcast will add the modem rental fee to my bill without warning or disclosure. Unless I read the fine print in the service sub-section of the bill (If one even gets paper bills). I will then make my regular 3-4 hour (over 3 attempts) call to Comcast Customer Service where i'm regularly hung up on, given false/conflicting/or technically impossible answers to simple questions like, ""Can you explain how this charge was added to my bill?""
 Above all that, they make me pay 84.00 monthly for just the basic tier cable modem service. I would love to jump ship from these asshats and their terrible service, but because they were allowed to become such a monopoly San Francisco has ZERO alternative to these greedy individuals.
 Please help the people of this country be shifting the power back to the people who spend and consume and keep this country running. Thanks for listening!

 I signed up for a $54.99 plan with Comcast and am being billed $70. I've had conversations with them (which I have recorded) saying that they will be charging $54, and they keep billing me the increased amount.

1770,"I was attempting to sign up for new service with Comcast. I cannot locate the following information on the Comcast website, even after expanding the ""learn more"" and ""pricing and other info"" boxes. I attempted to contact a chat agent, but all the agent did was ask a bunch of irrelevant questions.
 1. What is the quoted upload speed for any of the plans shown?
 2. How does my speed change after 12 months for the plans shown? For example, there's a plan with a ""Blast upgrade"" that expires after 12 months. If I wanted to keep that, what do I pay? The ""pricing"" link merely quotes a range that depends by area, even though I had to type my zipcode in to reach the page.
 3. What is the price after 12 months? Again, the ""pricing"" link is really unclear on that.
 I hope the FCC can standardize how this information is presented, much like how credit card offers got standardized, because this is on the verge of being willfully misleading.

1781,"Dear Mr. Demarco,
 I wish to write this complaint concerning how my account at , San Jose, Ca 95148 was horribly mishandled my your customer service staff.
 On 30 March 2015, I called the local San Jose customer service department and informed them that I was terminating my account, cable, internet and landline effective immediate. I was asked why and I simply stated that a competitor can provide the same service for $100 per month less. I had a financial incentive to switch.
 I was not informed at that time that I had a three year contract with my security system nor that I should return all equipment within a day.
 On 31 March 2015 a new provider installed all equivalent capabilities at my home including security service. On April 1, 2015, I paid my account in full which was due April 4 , 2015.
 On April 17, 2015, I called your 800 customer service center because I received an email that my account was due over $1000. I was informed that all of my account had yet to be closed. I waited over 30 minutes, nothing was done, I just heard background noise for 10 more minutes until I finally hung up the phone.
 I immediately came to your local center with my equipment. I was told that all accounts were still open and that if I terminated my security service I would owe $675 for early termination. If I continued until November 2015 I would just owe $40 a month until November ($320). I opted to do that rather than pay this excessive termination fee. My understanding when I signed up for the bundle was that I signed a two year contract not a three year contract.
 Anyways, please close my accounts except for the security service if I will still be charged a $675 early termination fee.
 Your customer service phone service were not helpful in closing my accounts. In fact, they did nothing as of this morning all of my accounts were still open.
 If you continue this lack of follow thru, I can only assume that you will not keep many of your customers no matter what you can offer them.
 Thank you for your time,
 A dissatisfied customer (b) (6)

1782,"Hi there!
 In March, I spent several hours on the phone with multiple Comcast technicians to troubleshoot slow
 internet speeds. Despite paying for their 'Blast Plus' service which advertised 105Mbps down, I had
 consistently been getting ~20Mbps down for months.
 I offered, on multiple occasions, to each technician, to remove my router (which I own) from the
 network path and directly connect to the modem. In every case, the Comcast technicians declined
 and told me this was unnecessary.
 At the end of the call, they said I would need a Comcast technician to come out and check signal
 strength and wiring to further diagnose the problem. At no point did they verbally indicate a fee would
 be associated with the visit. As I was unaware of a possible charge at the time, I consented.
 Although there were minor signal strength problems related to the way the Comcast technician had
 originally configured our internet cabling, the problem turned out to indeed be the router (which I had
 suspected, and why I offered to test it the day before). This claim was therefore marked as my fault,
 and I was charged $70.
 After several frustrating attempts to have this bill waived, the best I could do was a $35 refund on the
 cost, which I find fully unacceptable. The fee should be waived in it's entirety, and in fact I should be
 compensated for the multiple hours I spent on the phone with Comcast on what was ultimately a
 diagnosis I could have made myself, but which they refused to acknowledge.
 Thank you,"
1783,"went to comcast at 5pm
 asked for box, didn't respond
 then laughing
 I've had Comcast service since last September 2014 and on record, I have called at least almost
 once a week since then which would amount to at least 36 calls made all based on repeated lack of
 customer service. It was my mistake to think Comcast is superior to ATT, however I probably
 would've had an easier time if I had just gone with ATT. I've threatened to cancel my Comcast
 internet service time and time again. I solved the problem that comcast couldn't. Paying for high
 speed and not being able to load even ""WWW.GOOGLE.COM"" within even a few hours is insanity. I
 should not have to wait hours for a single web page to load every other week or so. Meanwhile,
 comcast freely takes your money and doesn't even compensate for the amount of time spent and
 paid for the service that was never ""actually"" offered. I have basically learned enough from the
 countless phone calls about broken service in disrepair that I could possibly become a Comcast
 technician. I've obtained more than enough training obtaining various bits of knowledge from the
 revolving door of mediocre service technicians that have been through my house. Had I known I
 would have to become a student and learn from Comcasts mistakes to fix my own, I would've
 immediately ran towards ATT. I've had at least 5 or 10 different routers and modems that have failed
 or just completely given up. Without my constant proactive approach to this problem dealing with the
 horror show that comcast likes us to call ""customer service"", I would've never fixed my internet
 problem that began within the first week of subscribing to comcast. Almost 250 days later and I am
 unhappy to say that I am the only reason my internet is now working like a normal internet should be,
 and for what I've already paid, I will never get back the money spent over the past 9 months where
 the majority of the time I either spent days upon days calling comcast customer service only to be
 disappointed immediately afterwards with service failures or to be hopeful that the next comcast
 technician would fix the problem, which they never did. Each technician knew bits and pieces of how
 to best make the internet work along with their different personalities. One of the technicians came
 over and almost wanted to leave right away without actually doing any work at all. Just yesterday I
 went to comcast in Foster City, CA (999 Edgewater Blvd, Foster City, CA 94404) and spoke with a
 woman named ""Adriana"" who didn't answer any of my questions despite asking twice initially. She
 failed to acknowledge that we are the customer, and she is the worker. She was basically ignoring me
 and my other friend who also subscribes to comcast and just doing whatever she thought made
 sense to her. I specifically asked for the dual band modem and she responded with ""what? i don't
 know what you're talking about?"" and passed it off as ignorantly as she could. How am I, the
 customer, supposed to respond to that? Do I have to guide the worker on what needs to be done? I
 had to come back a second time where even the manager was rude. I came back to the store almost
 15 minutes later and saw there was one woman employee named ""Adriana"", and her manager
 named ""Sonia"". Adriana was helping a customer. Sonia, the manager in charge, was processing
 other items possibly to finish up her work so she could go home since it was close to closing time.
 The manager yelled at me and said ""I am closed, she will help you"". I responded with ""You're
 employee gave me the wrong item when I came in not too long ago"". She said to wait for Adriana to
 finish up with the ""one and only single"" customer in there. Not to mention, I was also unfairly treated
 and ignored which resulted in ending up with the wrong cable modem box unit. The second time I
 came in, ""Adriana"" almost laughed at me because she couldn't understand why I was furious. The
 other thing that made it even worse and more infuriating was that another ""white"" gentleman walked
 in and the manager quickly got herself together and said ""Oh, I can help you in a minute"". How am I
 supposed to feel about this? This is basically racism. Comcast is a hopeless company to me and
 everyone I meet. I will continue to spread the word and possibly file a few more complaints. Why not?
 Comcast doesn't seem to mind handing out loads of ignorance and attitude so I guess will yell from
 now on every time I come in the store since that seems to be the only thing that might work. Even
 then, it may not. How crazy is this? I will be filing on various other websites and basically anywhere I
 can from now on. This story will not go unheard. Comcast owes me at LEAST over 6 months of solid
 free internet service for the way I've had to take things on so crazily, that I even know how a Comcast
 technician works and goes about his day. I the customer should not have to know these things so
 detailed however I don't even work for COMCAST!?!??! WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER!?!? NO
 THANK YOU!! I WOULD RATHER GO WITH ATT!!!! Comcast might've created a monopoly in San
 Jose, CA silicon valley, but I will not be made an example of. No sir. Not me."
1784,"Going on a business trip to Estes Park, CO and staying at the YMCA Rockies (http://ymcarockies.org/), I signed up myself to a few services at a website which operates their activities' registration: https://apm.activecommunities.com/ymcarockiesepcprograms

 1) create an account,

 On their website, in their FAQ, they even have a question and answer:
 ""How did I sign up for an ACTIVE Advantage trial membership?""
 And their answer is:
 ""When registering online for an activity/event through the ACTIVE Network (including reserving a campsite on Reserve America), you may be presented with the opportunity to try ACTIVE Advantage free for 30 days. This offer is displayed after your registration is complete, but before your registration confirmation page. To opt-in to the trial membership offer, you are required to verify and re-enter your email address, and then select an offer acceptance button. If you are not interested in the Advantage trial membership, you simply have to click ""No Thanks"". With either choice you will then be taken to your registration/reservation confirmation page.
 If you do choose to try the Advantage trial membership, you will receive a trial confirmation email. Half way through your trial membership period you will receive another ""checking in"" email that highlights featured discounts and encourages you to take advantage of the membership benefits. At the end of your 30 day trial we will extend your member benefits for a full year at the then-current
 annual membership fee (currently $64.95) and will send a notification email about the membership status change and billing.
 Of course, you're always protected by our Member Satisfaction Pledge. Even if you decide after your 30 day trial period has ended that you're not satisfied with your membership, just let us know and we'll give you a pro-rated refund for the unused months--no questions asked!""

 From their main page, at the bottom-right, the two links FAQ and Help Center. In the Help Center link (http://activesupport.force.com/usersupport/) you can clearly see they discuss the charges etc., that would appear on one's CC bill.
 The FCC should enact a law that makes it illegal for anyone to use one else's CC information while paying for a service to sign them up for another service.

1785,"My account number with Comcast was , and I closed the account. Each of the two times I called Comcast, I was told the exact same, consistent information; that is, I would receive a refund of $143. I have even recorded the Comcast agents' information --- on September 25, I spoke with Danny (Agent ID: DANAV610), and on August 20, I spoke with George Fanchez (Agent ID: 99100TPG) --- both of them were in the billing department. But, until now (since last year), I have never received a refund of $143.
 <br> <br><br>
 Furthermore, according to what Agatha Hill, Comcast's supervisor, clearly stated below ---
 <br> <br><br>
 ""Dear Ms.
 <br> <br><br>
 Thanks for speaking with this morning in regard to the issues with your previous account, 8155100014492460. I welcome the opportunity to assist with this issue.
 <br> <br><br>
 I have started an investigation in regard to our records indicating that your Chase credit card received two charge backs in the amount of $143.21 on 11/21/2014. Since you indicated that your Chase account only received one charge back of $143.21, there should be nothing more owing to Comcast.
 <br> <br><br>
 As soon as I receive a response back I will provide you with an update. I do not know if I will need a copy of the bank statement to verify that only one charge back was received or not and would appreciate you providing that information in case it is needed.""
 <br> <br><br>
 Agatha did complete the above investigation, and we did provide the credit card proof --- both showed that there had been NO double credits to my card at all.
 <br> <br><br>
 As a result, the matter should be clear, and, in addition, that was what Agatha 'exactly' wrote down 'in black and white'. But the supervisor from Comcast did not want to fulfill what she had written 'in black and white' anymore. She started to lie and change stories by treating us as a fool. She was also taking advantage of us and discriminating against us.
 <br> <br><br>
 What really puzzled us the most was that, in addition to all kinds of human errors and system issues they have, Comcast did not want to be responsible for anything they said or did!

 Please note that the July 2014 billing shows the removal of the extra modem, but it reappears the next month. Comcast 'conveniently' does not allow viewing of billing beyond 1 year. My personal bank account indicates that this double billing went on for some time.

1793,"Like many others now having been signed up with Comcast for many years now (surprisingly even in Silicon Valley they are the only ones that offer adequate cable internet service) the monthly bill I pay for Internet service has continued to rise from the around $40/month initial payment promotion to around $80/month. In many attempts to lower the cost of service I have contacted Comcast directly, often staying on the phone with them for multiple hours trying to cancel my cable TV service (that I have never used, the cable box has never been connected) it seems to essentially be impossible to get them to cancel my TV service. Not only that their practice of bundling Internet and TV services in promotional packages that expire, and never advertising real world prices seems borderline criminal. To get Internet service only (if you can manage to convince the customer service rep after many hours) will cost the user more than getting a bundled package in almost every situation. I have been told by multiple Comcast representatives that they recommend actually calling them back every 6 months or so when my TV/Internet promotion price expires to just call them back to see about renewing that same deal instead of getting Internet only service. Of course in all of these promotions there are many loopholes for them and without question the user ends up back at the usual $80 month or so.
 I find it absurd that Comcast's best solution for customers who want Internet service only is to continuously get tricked into buying a TV/Internet bundle of which the price will be higher than their actual Internet only price. I believe I was told the Internet only price for my current service would be ~$70/month. Each time I have requested Internet only service I am kept on the line for hours until I cave into sticking with a cheaper promotion priced TV/Internet bundle instead.
 I am not sure if it is even possible to get a clear answer on what Comcasts actual Internet only prices are, because they don't even seem to advertise them directly, and overtime I have asked I receive a slightly different answer.
 I believe that any provider of Internet service should be required to have clearly and fairly priced tiers of Internet service that are clearly advertised, and can be purchased and signed up for without any pressure to purchase other services. It goes beyond high pressure sales tactics when customer service reps actually refuse to set you up with Internet only service. Which I have had happen on multiple occasions with Comcast.
 Thank you.

1794,"Our internet connection has been routinely slow for about a year now. There are the occasional moments of somewhat usable speeds, but overall we have been plagued with speeds that are consistently far under what Comcast promises us and routine spikes where the internet becomes unusable as the ping spikes to the thousands and the download and upload plummets to tens of kilobits. Comcast has done nothing in order to rectify the situation and has even attempted to get us off of their case. Every time we go onto the live chat to complain about the speeds we always experience a temporary boost in speeds in order to show us that they are upholding their side of the deal through a speedtest. Furthermore, they have told us multiple to times to press certain buttons on our router in order to ""fix our speeds."" What they fail to tell us is that these speeds reset our router to factory standards and kick us off of the internet and renders us unable to complain for many more hours. Overall we're very unhappy with our speeds and are looking to switch to Google Fiber when it comes around if the problem isn't fixed. Thank you.

 my service was done inappropriately and a service technician setup a dummy email for me without
 giving me the password until November (my 3rd attempt at correcting the situation). This prevented
 both myself and COMCAST from using the phone line to finish setting up any access as I could
 complete installation without online email access and they could not call me on my cell phone (which I
 was forced to maintain the costs because I could not access my home line) only on my VOIP line. I
 was told the matter would be resolved in 48 hours and that I would receive HBO for a year. It wasn't
 and they are billing me for HBO. I called again in December and spent time twice with online
 technicians who tried to resolve the email problem so I could access my account and twice was told it
 a work order would be put in and it would be escalated to solve access issue so I could use my Xfinity
 on computer devices and access by billing account online. This was the same thing I had been told
 in December -- Neither time did it happen. In January, during a fourth attempt, I finally received
 access to my account and my Xfinity computer services. I was again told the HBO billing would be
 corrected and given a $100 credit for the loss of my XFINITY services during the previous fall.
 Comcast also suggested I upgrade to Xfinity Boost to solve my connectivity. I did so but nothing
 changed -- we would still have lengthy outages with no service. Comcast suggested I upgrade to
 their new cable box. This took several month and hours on the phone because the cable box
 provided was defective. Finally I took off work AGAIN and on May 5 a service technician brought a
 new cable box and took the time to make sure it was properly running. However, after he left --
 service was interrupted again. Fortunately, he was checking to make sure our issues were resolved
 and returned 4 hours later admitting that there was still an issue. He checked the wall circuit (no
 problem) and THEN with my son, a former Comcast technician they looked at the line outside the
 house. It had NEVER been replaced in AUGUST 2014 even though I was fradulently billed for it --
 instead it had been SPLICED 3 TIMES. The COMCAST technician replaced the line and voila my
 cable/internet/phone service now work flawlessly. However, COMCAST is not addressing the
 fundamental issue that I was without reliable TELEPHONE/INTERNET/CABLE/EMAIL for 10 months
 even though my bill was being paid because they LIED AND DID NOT REPLACE OUTSIDE LINE
 THAT I WAS BILLED FOR. I requested a full 10 months reimbursement for their FRAUDULENT
 misrepresentation, stress and angst, and HOURS SPENT trying to resolve this matter promply and
 professionally. They do not return phone calls in a timely manner nor have they offered anything but
 $50. I am incredulous and request that they be sanctioned to the fullest extent of the FCC's power.
 They are an abusive monopoly that should be converted to a public utility."
1797,"I called a comcast rep after attempting to set up my home internet. I had everything plugged in correctly and it still wasn't working. The rep told me that sometimes they unplug the connections outside the house when a user disconnects service, and the only way to reconnect it was to send a technician out which I had to pay for. They essentially disconnected the cable so they can charge me for a $100 visit later. When I brought this up, his response was ""well I guess its a type of business practice."" I complained enough and they said they would do it for free, but they wouldn't be able to add the free credit until after the appointment had been charged to my account. The woman promised multiple times that she would call me back a specified time. She denied giving me a phone number to reach her in case she didn't. Guess who never called me?

1798,"Re: Account Number
 On April 14 2015, I requested a service transfer since I was moving to a new home. On Comcast’s webpage I was able to find some very interesting personalized promotions (please see screen shots attached). I decided to go with the internet promotion named Internet Performance which offers 50MBPS of Internet Speed at a price of $19.99 per month. When I reached out to Comcast, I was not able to get this promotion since I was told that was only a promotion for new customers and that Comcast Website was experiencing some technical difficulties.
 I am disappointed because Comcast has offered something and the company is not keeping its promise. As a costumer I have the right to get any plan that the Company offers, and in this case (as you can see from the screenshots below), Comcast is denying something it has already offered. Business is all about trust and keeping promises and in this situation Comcast is failing at both.
 To resolve the problem, I would appreciate that Comcast provides the service I was offered, which is the above mentioned Internet Performance Plan. Enclosed are screenshots of what I was offered by Comcast.

1801,"I am writing to express my concern with Comcast's billing practices related to internet modems after my recent issues with the company. I was able to resolve this issue with Comcast but, after my interactions with the Company, I am very concerned about other consumers being charged incorrect fees on their monthly bills.
 In early June, I received a letter in the mail from Comcast stating that they had made a mistake and forgot to charge me a monthly ($10) fee for renting a modem and that they would begin charging me the monthly fee on my next bill. This was an error on Comcast's part because I own my cable modem and do not rent any internet equipment from Comcast. My first step in resolving this issue was to do an online ""chat"" through Comcast's website with a customer service representative. Instead of trusting a customer who has been with the Company for more than 3 years and who has never missed a bill payment, I was asked to prove that I owned the modem by providing a receipt. When I could not produce a receipt (for an item costing less than $100 and purchased more than 3 years ago), I was told that Comcast would have to investigate the matter and would get back to me within 7 days. I did not hear back from Comcast within their 7 day time frame and I sent an email to their customer service email. After emailing customer service, Comcast confirmed that the modem I use is owned by me and that the mistake was caused by some kind of clerical error.
 My concern with Comcast's modem billing practices are the following:
 1. The letter notifying me of the monthly lease fee was sent in a plain envelope and can easily be misidentified as another piece of junk mail that is sent frequently from Comcast for telephone services, home protection, etc.
 2. Comcast puts the burden of proof on the consumer to prove they own their equipment. I am unaware of any other company or industry where it is acceptable to ask customers for proof of ownership. If Comcast truly believes it owns equipment in a customer's possession, the onus to produce a receipt or invoice should be on them.
 3. Comcast did not resolve the matter within their own stated 7 day time frame and I was required to follow up with the company to get this matter resolved.
 4. Based on a Google search, this is a very common Comcast practice. I was able to find hundreds of forum postings and complaints online about Comcast trying to charge monthly fees for customer owned modems. In many cases, it seems Comcast will not refund modem fees even after customers prove they own their modems.
 My intent for writing this complaint is to alert the FCC of what seems like a very common billing mistake/practice by Comcast and to express my concern that there are a high number of Comcast customers incorrectly (and unaware of) being charged monthly fees.
 Regards,

1802,"I was subscribed to Comcast for a simple Basic+HD television cable service and for basic cable broadband service. I decided to stop the cable TV channel subscriptions, as I watch very little TV and cna get most of it from local off-the-air broadcasts. In response, Comcast jacked up my internet bill to make it exactly equal the price I had been paying for TV and Internet beforehand. It seems unfair that I should pay the same amount for considerably less service.

1806,"I also filed this complaint under your phone. It is about phone, Internet and TV service all through Comcast. Complaints in all these areas.
 Around 4 years ago had an internet connection into my living room. Tech decided best way from bedroom since it was a shared wall. Tech did work and
 replaced furniture. Never saw the work. During the last several years had 4 or 5 DVR boxes fail. One box given me had recordings on it. Internet always slow. Asked if upgrades in street and connections to house have been done. Can't understand all the failures I keep experiencing. Couple years ago start remodeling. Painters ask me who did the work behind the bedroom TV and Computer desk. Holes in wall, plates won't stay on wall because the Tech made the connections too long, stuffed all wiring in wall, but then plates on either side of wall were not connected. After some remodeling completed called Comcast about it and asked for a tech to see about adding a connection in a spare bedroom ( new office conversion). Tech came out, said to go wireless and leave everything in place. Looked at previous work, took pictures, sent to supervisor, can be corrected but not on his work order, will have to call Comcast back to get another tech out to correct. Continue to experience cable problems ( have to reset box often), slow Internet, keep asking people I talk to Comcast is it possible the lines in the street aren't updated, why so many failures, etc. Have some family emergencies, call Comcast a few months ago about the damaged wall ( see attachments) please send someone to fix it ( last tech said it could be fixed). Tech comes says there is nothing can be done. Tie up a few wires, put on plates which don't fit flesh against the wall because everything is stuffed in the wall. June 1st wake up to no phone service or Internet service. Spend close to 4 hours on the phone repeating all the issues I have had, the service calls, DVR resets, etc. I need service. Can't get anyone out until June 2. Tech went in crawl space and did maintenance/service ( no tech has done that in years), maintenance on the side of the house, 3 month old modem needs to be replaced, makes calls about the line to the house, Comcast not sure where the box to my house is out in the street, will have to call another company and get new line to the house, he fixed the work that was in the wall shared by the bedroom and living area, plates are now flush against the wall with the holes hid by the wall plates. Have flashing lights on modem, asked tech if that was OK because with all my numerous phone calls to Comcast with service issues the phone techs said all the lights on the modem should be solid not flashing. He said when phone or Internet is working they will flash. Later that night I get a call from Comcast that a new line will come up to my house by June 11th. June 11th I go out to water and my side gate is wide open. Concerned that someone was trying to break in I start looking around and noticed I had a new Comcast box and wire on the side of my house. That gate we don't use because it is broken; once open it can't shut. Took me an hour to jimmy rig it to shut. Called the escalation department at Comcast and explained with everything I had been through, the numerous hours in phone calls, appointments trying to get the service they promised, the service I am paying them and not receiving for years, I would expect a decrease in my monthly bill. They refused and said I would be charged $90 if I broke my contract. I tried to explain
 they never held up their end of the contract. I was not receiving high speed Internet, faulty equipment, many failures of equipment, etc. The past week I asked to talk to supervisors as I did during this call but not one supervisor would talk to me. They just kept repeating they will charge me $90. This morning I called their corporate office at 215-286-1700 and spoke to Mary Louise who appeared very understanding, wanted to make this right, even reported the damage to my walls and gate. I told her my TV box had to be reset again last night. I asked her about the flashing light on the modem because the bottom 3 keep flashing and she stated ""No that is not suppose to be happening."" She said another representative will be following up with this to be sure it is worked out to my satisfaction according to all I have been through the last few years. But, this afternoon I get the call from the person ( Barbara) who is supposed to make this all right. From her demeanor that was not the case. She did not seem that a reduction in my monthly bill would be an option. There is no way telling why I am experiencing all these issues, that I am in a contract with them, but she did say that a managing technician will be coming to my house on the 16th to see if everything is in working order. She said I got a $50 credit. I do not feel that comes close to compensating me for all that is listed here.

1807,"On 6/10/2015, I ordered Blast speed internet and TV bundle service (Starter XF Double Play with 150MPBS speed) by calling Comcast sale customer service. Comcast sale customer service promised me that they will match the price list on Comcast Website. The website stated that for $74.99 monthly subscription for new customer with 24 months contract, they would give a $75 gift card upon signing up. After 12 months, my monthly subscription will go up to $89.99 a month. This sounded so good, so I signed up. I just found out today that what Comcast customer service promise is not what they list on their website. Instead of the above advertised promotion, I WON'T get the $75 gift card, plus at the end of the 12 months, my price will be $89.99 plus additional $12 a month for blast speed internet service. This brings to a $101.99 a month instead of $89.99 a month as promise. Right now I am stuck with them for 24 months because I signed a contract above. I will be penalize $10/a month for up to 24 months if I cancel with them. I called Comcast many times and spent 2 hours talking to them and they indicated there is nothing they can do.
 I am very frustrated with this misleading false advertising sale practice. I hope that the FCC take this complaint to Comcast executive so they don't do this to other customers.

1809,"I ordered a bundle from Comcast last week (TV+Internet+Phone + their new X1 service with no installation or upgrade fee) for $120 without the intention of using the phone line. The person I talked to said I could keep my currently owned modem and router and they would send a tech to replace my old cable box with the new, at no charge. Today (6/24/2015) the date they said they would send someone out to replace it they changed their entire stance. The tech had to call a Comcast rep and proceeded to tell me that they do need to replace my router and modem with theirs to use the phone line which I was told I didn't have to use. Now they said the only way to use the new X1 box and not use the phone line was to change to a double play package for $109 a month. I thought ""great I am getting the price down to even less"" works for me! That was not the case. After the tech had left I went to talk to another Comcast representative who said the price the other rep gave me was only for tv and that my actual bill with internet is $154 including a $70 installation fee for the new cable box. Per the original agreement installation was supposed to be free. I was able to get the representative to waive the installation fee, which was the right thing to do per original agreement but am not stuck with a bill that is $35 higher than we first agreed on. I got three different prices over the last 7 days and am afraid there will be other random fees that will show up now. I do not appreciate all of the price changes and being taken advantage of and would normally not complain to a government body but since there are no competing services that offer anything near the speeds that Comcast offers I am stuck, thanks to Comcast + government deals. If you could please look into this complaint and urge Comcast to be more transparent in their fees and billing it would be appreciated. I did save 20-30 dollars a month doing this but thought it would be much more and assumed it would be much more since I agreed to two more years of service with them with ETF fees. If a new better service comes a long I will have to pay more money to Comcast with a service I have no other choice but to use at a price that was not originally agreed upon.

There are many other internet providers that allow the use of HBO GO on the Playstation 4, but Comcast seems to be the only one that has voluntarily not allowed the service. Comcast should not have the ability to do something like this, especially for a service that I am paying for.

1812,"My boyfriend and I both live in Atlanta, GA and work as Computer Programmers. We use the internet
 often in order to do our jobs. At our residence, Comcast and ATT are the only internet providers. The
 ATT connection can only go up to 6 mbps and that is minuscule compared to Comcast's speed. In
 reality, we're forced into engaging with a monopoly. Because of our work lives, there is no way we
 can feasibly stay under the arbitrary 300gb cap. The internet is a utility and should be regulated as
 such. The current, broken situation is harmful to consumers who need the internet just as much as

1814,"Comcast refused to cancel my phone service which it guarantees to cancel within 30 days of installation or money back. I ought not to pay for a service that I am not able to cancel. Comcast not only ignores my request for cancellation but the company added a new line of business and increased my monthly bill without my consent.
 On June 17, 2015 I telephoned Comcast and requested to revert services from internet and phone to what I had two weeks prior which was video and internet service. The reversion was based on the 30-day money back guarantee which stated that everything will be as though no change was made including reversion to original price.
 A week after the request, I removed the Comcast modem, switched to my own modem, and got no internet service. I contacted Comcast and was informed that a pending phone disconnect order was blocking use of my own modem. Again I repeated my request to have the phone removed. After some wait, I was asked to replace my modem with the Comcast modem. I did so and got internet access. I was compelled to give further time for the pending disconnect request to process.
 June 25th there was no internet access with the Comcast modem. I again contacted Comcast. While on the phone I asked to switch to my modem and they agreed. They could not get me internet access. They explained that the Comcast phone services on the account necessitated use of the Comcast modem. I was surprised that since I made the cancellation request on the 17th that the phone was still on my account. I removed my modem and plugged in the Comcast modem. The technician did some troubleshooting and when I still had no internet access he cold transferred me to Customer Solutions.
 After once again going through the verification process of providing all the information this next agent required from me, the agent reviewed my account and offered me a $99 Triple Play (phone, internet and video services) which I declined. I reminded her my purpose to get internet access and to see that the phone service is canceled. Further, that the Comcast video equipment remains in an unopened box in my living room. It would not make sense to add more services which I don’t use. Her disapproving tone and continued sales pitch was unexpected. I was forced to repeat a few more times that I have no need of a Triple Play bundle and that I had called to revert back to my original Double Play of Internet and video only. Next thing I was cold transferred to the Activation Dept.
 As in the previous departments, I went through the verification process. The Activation agent got my phone working. I thanked her and asked to speak with a supervisor so I could get a final resolution to the request to cancel the phone. After some wait, I was informed that a supervisor was not available.
 The call ended. That same morning of June 25th, I received a confirmation invoice from Comcast. The invoice showed that a Triple play bundle was added to my account along with increased price.
 My normal monthly bill is $69 ($54 for the basic Double Play and $10 for the Comcast modem and fees). The confirmation invoice shows an increase to $135.29 after a one-month discount of $40. The next bill therefore is expected to be $175. The information also does not reflect the offer which I declined. I had declined a $99 Triple play.
 Comcast forces its service on me. I ought not to pay for a service that I am not able to cancel. Comcast not only ignores my request for cancellation but the company added a new line of business and increased my monthly bill without my consent.

1815,"I have been paying for over a year for High Speed Internet and I have not received the speed of 120 which the technical support said I should have I asked for a refund on 4/2/15 because my speed was pretty low PING 16 Download speed 35.27 and upload 12.16. The representative said he will give me a $120 refund and $6.00 for equipment that I was charged that I did not have. I have not seen my refund so I called today and talked to several supervisor who said they will not give me the refund the representative that I spoke with on 4/2/15 said. One supervisor said he will give me a boost instead of the refund for free for 2 years. He transferred me to technical support. The technician said they do not have the boost available in my area and that it was free I should have not gotten charged for. I was back on the phone with billing supervisor. He said I was getting the boost for free I told him the boost was not available in my area and he assured me it is. I have been getting different stories from the different people I talked to. The bottom line I have been paying for High Speed Internet and never had the speed I was paying for. I am sure there are many customers that are having the same problem I am we are being charge for services we are not receiving and they refuse to give us a refund and offer us the boost for free when in reality like I told the last supervisor Alex SAAN0314 and his supervisor Charlie. I can get it for free on paper but in reality we are not getting the speed we are paying for. My complaint is speed and charges for services not rendered.

 They were not able to solve my complaint what the person said was he was going to cancel my services so he can close the case. I told them if they were not able to fix it I would try to find somebody else. They are rude and unwilling to work with me. They send one technician that was here for less than a couple of minutes and he left without fixing it. They were scheduled the following week and did not showed up. Apparently they found an excuse that I was out of town when that is not what I said. I am very dissatisfied with their business practices. They think they can do whatever they
 want with the customers. They refused to give me a refund for services not rendered. At the present time my phone line is not working and it all started when I spoke with the executive manager that called me and wanted to cancel my services to get me off their face.
 I feel they think they can get away with it.
 What is the next step if they refused to help me.?

1819,"I have an internet service only from comcast as a promotion, this month the promo will end and the only other options I have to either continue my internet subscription with a very high price tag, or combine it with cable and end up paying a slightly lower price that the ""very high price tag"". I was advised by the agent who first gave me this promo a year ago to call a month in advance of the end of the promo and ask about new promos to enroll into.
 It seems to me that Comcast inflate these prices on purpose and count on people forgetting to check on promos again before the year ends.
 We have very limited options for internet in the area and I rely on it for my work.

1823,"I have two properties, one in Santa Cruz and one in Los Gatos.
 In Los Gatos I pay $60/mo for 150mbps internet for my promotional price in Santa Cruz I pay $53 for 25mbps. When the promotion is up i will be back up to over $60.
 Comcast has the backbone in place for faster internet service but due to a lack of competition can charge $60+/mo for 25mbps while just 30 miles away they charge $60 for may times faster service.
 They claim that Santa Cruz isn't DOCIS 3.0 ready but the infrastructure is in place and they choose to not offer any better speeds at better prices because they have a total monopoly.
 Even thought $60/mo is ridiculously high for 25mbps they are the only company offering anything close to the speed price here where i live.
 If there were any other comparable options, I and everyone else would take it.
 It is only because we have no options does Comcast prosper.
 Break them up or regulate the price per mbps and let all ISP's fight on the same footing.
 3mbps from DSL, Sat, Cable should have a fixed MAXIMUM price, if they want to undercut each-other great.

 The complaint should not be closed because the same issue is ongoing. Please see email thread between Christina (Comcast) and myself.
 For the past year, that I have had service here, Comcast keeps saying the speed increase is coming any day. It has yet to appear yet prices have remained high.
 150mbps 15mi away costs $60, 30mbps here costs $60… I’m not advocating a $12/mo bill, which it would be if prices scaled according to speed. The next fastest provider in my area is DSL at 6mbps which is a joke if you need to work from home. So long as Comcast offers a substantial speed bump over others, even if unfairly priced, virtually have no choice but to use Comcast. This pricing practice is at the very heart of the Title II FCC reclassification.
 I am required by my work to have a faster internet connection but their regional monopoly (aka a cartel) doesn’t have any incentive to increase speeds or reduce prices to reflect the service provided. In fact, they are happy to promise faster speeds than they can deliver and charge you for them.
 Thanks you,
 Hi Christina,
 The tech came out today and helped clean up the wiring. He replaced some plugs and was very helpful, he said it needed to be done anyways.
 On the down side is that he also told me that the upgraded speed is not in our area yet.
 He said it was supposed to happen a month or so ago, but was pushed by corporate and is now 10 weeks out still.
 Ever other time I have inquired about the speed bump I get the same answer… “Any week now, all they have to do is flip the switch.”
 DOCSIS 3 is already in our area and all the channels necessary to increase speeds are present but there is a conscious decision to keep speeds low and prices high.
 This type of price gouging issue is representative of regional monopoly (a.k.a. a cartel). I know you can’t control any of this nor can Comcast force a competitor into this market space but honest business practices would be to align pricing based on speed and not some price/speed/competitors
 (b)

 pricing algorithm. I’m sure some data analyst has determined what the maximum someone is willing to pay for the “fastest” speed in their area.
 150mbps 15mi away costs $60, 30mbps here costs $60… I’m not advocating a $12/mo bill, which it would be if prices scaled according to speed. The next fastest provider in my area is DSL at 6mbps which is a joke if you need to work from home. So long as Comcast offers a substantial speed bump over others, even if unfairly priced, virtually have no choice but to use Comcast. This pricing practice is at the very heart of the Title II FCC reclassification.
 Is there anything you can do make our drastically slower speeds here in Santa Cruz more price appropriate while keeping me at the 2nd to top speed tier. I believe that you can get 50 in our area, but I’m only getting 30 and when/if the speed goes up it will go to 50mbps and 150mbps.
 When and IF 150mbps comes out then I may look to go down that road, but I don’t really want to keep paying $5/mo for the speed bump when there is no guarantee about when it will actually happen.
 I know you must be frustrated at these types of corporate shenanigans as much as the techs who have to deal with the complains and the sales people who are told to sell a product that they can’t provide.
 I appreciate your efforts in helping us find a happier medium
 Regards,
 I am looking in to it now

1829,"1. My internet was down so I called Comcast. My account at that time was ""Economy Plus"" for $54.03 per month.
 2. After getting internet back up the rep told me I can increase my speed (double it, actually) for $7 per month. NO OTHER fees were mentioned, so I added $54.03 + $7.00 and expected a monthly fee of $61.03.
 3. I fell for it and said yes.
 4. I just noticed that on March 24, Comcast took $140.81 out of my checking account!
 5. They also sent me an e-mail stating that my monthly fee is now $85.04 and they’ll be removing that amount from my bank account at the end of this month. ( I am signed up for auto-withdrawal)
 6. I checked details of my bill on line. These are the fees that I was NEVER told about: (1) $10 monthly rent of new modem (2) $10 monthly rent of new router (3) $70 installation fee when one of their employees set this up (4) High Speed Blast internet is billed at $12, not $7 (5) Xfinity ""Voice Unlimited"" for $44.95, discounted to $19.99 because this is a ""bundle. "" (You can say that again!)
 7. I called their 1-800 service number. The young girl, Eva, was nice, but clueless. She basically said there is nothing she could do, so if I want to go back to my original $54.03 service, I should take the new router to the local office and take care of it there in order to avoid ANOTHER $70 fee to have someone come to my house and disconnect my new service, router, modem, etc.
 After all of this, I have lost $192.80 to Comcast's unethical ""service"" of not notifying me of any additional costs beyond the $7.00. (10 + 10+ 12+ 19.99+ 140.81)
 Can you please (!) help me get back my money and can you stop Comcast from lying to other customers? I'm a teacher on the verge of retirement; I can't afford what these sleazes have done to me.
 Thank you very much for any assistance you can offer.

1830,"I have continuously called this company to start up a new service for Internet and television. They told me it was available on my street and sent a technician out to my house to install service. It was very disappointing that the installer said he could not install the service because the cable line did not run to my house, it was about 500 feet away. To me this is very wrong and I feel like it was completely false advertisement. I chose to go with Comcast because I love their Internet and TV but for some reason every time I try and call to speak to a supervisor or try and speak to someone about why they cannot install nobody can do anything to get me to the right place. I really think this company needs to be looked into. I will unfortunately be taking more steps in the near future to make sure this company understands it cannot do what it has been doing for years.

On 6/22/15 the rep on the phone at Comcast Business Class offered me a limited time deal of $79.95 and NO TV service, which I explained I did not have with the previous $59 deal. He said I would only pay $79.95 for internet and not for TV. Bill came today with TV charged - $20 plus many TV fees. I twice phoned to protest, was changed to the Loyalty Department each time, and each time they would not honor what the sales person sold me. They said they could send me a form to say I wanted the TV service removed, but then the internet portion would go up to 109.95. The stories of the two people were consistent, but in contradiction to the commitment of the sales person on 6/22/15. I feel this was a blatant bait and switch violation. I deserve to have what was promised to me. My account number is , in the name of New Mexico Pain Management, LLC.

1834,"When I was first moving to my new home in Santa Fe, TX (77510) Comcast promised me service at my new address. When the technician got there, he hooked up to our cable and said he couldn't get a reading, and had to call a lineman. Now, they say my address is ""unserviceable."" After many, many phone calls, emails, and visits with my neighbors, I've come to find out that I have MULTIPLE neighbors with service, one of which is less than 500 feet away from my property. I have found at least 5 that outline my block and have full service. Also, near my street, there is a telecom wire that's broken and looked like it was lying on the ground, but someone picked it up and tied it back to the guide wire. I know the telecom wires do not carry a charge on them, but it seems dangerous that this wire is allowed to hang around where kids can reach it. Also, there is one of those green boxes with telecom stuff in it, open, with exposed wires hanging in a ditch. I mean, I can see not wanting to hook up one customer, but it seems absurd that every block around me can get cable, while I can't. And the reason I can't, is because they want to leave wires exposed everywhere where little children can be playing with them. Who knows, lightning might strike it and charge those lines up. The Texas PUC says that the FCC handles complaints, so I just need this resolved, the wires fixed, and cable internet again. The worst part is I cannot get a hold of anyone there that can give me an answer, they just keep brushing me off. If needed I can provide the addresses of my direct neighbors that have service, adjacent to my property. Also, Before hurricane Ike, there was service here. This property belonged to my father-in-law, and he had internet and cable TV through Comcast.

1838,"I have had many issues with Comcast for adding charges to my bill. I was told that if I pay the bill on the 24th of every month I could 1. carry a 2 month balance because I don't want to pay for my services in advance before I get them. 2. there would be no disruption of service if I did it this way. My bill is supposed to be $45 per month but on any given time that I have called, I have been given differing amounts with remarks about before taxes and after taxes. Last month my bill was $60 and I called customer service and they said no it isn't! I was looking right at it. Of course, I paid the amount that it is supposed to be and customer service said they were making the changes on my bill to correct it. I honestly don't think this was done. This month I went to pay the bill on the 22nd of the month and I got a service interruption notice stating that I owed them $150. I called customer service and when asked for a breakdown, as usual no one can figure it out. Today 6/24/15 I called again and got someone who was completely clueless about anything to do with Comcast and he works there. I thought the chat guys were bad, but this guy was worse. Comcast seems to hire inexperienced people in third world countries and they are unable to assist. I don't use my internet service very often. I have thought about automatic payments, but am not convinced since Comcast adds amounts to my bill without informing me and who knows how much they would increase the bill with an option for automatic payments. This has happened to me so often and I feel like I have to struggle for my consumer rights every month with this company. I need someone from the company to call me who is knowledgeable.

Got a call from someone by the name of Jacob (not sure if that was really his name) when I asked for his last he wouldn't give it. He said what? are you gonna complain? I've got a work order to turn off your service. You're the person who didn't pay their bill. I'm in front of your house right now and I don't see a welcome mat out, so I didn't know if you still live here. I told him I have been trying to
 work out a resolution with comcast and to leave the service on. He said if you want it on you pay me $91.00 right now. This is over the phone, how do I know this person? I certainly am not paying him anything over the phone. I haven't had a chance to speak to customer service. His phone number is 941-882-0446. I am astounded that Comcast sends people over to strong arm their customers into paying their bills. What kind of a so called employee calls someone up and is completely disrespectful. I'm sure ""Jacob"" can't keep a job anywhere else because of his lack of a personality and his anger issues. I would like to escalate my complaint to someone besides customer service. Although they were prompt from what I can see, I was not able to return the call since my phone was lost. If I had access to my internet, I could have responded, but I didn't until today when I returned to my office.

I recently purchased a PS4 game console, and single game downloads can reach 50GB in size, and mandatory updates for already owned games commonly reach 5-10 GB size. My wife likes to watch shows on Netflix, and these can run 2GB/hour of streaming.
 We are constantly having to check our usage to make sure we are not running over our allotted 300GB limit. Our monthly service charge is $30/month for internet usage, making a 10 GB/dollar ratio. Their overage charge is $10 for 50GB of data, making a 5GB/dollar ratio, which just seems like they are taking advantage of customers who use more data than alloted.
 If data allowances cannot be overcome, there must be a more sensible solution than this. This is causing my family stress as we shouldn't have to worry about how much data we are using as two full time workers who only get to use Internet capable devices for only a few hours a day.

1841,"Comcast called me and left a message to inform me they needed to disconnect service at my address in order to provision a new customer. I called back and was told to ignore that call, that it was a misdirected call and my service would NOT be disconnected. Later that day, April 2nd, my service was in fact disconnected.
 The address is a multi-family dwelling with 40 lots. Obviously they disco'd the wrong address.
 7 calls later (and 5 disconnected calls with no call-back) I finally got the service restored - after 2 hours of phone time with Comcast personnel.
 Each call required me to repeat my story to each agent, then to each supervisor after a required escalation.
 The whole provisioning process seems broken. I'm really frustrated with the inept customer service and the multiple hand-offs, having to repeat the background each time I was disconnected,
 I am very disappointed that an existing customer's service can be disconnected without verifying directly with the customer. This was simply sloppy work, followed by very poor customer service.
 This mistake cost the Comcast company a lot of time in multiple call centers. and cost me, the customer, 2 hours of my personal time, 7 phone calls, and an unacceptable amount of ""rework"" in repeating the problem over and over to each new representative.
 Being a process engineer, I experienced inconsistent process, inconsistent solutions to the problem, depending on which agent I spoke with, and broken process (leaks) that allowed a customer to be accidentally disconnected. A costly mistake that required a lot of rework, frustration, and a very poor customer experience.
 One of my worst experiences in over 25 years of IT and customer service experience.

I would have to explain the whole scenario over again, in which they would do the same play as the last person.
 This was resolved with the BBB later that month.
 The next issue came on February 28th, 2015. Our bill stated that we had missed a payment, which was true. I called and explained to the person that I had received neither an email, post mail, or even telephone call about that bill. There was no warning to pay it. I looked through all my emails of which I never delete and could not find a bill from Comcast.
 This representative told me that they would look in to it and refund me for being charged a late fee since the Bill did not come.
 Today, it is April 25th. I have not yet received compensation for the total charged from me several months ago.
 We also live in an apartment in which cable is provided by the complex. The complex and the Comcast representative (Stacy, responsible for the MAA apartments in Savannah, GA) told us that if the wiring in the wall was faulty, it was Comcast's responsibility. She claimed that as long as we had not tampered with the outside of the wiring, Comcast would take our account number but not charge us for the visit (they would charge the apartment complex).
 Of course, this was not the case because when the bill arrived, it charged us for the visit. The billing manager Anthony claimed that what she told us was false and that Comcast is not responsible for the wiring in our complex. The bill would be charged to us and the apartment could compensate us afterwards.

1844,"I've been a loyal Comcast customer for over 2 years in Georgia (longer in other states). I have 2
 accounts with them. Each account is for different residents. In March, 2015, I needed to switch one of
 those account's to a new residence. (Due to selling 1 home.) I spoke with a rep to have service
 switched from the sold home to a new residence. This is all for a second residence. Not my primary
 residence. My primary residence is to remain the same. This entire process was never to involve my
 primary residence.
 As I spoke with the rep to switch service from my second residence. (which was sold.) To a new
 residence which will still be a second residence. Again, not to affect or regarding my primary
 residence. She asked for the new address for the new second residence. I complied and she began
 to offer me promotions since I would now add cable to this new second residence. Previously we had
 satellite at the old second residence for television. (Which I wish we still were able to have.)
 The rep for Comcast gave me different promotion options. Since I was a loyal customer she said
 Comcast would waive the install fee. After going over the options with her. I settled on an option that
 would keep my current internet and add TV. My internet speed was to stay the same. The price was
 also to remain the same. I was given a price of $39.99/month for internet plus $9.99 modem/wifi
 router rental for 12 months. (Total price $49.98/month for 12 months.) For TV, she offered a promo of
 $62.00/month for 12 months. This was to include a cable dvr box with HD for 1 room. She said she
 was creating the ticket or order for this promotion.
 She asked if I needed a tech to come install the items or would I be installing. We discussed details
 about this. I decided to do the install myself. She then said she would still send a tech out at no
 charge to verify service was on and active at this residence. It was to be free of charge. She provided
 me with a location near me to pick up the cable dvr box for TV. We already had a modem and wifi box
 we used at the previous address for rental. I then asked her, ""will I be able to use this box at the new
 address without issue?"" She said absolutely and then all I would have to do is call in to tech support
 to give the number on the box if an issue occurred.
 So I went to the location near my second residence to pick up the cable dvr box. When I arrived the
 gentlemen was pleasant and nice. I gave my name and he looked me up in the system. He was able
 to locate me but the order was different in his system from what the rep over the phone told me. He
 said this was typical. Phone Reps will often make issues regarding orders with customers. I asked
 what he had for me in the system. He said he had me down for a cable box without dvr and HD. That
 DVR and HD would be more. I told him my total price for TV and internet was suppose to be $112 a
 month for 12 months. He said he did not see that. It was actually more. I became very upset. I told
 him I literally just got off the phone with your rep about 10-15 minutes prior to arrival. I told him the
 promotion offers she promised. He said unfortunately he wouldn't be able to offer that. He told me to
 call them back and see if they can update it. I said,""Ok. I will."" I asked if I would be able to take the
 current box and switch it out later? He told me yes. So I accepted what he had now. The Comcast
 tech wasn't due to come out to the home until the next day to verify service.
 The next day the tech never showed so I called. This time I spoke to a different rep and she said she
 had no record of the new address or service. I said this is impossible. I went to the store yesterday
 and he had me in the system but the order was incorrect. Also, I have a cable box, how was I able to
 receive one with no service requested or ordered? She said she didn't know but there was no record
 for the address I provided. So I said would they have mixed tit up with my primary address even
 though I never gave that address on the phone. She said they shouldn't have.
 I then said maybe it is under the old residence address for my second home which we just sold. She
 checked and found it under that address. I said that is weird because we left that address. We are at
 a new residence for my second residence. She apologized for the error and said she will make the
 correction and send a tech out tomorrow. I told her thank you. I was having issues installing the cable
 and internet and this must be why because the tech never came out and also there was no record to
 turn on service. She said that I was correct. She said previous occupants had comcast so it should
 not be an issue to have this turned on.
 Day 2 we waited all day for the tech to come out. Again, the tech never showed so I called and they
 said he was to be on the way but was running behind. So I waited again. He never showed up and it
 was around 8pm. So I waited another day and no tech. 2 days now without any tv or internet. Yet I
 was still billed for such. I called that evening and explained what happened and asked to speak with a
 manager or supervisor in charge. I was told all supervisors and managers were tied up for the
 evening and someone would call me within an hour. I was told they would have one call me as soon
 as available. I waited and received no call. So I called back and explained the situation again and
 asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. I was then told that all supervisors and managers went
 home for the day and someone would call tomorrow.
 I then asked to be transferred to technical support to see if I would be able to install at least internet.
 She said service would need to be turned on first. I said ok. So the next day I still received no call
 from a supervisor or manager. So I called around 3pm that day. I spoke with a new rep and told them
 my issue. I asked to speak with a supervisor or manager. They said they would have one call me by
 7pm. No tech made it be known he came so I was still unsure if one arrived. I called back and spoke
 to technical support to see if I could get TV and Internet turned on. I was able to get the tv to work
 and internet. 9pm arrived with no call from a supervisor or manager. I called again to try and atleast
 correct the bill amount and get the DVR with HD I was promised for the price I was promised only to
 be denied. It would cost $40 more a month I was told. I said this is ridiculous. I want what was
 promised to me from the beginning. She apologized and said she would have a supervisor or
 manager call me once one was in tomorrow. So after 3 days of no service I was finally able to get tv
 and internet service but not at the price promised and not with the equipment promised.
 We received a bill for a prorated amount for the old second residence, the new second residence and
 our primary residence. So we paid the amount. We used the phone option and paid the balance in
 full. On May 23rd, 2015 we received a bill of notice to turn off service due to no payment. I have bank
 account records of payment, confirmation numbers of billing payment and spoke with reps yet still this
 hasn't been resolved as of today. I'm extremely unhappy with my service from Comcast. After paying
 3 bills which I believe was incorrect any. I still paid them all and now have to deal with the issue of
 calling and speaking with several reps to get this resolved. I have dealt with all these issues and still
 do not have the television and internet price and service I was promised."
1845,"Consumer is calling about Comcast cable. A tree fell in her yard on 5/16/15 and knocked out her lines
 including cable. She contacted Comcast and explained her situation was different than others in her
 area. Comcast set up an appointment on 5/19/15 and 5/20/15 from 8AM to 8PM no one called and no
 one showed. She called Comcast and they kept saying someone would show and no did. She was
 rescheduled again for 5/26/15 again no one showed or called. Currently she has an appointment for
 5/28/15. One rep said they would give her a $20.00 credit for the missed appointment. Consumer
 wants her services restored immediately. She also feels she should receive at least a month free of
 service for all of her inconveniences. CTR252"
1846,"I've been a loyal customer with Comcast for over 2 years in Savannah, Georgia. I have service with them at 2 of my residences. At my primary residence I have had internet for 2 years. (I have satellite for tv.) This residence was not to change.
 We sold our second home and was transferring internet from our second home to a new second residence. We we're transferring internet and adding television to this new second residence. This is when all the issues began.
 Spoke to a customer service rep to transfer existing internet. They explained the pricing and that the rate would continue. We attempted to get satellite at this residence for tv. It was not available. So I called to speak to Comcast about adding a tv service with them.
 I spoke with a different rep than the first time. This rep explained to me promotions that included internet. Also, asked me what channels I was looking to have for tv. We discussed the pricing and terms for tv and internet. I selected a package. We were told we could use all the previous equipment for internet at our old second residence at the new second residence. She said internet will be an easy self install. She verified that the previous tenants at our new second residence had previous had comcast service. So all she had to do was activate the address. She explained she would send a tech out the next day just incase an issue arose.
 Everything sounded great. We then continued to speak. We then spoke about tv. She said we have an option to receive items in the mail or she could refer us to a location near us for pick up. I explained I would rather do the pick up option so I could do self install tonight rather than wait. She gave the address and stated that if any issues arose a tech would be by tomorrow to make sure everything went ok. I confirmed pricing with her and what I would be picking up from the Comcast location near us.
 We went to the location on Victory Drive. Which was a new store front. We spoke to the gentlemen at the counter and explained what we were picking up. He looked up my name in the system and only saw I had internet. I asked if he was checking the correct residence because I have 2 homes. He then checked again and said that both residences had internet. I explained to him I had literally got off the phone with a rep about 10-15 minutes ago.
 He said he could go ahead and add tv to my account. I said please do. i just want to receive what I was promised. He said not a problem. He asked me what I was looking to get as far as package and channels. I told him I was suppose to get a dvr and explained the channels I wanted. He explained the fees for dvr rental and monthly rate for both internet and tv. I told him no. That was not the correct
 pricing I was given over the phone. He asked what I was told over the phone. I explained I was to get tv w/ dvr and internet for $119/ month before tax. This included the dvr, dvr rental fees, channels w/ hd which she said was free, internet with modem/router combo and modem/router rental fees. He said he could not honor that and I would have to contact whomever I spoke with regarding the pricing. I said ok. I explained to him. I just wanted to watch tv tonight and he was to give me a cable box and remote for now. He said I could come back and pickup a dvr later once I spoke to the rep. They didn't have any dvr's in store at the moment anyhow.
 So I went home and attempted to install internet and tv. I followed the instructions on the box. Internet and Tv did not work. I called a rep and spoke to them on the phone. they walked me through the steps and couldn't figure out the issue. They said a tech will be out tomorrow to work on it. So I gave up on it that night and waited for tomorrow.
 The tech never showed. I called 3 times that day to verify and they said he was coming. Again he never showed that day. So I called and explained to someone the issue. They then transferred me to tech support. The tech said we would need to get a new internet box and that the box we currently have we couldn't use at the new residence. I asked why no one had told me this after i spoke to at least 7 different reps. He said he didn't know.
 So we waited for the new modem/router to arrive. It didn't arrive for a few days. It arrived a day and a half later. So 3 days into service at the new address we still had none. I attempted self install again with no success. I called and spoke to tech support. He was able to get the internet working. I asked him about the tv issue. He helped resolve it as well. After 3 days with no actual tech coming to our home. We we're helped over the phone.
 I called again regarding the tv dvr and pricing. I spoke to 3 different reps who quoted me different pricing. Finally I became frustrated and asked to speak to a supervisor. Ever time I did a rep asked me why. I explained I just wanted to be quoted 1 price and I was given 3 different prices. I just want what I was promised. Each time a rep told me a supervisor would call. I continued to call and every time a rep asked me the same question and told me the same thing. After 2 months of no response. I received a bill in the mail for a past due amount. I was upset. I called and asked to speak to a supervisor. Again, I was given the run around. Finally, I had a friend who was a regional manager at Comcast and asked him to please help. He had a store manager locally call me to help. She went over the bill with me and was very kind. She attempted to resolve the issue as best as she could she explained. She then eliminated some of the fees, over charges and late fees, and we agreed on a price. She said it may take a day or 2 to update. I was suppose to receive a credit that was to be applied to my second residence. It wasn't. My bill wasnt fixed or changed. I'm so disappointed in how this process was handled and controlled. I then wrote a letter of complaint with the FCC. Which then the next day a person from corporate then contacted me while at work. I told her that was amazing that I would be contacted after filing a FCC complaint but no one took the issue serious enough prior to resolve this after 2 months.
 She apologized. I explained to her I was at work until 7 and to give me a call later that evening when I get off at 7pm est. She never did but did call around 8:30pm est. No voicemail was left and the number that appeared on my caller ID wasn't valid to use. I say this because I called it twice and it stated a message but you could not leave a voicemail or get ahold of anyone. I tried this number for 4 days with no success. Comcast will be losing my business for both addresses. After 2 months of stress and headache. After just wanting to speak to one person who could answer my questions and
 fix the issues with my account. It is not complex to do as you promise. They try to ware you down to give in and just accept pay for things you were wrongly charged. I could go on and on but I will stop here. I will however continue to file a complaint until they resolve the issues.

1848,"I signed up for a service including 105 mbps speeds on June 2, 2015. The customer service rep repeatedly confimed, verbally, I would be receiving download speeds of up to 105 mbps for 49.95 per month. After a week of slow internet, we tested it and saw our speeds had been capped around 60 mbps and called Comcast. We were told by a service rep over the phone we were indeed supposed to get 105mbps and sent a technician for service. Upon the technician's arrival on June 17, 2015 we were informed our service was not tiered for the promised 105 mbps and we had to go back to Comcast to change it and pay more for the forementioned promised services. As we returned to the physical location and spoke with the SAME customer rep in person, she agreed our plan should be getting 105 mbps, according to her computer, but said there was nothing they could do about the cap unless we paid for the extreme 105 (89.99/month). The backwards logic and run around from the associate, Natalie, at the Comcast office in Savannah, GA, moved us to purchase the extreme 105. While we were still in our original 30 days trial and new member pricing (12 months period), we were charged full member pricing for the upgraded services and offered a $10 discount for 6 months (through December 2015) and not the promised promo we deserved and have been doubly, wrongly signed up for this month. As I was showing the service rep on my phone, attached, I had the new member discount for the 105 at the 54.99 price. After a phone call today, June 25, I was told there were no such services in the united states (a lie) and I had to pay the full price 89.99/99.99. When I went online to check, there is indeed an option for internet/tv services within my ORIGINAL price range for 75 mbps and still would have had the cap at 55 whether I paid for this one or not. Because Comcast has not identified itself with its wrongdoing and will not pricematch ( I was offered a one time discount for grievances and a $5 monthly reduction off 89.99 for 6 months) I am formerly writing this complaint. They verbally and knowingly misinformed me of my speeds to force me into a higher payment plan monthly and wasted about 7 hours of my time between phone calls, holding on the phone, and physical visits to the store. Please keep in mind these plans did include some TV and at other times did not, as it should be notified by Comcast in my bill.

I was just informed by my coworker that they offer a plan that was not a special promotion that offered 50Mbps internet service, HBO, and local channels for 59.99 a month. I called customer service to have my service switched to the later this evening. After a friendly 3 minute exchange with the representative I was told he had found the plan I requested and was pulling it up. He then asked to put me on a brief hold. After 20 minutes I was greeted by a different representative that had no idea why I was calling or how long I had been waiting. I told her that I wanted to change my plan in order to lower my bill. After going through the process of verifying my identity, she then started asking me if my modem was plugged in and to describe the problem I was having with my internet connection. Needless to say, I did not continue the call, as I have data limits on my cell phone plan as well as my internet usage and Comcast has no interest in paying my Verizon bill. I spent 29 minutes and 21 seconds on the phone with Comcast and was no closer to changing my billing plan than I was before I picked up the phone.

1852,"The bill I receive from Comcast appears intentionally confusing. There are many items listed under ""Additional XFINITY TV Services"" that have no explanation. Most are listed as a charge and then a subsequent credit for the amount of the charge. Are these promotional items? While I be charged for these services at some point? Did I even sign up for these additional services?
 I know my HBO additional service is a promotional rate but I don't know when it will run out. The date for when it expires is no where on the bill or the plan agreement. The only way I could find out was to wait for nearly an hour to chat with a representative at Comcast.
 This practice of listing all of these services that you don't actually pay for (as they are credited back) among services you do pay for appears deceptive. Obviously by listing all of these charges and credits it would be easy to miss an incorrect charge.
 The bill should list the promotional items and when the promotional rate expires. The bill should not list these other services which I assume are just included. If they are free services and not promotional items then they should list the charge as zero. The shouldn't list a charge and then a credit.
 I have included a copy of one of my bills. Hopefully my explanation is clear enough to see the nature of my complaint.

1856,"Set the move date of my business around the data relocation which drives our phones and network. Had the install date scheduled for a few weeks. Today came and our comcast rep showed up and let me know that the cable run from the buildings telco room is to far to reach our server room. He let me know that a ticket had to be submitted for the construction group to come out and survey and install a run so he could start and finish the installation. This rep fully admitted that a survey should have been scheduled internally within comcast. He said they made an assumption that because the building had service that everything was setup. Tech left the office and didn’t offer any insight. We reached out to our sales consultant who gave vague responses via email only (wouldn’t return our phone calls) and left at the end of the day without providing any expectations or solutions. I called the supervisor who never returned my phone call. Called various other departments and supervisors and was hung up on or transferred around. I have been working on this issue the entire day and am completely frustrated that I have gotten nowhere. Not an ounce closer to understanding what the next steps are.
 My business is at a standstill without email, phones or internet all because a simple survey wasn’t scheduled weeks ago. What I find more appalling is no one will take the responsibility to pick up the phone and discuss my options our at the very least, when I can expect a resolution.
 PLEASE, we need assistance or we are going to lose business as a result.

1857,"I am being forced into buying a cable subscription from Comcast as part of a bundle in order to get internet service. Trying to just get internet by itself costs me more ($65) than the bundle with cable. I feel that their pricing policy is unfair as they are forcing me to select a service that I do not want by making the alternative significantly more expensive.
 This practice is to artificially force (read: bully) customers into purchasing an unnecessary service and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.

1861,"I am a consumer in search for a Internet and TV provider. I had researched promotions and packages available to me on COMCAST/XFINITY’s website. I had discovered a promotional package that I was interested in and attempted to purchase online through their website. I had received an error message after completing the forms and was instructed to contact their sales department by phone. At that time I called and spoke with a sales reperstive for Comcast/Xfinity and discussed the promotional package I had discovered on their website and received a error message while attempting to purchase online. The sales rep then told me the promotion was only available online and if their website did not allow me to complete my order then I can do it over the phone however my promotion would not be available to me over the phone. I then expressed my disappointment that I was deceived into believing this promotion was available to me, however was unattainable due to their website malfunctioning. I was dissasfited with their over the phone promotions and asked to speak with someone who could access the promotion presented online. After speaking with 6 sales associates from different sales departments in a total of 4.5 hours I had finally spoke with a sales associate who stated the original promotion that I was interested in was available and she would be happy to sell me this promotion. I then provided all of my information over the phone and agreed to the terms discussed, which matched the online promotion I discovered. That same day I went to my local Comcast retailer and was able to pick up my equipment. When I reviewed the equipment provided to me in store the equipment was incorrect which I pointed out to the sales associate. She then corrected the equipment order and provided me with the “appropriate” equipment, that was damaged and missing the battery provided with the equipment. She did not correct this issue. I then proceeded home and self installed the equipment provided to me. On the evening of this day I received an email stating my package provided to me which did not reflect the package I agreed to. The internet provided in the package was not the correct speed 105mbs (blast) but 25mbs (performance), which are the titles assigned to their speed rates to only further deceive the consumer. The following day I contacted Comcast regarding the incorrect internet speed rate provided to me not matching the agreed speed of 105mbs. I then again spoke with 3 individual sales associates for a total of 1.5 hours that again stated the original promotion I discovered on their website was not accessible to them in their computer systems and I would be required to upgrade to 105mbs (blast) for $12.00 per month. I then asked to speak with a supervisor who within 30mins was able to correct this issue and changed my agreement to the original promotion in which I inquired about. I politely asked this supervisor why he was able to correct this issue so easily after I spent 5.5 hours in total speaking with multiple sales associates that attempted to deceive me into believing this promotion was incorrect and unavailable when he clearly stated that he was aware of this promotion and apologized for the sales department being unaware this promotion existed.
 I believe this was intentional and an example of deceptive sales practices. If I were not diligent and spent numerous hours speaking with countless Comcast reperstives I would not have received the promotional package clearly defined on their own website. Furthermore I could have been deceived
 into believing I needed to upgrade my package in order to receive the original promotion increasing my monthly charges from $99.99 to more than $150.00 for the same services and package defined on their website.

 I have been trying since Thursday 4-2-15 to get my internet service active, since then I have transferred to various personnel that do not have anything to do with the matter, spoke to Rachael the team leader, when I asked her for her ID she hung up on me. I called numerous times and finally someone was able to identify the issue which is that my payment went to another account. Even after identifying the issue they could not activate my account and even thought the mistake was on Comcast ends they speak to me very rude, especially the team leader Rachael. At this point my service is still not active and I keep getting the run around. I have never had such a miserably experience with customer service, no one knows what to do or how to fix the issue, If there were other options with good internet speeds I would drop them in a heart beat. I am so frustrated dealing with Comcast customer service .

1864,"I would like to make a complaint against Comcast Inc. On 8/24/14we were contacted by Norma Mosede to sell us a promo program "" triple Play "" for $109.99 for the first year and $134.99 for the second year. In the middle of the order form signed by Norma and myself was a number $137.99. I was under the impression that would be the price after the two year agreement was concluded.
 After the first month which , the bill included an additional $29.99 installation charge plus which we paid, $109.99 plus the $29.99 I understood there would be an installation charge. The next month the bill was $142.91and continued for several months. Then the bills started to increase to $150.59.for the last four months.
 I started contacting Norma Mosede after the first month to ask why the increase in the monthly rate of $109.99, which is noted on the service order. She could not explain why , but then came back to me and said all of the other equipment in the house had increased the price and that is why the price increased. I advised that I had her service order that didn't say anything about additional parts to be added to the promo costs. I went next to her supervisor Grace Cooper who advise that I had agreed to this increased price. I asked to see what kind of a contract I signed. She sent me a blank copy of a letter that I had not signed or ever seen. I asked to speak to her supervisor Jeff Hagard. who indicate that I didn't sign anything . He indicated I approved the increase over the phone . I asked for a copy of the recording and was advised I couldn't get it. I did not approve any such contract to allow increases to the service order anytime they wanted to make increases. If I signed a two year agreement for a stated amount it should not change because of equipment that I had before the promo was offered and accepted.
 I then went up to Jeff's supervisor Shawn but never heard from him. Some time during the 10 or 15 calls to all of the above I got Liz?? who said if I would take the service order to the local Comcast store and if they saw and reviewed the service order and it was as I said then they would correct the different monthly bills. I went to the local Comcast store in the Seaford Village in Seaford De. I talked to Sharies Felipe who agreed that there was no reference to additional charges on the service order. She would allow her supervisor to review the service order and get it changed. I went back to the store the next day and was told the supervisor was trying to get in touch with Norma's supervisor She sent the service order to him to make the final decision.
 I then called customer support and I got a similar answer that I had agreed to the additional charges. Again I asked for copy
 of the recording or signed agreement. The customer support person did not think she could get the audio agreement.
 I can send you a copy of the service order signed by Norma and myself if you give me an address. Comcast also has a copy. They also have a copy of the unsigned letter that supposedly came to my house.
 Lastly Jeffery Haggard advised me he thought the $137.86 noted on the service order was supposed to be the monthly price. I advised him we never got a bill with $137.86. all of our bills have been higher. $142.91 or 150.56??
 Please review the agreements. If there are any Comcast agreements signed by me I'd like to see them. Please call me at as soon as possible, if you need any additional information. Thank you.
 . Seaford De. 19973
 I don't know how to add the attachments but I will send them if you would please give an address.

1867,"Hi,
 I'd like to file a complaint about Comcast and pricing. Last year, my TV+internet bill went to 190+ dollars, and Comcast is the only provider in this area. When I called to see if I could take TV off to reduce payments, they told me that I could not without reducing my speed to 3mbps, down from fifty. They instead offered me an 'introductory package' for $20 less, but forced me to include a home-phone service even though I said repeatedly and vehemently stated I did not need the service and have no use for it.
 I am at my wit's end, and all I want is decent internet at a decent price. I live in Seattle and the cost of living here is high enough already. Comcast is the only provider in the area, and I have no other options.

1870,"Agreed upon price: 49.99 (+ taxes, fees), charged 72.50. Not about the amount, but rather the fact I was told one thing and then charged another. I feel disrespected and in a sense, betrayed, even though I would not have put it past them to try this. I submitted a complaint to the FTC regarding this, as there was no notification of a change in pricing, nothing. Just one day it went from approximately $52.00 to $72.00. I paid for internet and public cable to keep the price low at $52.00. After reading how the open internet transparency mandate requires ISP's to disclose pricing details, I decided to bring you into the loop as well. At least if a price that is charged monthly without changing is to change, notify the customer. Send them a letter, email them, call them, exert effort. No effort was exerted and a line was crossed. It's not okay to say you will charge one thing and actually charge another.
 Random issue that popped up when I tried to get a hold of them was their website states that representatives are available 24/7. Which insinuates that a representative from each department is available, which is not true. Just technicians are available. Technicians as in technical support/representatives.

1871,"Two issues, one is we are paying for cable internet service its basic internet service that is suppose to be up to 50mbps, then we are paying an additional fee for a product called ""Blast"" that is suppose to be up to 105mbps.
 Since we have canceled cable tv service we have had noticeable slow downs to the point where we are now having to monitor the speeds. While attempting to watch streaming video on our computer as well as on a streaming device we now have times where it just stalls out, prior to the removal of the cable tv service we never had a problem, now we are seeing our internet speeds drop below the minimum we are paying for, speeds varying between 18mbps - 42mbps. At times it is at or above the minimum of 50mbps, but its consistently dropping below.
 I have contacted Comcast on many occasions now and have not been given any help in trying to remedy the slower speeds, they consistently pass me amongst different departments only to have them sort of throw up there hands with what to do? All this seem very suspicious as it coincides with our removal of cable tv service and it feels like we are having internet service throttled.
 At a minimum its a deceptive practice to charge for a higher speed and not reliably be able to provide it.
 In the Seattle market unfortunately the only high speed internet provider available to us is Comcast the other provider Centrylink can only provide 7mbps. So due to Comcasts monopoly on high speed internet its creating an environment where I believe Comcast has no motivation to provide the service levels that would be expected if they were in a viable competitive market.

1872,"I took a 30 day trial of ComCast's internet service, and I canceled before the trial expired. They tried
 to talk me into staying, of course, but I was very clear that I wanted to cancel. I received phone calls
 from multiple individuals at ComCast, all of whom tried to talk me into remaining a customer. On the
 last call, the individual threatened that I had canceled a day AFTER the 30 day trial had expired,
 which, I informed him, was not true. I only had ComCast internet for a period of about 7 days before I
 canceled. That was in February, 2015.
 Ever since I canceled, they have been sending me bills. They indicate that the balance due is $54.34.
 Once in February they sent me a late notice, but ever since then they just send me a monthly bill. The
 odd thing is that the amount doesn't increase, and they don't send late notices anymore.
 When I call customer service, they tell me that my account does appear to be canceled, but they
 continue to bill me. I have wasted hours discussing the matter, and each time I have to explain the
 whole story from scratch.
 I have an excellent credit rating, and I want to be sure that it remains so. Furthermore, I consider it
 harassment to be sent bills month after month for a service that I canceled.

I have to call each month to dispute the Comcast bill because it comes for a higher $ amount than what has been quoted to me by customer service. I have the names and dates of each time I have called in the last year and a half - just in last 6 months I have spoken with 5 different service people in 5 of 6 months. Each month they give me credits and we agree on the amt. the next bill should come for and the next month it comes for a higher amount. It takes a lot of time on the phone each time I call to explain what the problem is so sometimes it takes me a while to make the call and then late fees are added to my bill. You can see that I have paid consistently each month, but not by the due date each month. With my disability (health issues) I often don't feel good and it takes so much energy to gather my thoughts, notes that is takes me a while to call - I won't pay until the bill is adjusted to the agreed amount. I am only willing to pay $120 for combined internet & cable tv. This has become so stressfull that I am close to just cancelling with comcast all together. It is not fair for comcast to continue to make promises on what the monthly bill amount will be and then not keep them. They offer internet for low income, but the speed was so low it did not work to stream movies or search on the internet so I got a regular priced plan. There has to be a way I can get decent internet service with a high enough speed to stream movies and reasonably surf internet and basic cable tv with access to on-demand for not more then $100 to MAX $120 per month. (Sometimes we like to have HBO or Starz but usually only 1 at a time.) We by no means have any kind of deluxe package.) I should not have to call each month and negotiate for discounts and be lied to about promotions I'm being put on that will keep the bill at the agreed $120. Then I see constant offers where they are offering new customers phone, internet & tv for $99 but I can't get two out of the three for a consistant $120 Max. Please help. Sincerely, (PS In addition to the billing issue our wireless internet has not worked well for 12 of the 18 months we've had it at this address. We live in a less then 900 sq. ft home and have to use a wi-fi extender just to get wi-fi one room away from modem - so in addition to billing issues the internet service doesn't work well either.)

1874,"I first placed an order with Comcast for Internet service in February of this year. The first technician indicated that the service line between the house and street had been compromised and that I needed a new ""drop bury"". Comcast filed for a permit with the city of Seattle who came and marked underground obstacles some weeks later. After that I called Comcast to find out the status of the drop bury install at which point I was informed that it had already been installed a week prior. I was skeptical but they sent a technician out to install service for me about a week later. That technician confirmed that the drop bury had not been installed, and the process repeated. I have spoken with Comcast about 8 or 10 times now and each time they are at a loss as to why the drop bury has not been installed. I do not believe that they will make adequate attempts to remedy this issue without outside pressure. Anything that the FCC can do to help facilitate situation would be most appreciated.

 Thank you for helping me with the problems I'm having with Comcast. I figured I'm due for an update, but unfortunately I can't say they've been much help. In short, I've scheduled two appointments with them to have a technician come to my apartment, and no one ever showed up. Here is the log I've kept so far:
 Comcast Log
 June 12 – Comcast calls me (Cory – 410.931.5223) and sets up an appt for Monday June 15 to look at my internet between 5-7pm (specifically 6pm). I am informed that I will not be charged because (A) I use Comcast’s modem and (B) I live in an apartment and I am not responsible for keeping the wiring in good condition; the landlord is responsible.
 June 15 2:30pm – Comcast calls me and says, “I see you have an appt for today between 5-7pm, but we don’t ever come out between 5-7pm.” I am unavailable the rest of the week and will be out of town this coming weekend. WTF.
 I waited around to see if anyone would show up anyway. No one showed up for the scheduled appt.
 June 16 – Cory calls me as 4:55pm to check in with me. I told him about the call I received the day before and the fact that no one showed up, but all he had to say was, “Sorry, I didn’t know we don’t send people out between 5-7pm around here.” Okay? When the whole world relies so heavily on appointments and being on time, why is this company so shitty at it?
 Cory asked me when I would available again. I told him I am unavailable for the next couple of weeks. I’m visiting family this weekend for my nephew’s birthday, and Cory seems surprised that I am unwilling take off work (ie - use a vacation day) to sit around at home waiting for Comcast.
 I asked him to send a technician to check the wiring outside the building while I’m not home, but he seems unwilling. He ended the call with, “I’ll see what I can do.”
 June 17 – Still no word from Cory (2:30pm).
 June 18 – Cory calls to inform me that a technician was sent out yesterday, and that he found some exposed wires or something. It’s kind of hard to hear make out what he says exactly, but I don’t really care since it sounds like someone actually made it out. Cory goes on to say that they have to get someone into my apartment, though. Okay, fine. We schedule an apt for Saturday June 27 at 3-5pm. (I’m unable to schedule an appt. for the weekend of June 20 because I’m traveling home to PA to visit family for my nephew’s birthday).
 June 25 – I receive an automated call from Comcast to confirm my “guaranteed appt.” I received a few of these calls throughout the week, but kept missing them since I was always at the gym. I successfully received and confirmed the appt. today, though.
 June 26 – I receive a brief call from Cory just to confirm that we’re still on. I let me him know - yes, we are still on for the appt.
 June 27 – Throughout the entire day, no one from Comcast shows up. Why is this company so bad at time management?!?! (b) (6)"
1875,"When I called Comcast to resolve a website login issue, the tech did a reset of my account. Before I talked to the tech I was getting 20 megabits per second. After the call I am getting 2. I am paying for 25. The tech was unable to explain why my speed dropped and subsequent calls to tech support have not yielded any progress. They now are blaming the slow speed on my personal cable modem. They can't explain why my speed was fine before the call, but dropped after the call. I suspect they are intentionally throttling my speed to 2 mbps and the tech's reset some how trigger this. I would appreciate it if you could persuade them to return my speed to what I'm paying for.

1876,"The only option for broadband where I live is Comcast, so I was forced to sign up for it if I wanted the internet. When I called to set it up, I of course didn't have the internet where I lived because we had just moved in. While on the phone with the Comcast representative, I was told that if I signed up for a phone line, they would waive installation fees. They then e-mailed me a contract to sign, and pressured me to sign it while on the phone. Let me reiterate, Comcast e-mails contracts to people without the internet, and pushes for them to read it on their smartphone.
 So imaging my dismay when I get the first bill, and the phone line is $40 a month. Not only that, but I had signed a three year contract. I was told neither of those things while talking to the person from Comcast, only that signing up for a phone would waive installation fees. I have called Comcast repeatedly over the last 2 years to complain about paying $40 for a phone line that we don't use, with no recourse. They tell me that the only way to get rid of the phone line is to pay an ETF, or sign a new three year contract. What I decided to do was just ride the contract out, and cancel when it expires.
 What is especially silly about a three year contract is how slow my internet is, because I signed up for internet three years ago. There are currently Comcast internet options that are over 5x faster than I currently get, because of course internet speeds have increased in three years. Technically I don't even have broadband anymore, because we signed up for 20Mbps.
 The purpose of my story is in the hope that what happened to me will never happen to anybody else. I don't think Comcast should be allowed to bait and switch, by only telling you positive things, like ""your installation fees will be waived"", without also telling you ""but it will cost you $40, and $7.50 for equipment rental, a month"". Please stop Comcast from doing things like this in the future.

1877,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 2 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached 76 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill.
 This practice is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC. Comcast holds a complete monopoly in my area for broadband services.

1878,"My internet is habitually slow or continues to slow down during what I would consider peak hours several times a month. I've had to turn off wifi before and use regular 4G on my phone and iPad before because webpages would legitimately not load for minutes upon minutes or until websites would just time out. Even for websites as common as Google.
 I'm stuck in a pricy two year contract and I can't do anything about this issue. I just want reliable internet.

1879,"since having service installed at our location 7-8 years back (maybe longer) we have peroids of extreme packet loss (around 30-40%) as well as frequent jumps in routing slowness from an average of around 28-40ms to 250-500ms. In both cases it makes working from home (we have a business class line in order to facilitate no rate limiting or other shenanigans the home circuits deal with.) almost impossible.

1880,"Well we are back here again. Again being overcharged.
 I opened a complaint back in May, May 7 is the last correspondence date I have about the previous case. We had discussed changing it to $49.99 +taxes, etc. It was to be locked in for a year to avoid this again!
 Now we're back here because I was charged approximately $62.00 for not one, not two, but three months so far. The first representative told me two months, which ended up being around $20.00, the second representative told me $38.00, and now I just anticipate that number to go up even more.
 When I asked for a refund and not a credit... I was told by the second representative that they do have an over-charge refund (not credit) policy, but that this situation does not apply. I rebutted with, so you didn't over-charge me $38.00 so far, an over-charge is an over-charge regardless of any other information.
 It's disgusting that I have to forfeit a couple days of meals because of a corporations greed in desperately attempting to cling onto funds that it has wrongly taken from individuals. I am a full-time computer science student and I do not have EXTRA funds laying around that I can just come up with. The funds I get are to last me an entire month, it's hard but I have managed to do that with a lot of structure.
 All I ask is that I and everyone else are billed a correct number (it should be guaranteed to be correct with regulation) and that any funds that are taken improperly or incorrectly are RETURNED, not credited because the corporation does not want to pay the processing fees.
 This is the LAST straw with comcast for me. If this is rectified and another issue comes up, I will not even tolerate it and disconnect immediately. I will not continuously be having to escalate issues that could have been detoured. I asked them to please refund my money to my card before I file a complaint regarding this.

1881,"We had dates scheduled, we spoke to the tech himself who confirmed the dates to be correct and then never showed. When I contacted Comcast to find out where he was they acted as if it was no big deal that he didn't show. Let me say this is an issue as we are running a 69 unit condominium. This is a business with an association, realty group, concierge service, and most importantly our owners and guest. We are now going on 3 days with no internet and phone service. I have asked to speak with a manager and got the name of a gentleman named David Kersey. Put In calls to him, got no answer and his mail box is full. Jason Harris the comcast tech who I spoke with directly and who promised to be here on the 15th of April between 1-5 has yet to return my call and Comcast just keeps sending a request that someone service our business. But no one can give me a date and time of when this can be done! This is unacceptable! We have an online marketing team who will be here tomorrow 4/17/2015 and needs internet to do their job.

The current way is not easy or reliable.
 I have complained about this before. Whatever was done has not fixed it. I think it is time for the FCC to deal with this issue! It should never occur.

1887,"I was given a special price of $55.40 for my comcast service. I am on a fixed budget, I am disabled as my husband is also. I have to go south due to my cardiovascular collagen disease non-specific, because the winters are to harsh for me, and I can't move,and I am isolated. I don't drive, little to none. I don't have cell service in my locality and I have to have access to a phone and internet for communication, safety and health needs. I returned to CT May 3rd, 2015 I did not have any service in my home no internet or phone. I called and I was told service was on. On May 11,2015 it was discovered that my service was never activated.
 I rec'd a bill for $183.59. I have been working with Elizabeth Calbarese I think that is her name, (she is supposed to be from the corporate executive headquarters )who gave me the package for $55.40, which began on August 2014, elizabeth gave it to me for 2 years. I spoke with on occasion concerning my phone and that i was going to go on seasonal service and I did not want it to affect my current plan. She assured me that it wouldn't. I received my next bill for 106.57 plus the prior balance of 183.59 (But I had a credit from seasonal advance payments,credit was $3.85.) I have called Elizabeth many many times with no response. I am sending this letter that will hopefully be attached or mailed to you. Now I receive a threat of turning off my service. I am disabled I don;t have cell service and If they shut off my service I have no phone or way to communicate in any way.
 Comcast is the most terrible company I have ever had to deal with. there is no consistency,they are not honest and it does appear that they have a monopoly. GO to the comcast web-site look at all the complaints from Many, Many states. Now they are talking about merging with Time warner. This also can not happen. The consumers are trapped. Dealing with Comcast is a very time consuming exhausting experience. In all honesty i have been dealing with issues since 2008, static on the line,no service, dropped service, no phone. I had every repair man come and replace all my connections, one of them actually told me, (I will not release his name as there job is in jeopardy, but the problem exists outside,they need new wiring and replacement of old material etc)it was outside issue. When I call Comcast they have in their file that this was the consumers fault. This occurred every time. They are an underhanded company,they get the consumer from every angle. They block other companies,they are sneaky,not trustworthy and should not be allowed to merge with Time Warner.
 Please someone help me. I am also sending this to the Disability association AADP. Than you for your time

1888,"This week I received a automated message via home phone from Comcast as a warning that I had used 90% of my monthly data limit for home internet. I have never received any information from Comcast that I had a data limit for home wifi. I contacted them via online chat and asked them to provide me a list of usage, from which websites, days, times, amounts. They cannot provide these details. They only can tell me what I have used for the current month (90% of my 300GB which resets the 1st of the month), but they cannot prove it in anyway. If I reach my limit, I automatically will be charged $10 for an additional 50 GB (monthly limit is 300 GB). I am allowed 3 overages. Even this is not clear. 3 overages and then I get charged?? I also found out that I am in a test market in Atlanta for the data usage plan. How can they regulate which areas they serve with a data usage limit, and other that have no limit. My mobile phone company can provide me a detailed bill with every call, text message and time and amount data was used. I can verify my usage and pay accordingly. Why do we have to take Comacast's word for data used. They need to provide details. They should also provide details of when there service is not at the speed I am paying for.

I called right away, I was hung up on, told they couldn't speak to me, I wasn't on the account, I call back I was left on hold transferred. No one seemed to know how to help me. I then filed with the BBC and FCC, since then I have a supervisor ""Sharon"" ""trying to help"" she has BEEN NO HELP. She talks to me like I am stupid I have faxed her over 30 pages of items she needed for proof, she says the money was returned but it wasnt. I NEVER AUTORIZED AUTO PAY OR A PAYMENT TO COME OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT ON THE 9TH, I know you record the conversations so go ahead and look, IT CAME OUT THE 9th and my 3 daughters and I had nothing. Finally after 2 weeks I was able to get the 20th payment stopped, and since then I have been giving nothing but the run around and been treated as rude as possible.

1899,"On March 21, 2015 my comcast internet service went out. I called tech support to see if there a was problem with my modem or service and tech support advised that my modem was showing off line. On March 22, 2015 I went to my local walamrt and purchased another modem and called comcast to add and activate the new modem to my account. I was told again that it was showing that the modem was showing offline. On March 23, 2015 I purchased yet another modem and called comcast to get it added & activated on my account, & and was told yet again that the modem was showing offline. The 3rd tech support person finally figured out that it was a service issue and not my equipment, so he scheduled a tech to come out. On March 26, 2915 the service came to my house and checked the wiring & outlet in my apartment and said there was nothing wrong and that he would need to check the service on the pole. He came back into my apartment after being outside for 10 minutes and showed me a small silver tube and told me it was a filter and that is what is causing the interruption in my service. He said that a supervisor had placed the filter on the pole and that he could not take it off, so he ran a hard line from the connection to the building straight into my apartment. Finally the internet is working. On April 30 2015 I get my bill from comcast and am surprised that there is a $35.00 internet install fee. I called to explain the situation and have the fee removed. That's when I was hit with an even bigger shocker, the supervisor informed me that in the future there would be either a $70 or $35 fee for a tech to come out to my house if there was ever another service. So I asked why would you charge a customer an install fee if they have had working service with your company for 14 months at the same location, especially since the service coming from the pole was the problem and not inside the house? I was told again that if I had another service call in the future, regardless of the reason I would be charged this fee. So basically if their service goes down and I have to call them, comcast will try and extort between $35 to $70 to repair their own service.

 my work email in 2013 and 2014. I no longer work for my former employer so I moved my group to
 my home email which is supplied by Comcast. When I attempted to use my group it was refused by
 two error messages one of which kept telling me that the server was slow and my request could not
 be processed. I made five telephone calls to Comcast to fix the problem. All of the people I talked to
 told me they could not fix the problem and that they were referring the matter to high ups in the
 Comcast hierarchy for a solution. I was given ""ticket"" numbers each time and I was told that
 someone would call me. That never happened. I began testing connections with individual group
 members and found that. I found that about 8 members of the group could not receive individual
 emails. Last night at about 9:15 P.M. I received a telephone call from Comcast telling me that the
 problem could not be fixed. They suggested that I buy a new email server client (Outlook) even
 though they previously told me that that was not a solution. The person I talked to even said that my
 prior success with my group at work was because that was ""business"" email.
 I our area Comcast has a virtual monopoly on private internet service. They have better speed and
 easy connection. they have no motivation top solve the problem because I have no where else to go.
 This company need to be regulated like a public utility.

 The carrier did not fix the problem. The service will not identify bad email addresses and respond with
 identification of these addresses while sending out to the rest of the group
 . As such, there is no way to find out if an address is bad unless you send an individual message to
 each address.
 When all the email addresses are valid the service sends to the group but I am given an error
 message. I forwarded this to Comcast and they said it was a ""calendar"" problem. I do m=not use the
 calendar feature and I fail to understand how that could be part of that and email transmission

I'm told until I pay it they can't credit the account and they won't restore services.

 The part that is the most disturbing is that I tried to create a hotspot using my cell phone which is not part of Comcast and Comcast hijacked those services which I pay another provider and wouldn't allow me to create a hotspot using my cell phone which is by another provider. This is some kind of tactic. I'm sure this violates some type of law.

1907,"My fiancé and I purchased/settled on a new construction town-home on March 18, 2015. Prior to our settlement date, on February 11, 2015, my fiancé called Comcast to inquire about setting up cable and internet services at our new residence. Although the neighborhood that we were purchasing in was an established one, our new home was the first town-home strip on a newly established street. The representative that my fiancé spoke to was very helpful and said that she would need to inquire about when service would be available on our street, because at the time our new address was not showing in the Comcast database. The representative called and left a voice mail the following day on my fiancé's phone explaining that our new home was listed as a ""future build""- this was explained as a new area that wasn't serviceable at the time of our call, but would be in the future. We were left with the expectation that we would be a serviceable address within 90-120 days of the voice mail that was left. Although we were disappointed, we were also understanding that we were buying new construction and these things take time.
 Closer to our settlement date, after our address was registered with the postal service, we reached out to our sales representative from the builder and explained our cable/internet findings with her. She said that she has encountered this before and she said that she had experience with this and would reach out to Comcast for us. She came back with her findings for us on our settlement date. She had spoken to a representative and provided him the details of the problem we were encountering. His instructions were for my fiancé and I to go to the Comcast servicing center and provide them with our settlement sheet and a photo ID, and they would set our address up in their system to service.
 We followed the representative's instructions and went to the servicing center the day after settlement, March 19, 2015. The representative that we spoke to there, took our settlement sheet to the back of the office to speak to the construction manager. She came back to the desk and said that the construction manager said that our street was not serviceable at this time, but would definitely be within the next month. Again, we were disappointed, but understanding because we had just bought new construction.
 Around May 1, 2015 I began to call and inquire of where we stood for being serviced, because we hadn't seen any activity in regards to cables being laid. However, we did see activity in the town-home strip in front of our home, which sparked our interest. When I called the representative that had helped us in the servicing area, she said that she would need to speak to the construction manager and get back in touch with me by the end of the business day. I never heard back from her. I called back a few days later and requested the construction manager's name and contact information, which I was told would be sent to me via e-mail, I never received the email with the information. When I called back a few days later, my question of the construction manager's information was overlooked, and I was told that service would be available to me ""soon"" - which is essentially the same response I had been receiving for three months.
 On May 20, 2015 cable lines were run to our strip of town-homes. The cable lines were run and dug underground and there are cable lines in front of all eight town-homes next to our electrical meters. I called to inquire about where the process was and how soon our home would be able to be serviced. I was given a guarantee date to have service available to me by May 23, 2015. I was told that all that needed to be done at this point, was that the construction manager needed to sign off on the work that had been done, and add our address to the system. Once that was complete our home would be serviceable.
 On May 26, 2015 I began calling the service center with no answer. I tried at different times of the day, multiple times a day, with no answer. On June 8, 2015, I went into the service center, completely fed up with the lack of response to my calls. I spoke to the representative that I had been dealing with since March 19, 2015. I explained to her again that the cable had been run out front of my home and reminded her of what she had told me needed to be done after that. I also reminded her of the guarantee dates she had given me. She told me that the process of servicing my home was being held up because there was a payment issue between Comcast and the third party contractor that they use to lay the cable lines.
 At the beginning of this process, 128 days ago from today's date, my fiancé and I were very understanding of the process that needed to take place because we purchased a new construction home. As time has gone on, we find it completely unacceptable the way that we've been given the run-around as to when we will be able to have service in our home. At this time, we have had a cable on the front of our home, next to our electric meter for 27 days, with no follow up from a construction manager. As two full-time college students, working on a undergraduate and a graduate degree while working full-time, this has been a complete inconvenience. The payment issue between Comcast and the third party contractor, should not affect the Comcast construction manager surveying the work that has been done and checking off that our address serviceable. Unfortunately for us, Comcast is the only option of reliable internet and cable in our area. I feel as though Comcast is dragging their feet, because they know that they can, because we have no other options.

1908,"I have been a customer of Comcast since they came to Atlanta and they have never informed the customer of a 300GB cap. Last year I received my first ""warning"" about going over my 300GB limit. My first thought was ""how is this possible"" and then ""when did they put a limit in place?"" Having this cap is ridiculous and I feel that its a way to get money for the cable TV cutters. Yesterday I got my second notice that I am at 90% of my total 300GB limit and I will be charged additional fees if I go over. So now I have to restrict my usage of internet??? As I read through people's comments, a lot of people say to get the business class version and you pay more with unlimited data but you also have to sign a contract. I refuse to be anymore involved with Comcast than I already am! I only though hotspots had limits but never residential internet service. Comcast is slowly taking over and making restrictions that are unfair to the consumer. Comcast needs to have more competition! Google Fiber cant come soon enough.

1909,"Comcast has begun charging additional fees for exceeding the broadband data limit. Yet, when I first got a message on my phone about it, I checked my information on the Internet Essentials Program, and it did not appear that it would affect my family. However, they have begun charging me $30-$60 more monthly, and I still do not see any info about a data limit on the new Internet Essentials information that is being passed out to prospective customers now. Do they wait for new customers to sign up before they tell them that they will actually have to pay more than $9.99 if they actually use the internet? I also do not understand why they can just claim that I have used too much data and charge me what ever they want. If I had a cell phone and went over my data usage, I could verify this with my phone, but I cannot verify the data that Comcast says I used. It is either impossible, or I just do not know how. Are we really supposed to trust them not to manipulate the numbers or make an error? Also, since I have had someone break into my network repeatedly and change my settings and even my password twice, how do I know how much of the data usage was actually me. The only way I know that others have been on my internet is when they change my network name to “defaultpasswordsarenotsafe,” or some other not-so-cute phrase, but I do not know if they have cracked my new username and password until they do something like this, so I do not know how much of my broadband they have used, nor would I be able to get them to pay me for it, if I could figure out who it was. Obviously I should not have to pay for their use of my broadband, but that is the risk we all face these days. In addition, since Comcast suddenly became extremely slow, though they claim they raised the speed, I believe the lag is due to an increase in advertisements, which I am now paying to receive. I think it is pretty ironic that Comcast started charging for each GB of data right about the same time that the ads became so bad that it severely slowed down the Internet. I will not be able to stay on Internet Essentials, because I cannot afford it. Are any other companies offering a discounted Internet service for people who could not afford $40-$70 per month for Internet Essentials?

1910,"We were in the ""test"" group for 300 gigabyte limits. They have since made this a rule for everyone. We have 5 people in the house watching youtube, playing games. If you buy a game, like say GTA V, on steam the download itself is 60 gigabytes. That a huge amount of the monthly limit. It's ruining our ability to enjoy our entertainment. The limit shouldn't exist, it's only here to milk more money. I can't even go to a competitor because the ""blazing fast"" 15 mbps is impossible to get anywhere else. That isn't even fast.

1911,"Within one month of using Comcasts performance internet package in the Nashville metro area, I am being informed that I have exceeded the data cap limits. I find the 300gb limit to be grossly misrepresentative of the common Nashville residents Internet usage. As a growing tech city, Nashville continues to gain tech-heavy professionals who, like myself, are operating in a data rich world for work and personal endeavors. It costs nothing for comcast to increase data caps or remove them entirely. This is purely a profit move by comcast to get more money out of users. I think that if Comcast wants to provide more expensive services then that is their prerogative but to slap on a bunch of outdated fees seems unnecessary. I would like to see this cap removed from my account and for billing to be handled in a professional and honest fashion.

1912,"I filed a complaint a few months ago, (Ticket No. 253999). After literally years of going back and forth
 with comcast, paying over a thousand dollars and still no service. Thanks to the FCC, those issues
 were resolved and I sigh]ned up for the largest, fastest package comcast offered.
 All of a sudden, I am getting notices that I have exceeded my data limit for internet usage. I was not
 aware I had a limit. I was not made aware of a limit. Possibly because many of my communications
 was via phone calls, this detail was overlooked. Nonetheless, I have contacted comcast twice, with
 no response at all. Hopefully the FCC can come to the rescue and help resolve this issue as well"

1914,"I discontinued my service with Comcast on March 17th and returned the products shortly thereafter. Since that time I have spoken to numerous customer service representatives and supervisors in regards to my refund of $225.70 and was told each time by the representatives that the refund has been processed and I would receive it within 15 business days.
 Almost 2 weeks ago I was contacted by someone by the name of Karla who is a secretary for Tom Karinsshak and was guaranteed that they would be sending a funds via an expedited method.
 This is absolutely ridiculous that now 3 months after they have received my product I have yet to receive my refund.

1915,"I have purchased internet service from Comcast for years simply due to a lack of competition in my local area, there are two choices, Comcast (cable internet) v CenturyLink (dsl); dsl is currently an inferior access product given speed limitations, so I'm stuck with Comcast. I do not buy any other service from Comcast as a result I pay more per month for the same internet access speed as someone who purchases at least two of their services in a bundle. How is it that the same level of service could possibly cost more to provide that type of service given the exact same infrastructure is used -- it doesn't cost more, this is simply a way for Comcast to continue gouging consumers as they have done for years, given a complete lack of competition; as a result they are easily acting in a monopolistic way within an oligopolistic marketplace, neither company has any incentive to do much for any customer, why would they, we're stuck , our choice is completely limited, we're hostages, not customers.

I also chatted with on-line rep to re-check the price on my package and again I was told 44.99+tax. A few days later, then I received the bill, it was 49.99 + tax. I did call customer service and the false-promised to resolve the issue for me and kept me on open tickets for 21 days.

 Hi,
 Although Comcast has tried to help me with my complaint in past several weeks, there is no actual resolution to the issue. (b) (6)
 Comcast representatives called me/e-mailed me and promised to adjust the rate to new discounted rate, I still received a new bill with original rate (49.99+tax), for which I had initiated complaint with FCC.
 It seems Comcast is even giving false information to FCC that they have resolved the issue for customers.
 Thank you for the help in this matter.
 ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 This ticket (#359191 (https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/requests/359191)) has been updated."
1918,"Recently, I eliminated my cable service and landline from my Comcast account because the bill kept creeping higher and higher. When I spoke with the customer service representative, I asked for the lowest rate possible to keep just the internet service. I was told it would cost $78.95 for the internet and $10 for modem rental. I asked if this was the only option and was told that it was. Later, looking at my bill, I realized that Comcast had charged me for both their Performance Internet for $66.95/mo. and and their Blast Internet for $12/mo. The Blast is considered an upgrade and it was placed on my account by Comcast in order to charge me more. I did not request it as I was not informed of the breakdown of the bill. I was given one rate and told there was no other choice. There was no indication that these were two separate charges by the representative. This is misleading and a deceptive business practice. There has also been no increase in my Internet speed since the addition of this Blast upgrade, which is purportedly 50 mbps, to Performance's 25 mbps. It is also clear that Comcast has become a de facto monopoly, as there are no other viable Internet options in this area. It is not in consumers' best interests to have no options for necessary services in the marketplace.

 A Comcast representative contacted me two weeks ago regarding my complaint. She said that the representative that I spoke with to eliminate cable and keep only internet should have informed me of the available lower-priced options, and the fact that he didn't was an oversight. She said she would email me a list of the more economical options that are available, but has not yet done so. I asked her to let management know that all representatives should be advised to inform consumers of the lower-priced options when it is requested. My assertion that Comcast is a de facto monopoly still holds true, but there seems to be no mechanism by which to address this fact. I would like to request that the FCC contact me to let me know what other options consumers have when there is no viable internet service offered by any other company in my area. Thank you."

I continually find my download rates throttled, and lowered, only to then receive the opportunity to pay more to speed up my connection (which only brings it back up to the original speed I had before they throttled my speed). I have no other options, so Comcast can continue to play this game of lowering my speed and charging me to get it back. This has enabled Comcast to ratchet up prices while not providing any improvements in service. I now pay 4 times what I used to, my internet is slower than ever, and I have no alternatives to chose from. This is not fair, this is not a free market, and this is an unacceptable state of affairs for the United States of America.

1922,"I signed up for a 2 year commitment from Comcast in order to fix my monthly expenses. Comcast
 even said they would give me 3 months of ""Stars"" for free...all for a combined TV and internet
 monthly fee of $113. Well, my bill just went up over $40! No notice, no nothing.
 I am tired of Comcast jerking people around. I am totally for government regulation on this company.
 I would like someone to hold Comcast accountable for their actions!!!!
 I would like to see them fined and regulated!!!!
 So frustrated!"
1923,"I was working with an account executive (Lee_Williams@cable.comcast.com) at Comcast to try to resolve a billing/account issue. First contact was on 4/16/2015. The issue has not been resolved, and I have not received any further communication from him since 4/20/2015. I called today and he is not in the office, and the issue is still not resolved.
 We moved our office in Crown Point, IN from 1003 E Summit St to a temporary location at 1121 Breuckman Dr. due to our lease expiring and construction on our new permanent location not being completed. Relevant documentation and move order are attached. Approximately three months later, we moved into our current location at 1189 E Summit St. This required a significant amount of construction on Comcast's part to trench under a parking lot to get service to the new building.
 It was brought to my attention in roughly December of 2013 that AP had been paying for two accounts for the Crown Point, IN office without bothering to notify anyone responsible for those accounts. After investigating, I realized that we had two open accounts with Comcast for that office, one for the 1003 Summit St. location, and one for the 1121 Breuckman St. location, but no account for the 1189 E Summit St. location. After numerous contacts with Comcast, I thought I had this issue resolved roughly January of 2014. I was informed again in early April of 2015 that the issue was still ongoing, and am attempting to resolve the issue again, so far without success.
 Comcast has as of yet made no progress towards rectifying this situation. Just to get in touch with the rep who I have been dealing with this time required me to make a trip to the local Comcast office to lodge a complaint with the manager there, who contacted their Corporate offices, who put me in touch with that rep, as I was tired of being repeatedly hung up on by lower level reps at phone support. At this time, I have spent somewhere in excess of 16hrs of my time trying to resolve this issue.
 I am requesting that the billing issues be resolved. This involves either closing or consolidating the duplicate accounts, rectifying the service address to reflect the correct location, and refund or account credit for the duration of the double billing, as well as reparations for the egregious amount of time I have had to waste trying to rectify this issue.
 Any possible assistance in getting this issue resolved would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you, (b) (6)

1925,"I have had multiple issues with my Comcast service since signing my contract with them. I have spent hours of my time on the phone with their ""customer service"" and have not one time been satisfied with the outcome. I always get the run-around from every employee and not one of them has ever resolved my issue. My cable TV system constantly freezes, or says ""xfinity service is currently not available, please try back later"". And I was told that we were receiving ""fast in-home wifi"" for our tiny apartment, but still can't even watch a single video without it constantly freezing. And this is even when there is one device connect to the wifi.. Even though we were told you could use multiple devices at once. I have finally given up trying to get help from Comcast because they seem like they could not care any less about my situation, but still continue to take my payment every month. Therefore I looked around online and saw that I could file a complaint through the FCC, and here I am. I just don't understand how a company can be so unresponsive, unhelpful and deceptive as Comcast. I have never been more unhappy with a company in my entire life.

There has been no notice of this change to our agreement with Comcast. Additionally the tool they provide does not accurately track the data use (in app they provide it says we have used 248 in one area and 270 in another area) and there is no detail as to what is using the data or when.

 Comcast contacted us and said that Sharon Sullivan a corporate specialist would be helping us. We
 spoke with her at 10:05 on May 29, 2015. She said to pay $92.05 for the June bill and then we would
 be charged $138.96 plus tax for the next 9 months. We payed the $92.05. As of 6-22-2015, when we
 check our account status via telephone, we are informed that we are $168.41 behind in payments.
 We called customer service and talked with Thomas at 7:45pm. He says that is wrong. We were
 $7.06 short on our last payment and have a $9.50 late payment fee. He says he has taken care of
 this, but we cannot see the new bill for about a week. So Sharon did not correct our bill . Our
 complaint is still open and we need help resolving this. We still have not received a correct bill. We
 are still getting a different answer with every person we talk too."
1930,"I live at in South Lyon MI. All internet providers contracted to this area, have refused to service my address despite all lines being present on my street. Comcast is the contracted provider for my township. They have stated that for a mere $12,000.00 they will run a line to the main street to my street, Johns Rd.
 I live in a major urban area, 10 minutes from 12 Oaks Mall. 3 minutes from Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Lowes, HomeDepot, Meijers, and many other restaurant and shopping facilities. Two major high schools are at the ends of the main road within 1-2 miles from my street. A country golf club is across the street from mine.
 This one mile of road has been ignored and neglected by the contracted cable company Comcast. They have repeatedly tried to extort thousands of dollars from the more than 20 families who have tried to get service. This is outrageous that these multi million dollar companies will not service their contracted areas and provide basic internet service, which I understand is considered a basic utility in this day and age.
 I am requesting assistance to obtain this basic service at the same cost and rates as every one else this provider is contracted to serve.

 so i had a enough and filed a fcc complaint so last week they called me and a tech actually showed up and said yep there is a problem in the line see attachement and they send out the crew to fix it.
 i got a call twice for compensation and all they offered me is 1 month of services. i told them why would u think that i would just accept your violation u charge for a service that i never received like bernie madoff ... and then u offer me one month .... u didnt provide services and so i need to be compensated for the whole year of no service .

1942,"Consumer said that he has Comcast and thinks they are not doing business right. He said they were supposed to give him a $20 credit however it wasn’t added. When he tried to call Comcast the supervisor gave him the run around. He said they have lied to him about this and he thinks that they should have kept their word. He said he was supposed to get this credit because no one came to his schedule appointment. The tech was supposed to be there from 8-10 however he didn’t show up until the afternoon. Comcast is saying that their records don’t show this but he said that is what he was told because the tech didn’t show up at the appointment time. As a resolution he would like Comcast to keep their word. If they tell a consumer something then the company should stick to that. ***CTR 354-phone***

1943,"Comcast is knowingly engaging in fraudulent, deceptive, and erroneous billing.
 I cancelled service on this account on April 03, 2015. I was advised to wait for final bill, containing
 adjustments, before paying final amount.
 Comcast erroneously billed a late fee of $9.50 April 08, 2015, on bill dated April 08, 2015.
 The final bill on April 14, 2015, did not contain a refund for the $9.50.
 Concerned, I called Comcast on April 22, 2015, and spoke with a Supervisor, in Billing, Alex, id
 SAN0314. He confirmed the modem was returned. He stated that the $9.50 refund is reflected in my
 current balance of $37.40, even though there is no line item for the refund. He stated that the $9.50
 refund was “included” on Page 2 of the April 14, 2015, bill, in the calculations under “Partial Month
 Charges & Credits.” However, he acknowledged that the section only includes “Voice/Data Modem
 Rental,” “Performance Internet,” “Service Discount,” “Speed Increase,” and “Service Discount,” and
 includes no line item for a refund of the erroneous late fee.
 Alex stated that Comcast was aware of the issue involving customers’ final bills, and implied that
 Comcast’s calculations for the above-listed items were erroneous, deceptive, and fraudulent, as to
 purportedly include a credit that is not listed.
 Comcast should not be engaging in a practice of printing erroneous, deceptive, and fraudulent
 information on people's bills.
 When I told Alex that I would be filing a complaint with appropriate regulatory agencies, he said,
 “Good. That is the only way that change will happen.”
 I am requesting:
 (1) A refund of the $9.50, for which there is no record of a refund.
 (2) Policy change, to ensure that customers' final bills are correct in the future.
 (3) A refund of the remaining $27.90 on my account, for the inconvenience of having to call Comcast
 and file an FCC complaint.
 (4) A credit for two months of Internet service on my other Comcast account (on Apt. 35 in the same
 building), also for the inconvenience."

1947,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

1950,"I recently read an article on Ars Technica about filing a complaint with the FCC to lower my Comcast bill. Here is a link, http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/want%C2%AD-a-lower-comcast-bill-complain-to-the-fcc/
 Because I am a good person, I decided to call Comcast in order to resolve my billing complaint without filing the complaint with the FCC first. After repeated tries, I am completely UNABLE to speak with a customer service representative about my billing issues! Every time I try, I am shuffled from one robot voice to another. When I am finally able to choose to speak with a customer service representative about my billing issues (by dialing 3 at the right time), The robot voice tells me to go to the website instead (after 5 full minutes of talking to robots)! Then the robot HANGS UP ON ME!
 This kind of practice is absolutely UNJUST and UNREASONABLE! As of now, I am unable to speak with ANY customer support representative about my billing issues. This kind of horrible and despicable customer support would not be possible if Comcast did not have a monopoly on high speed cable internet in Houston. Every interaction I have had with Comcast throughout my 3 years of service has been a slog through robot voices and transferring to other departments. I need these horrible business practices to be noted by the proper authorities. I am sick of dealing with these issues because of Comcast's monopoly. If I could switch to a comparable internet service provider with better customer service, I would do so in a heartbeat!

1951,"For over 12 months we have been in a monthly battle with Comcast trying to get our billing account fixed, so we can log in and pay our bill and make any necessary adjustments to our account. Literally every month, I have to visit the Comcast chat support, and run through the same unsuccessful steps with a technical support agent. We've come to the conclusion that there is a ""technical issue with my account"". I am promised a call back from their technical team, which I never receive. I have asked numerous times to have this corrected, with absolutely zero success. The level of technical expertise offered by their ""technical"" support is absolutely dismal and unprofessional. The only reason I am continuing to remain a customer is the service itself has been fine. I can get nothing accomplished other than paying my bill every month. If this doesn't change I will absolutely consider an alternative ISP. Having worked in technical support for a number of years, I am personally surprised that they allow for this lack of support to be provided to their customers.

1954,"I called and had Comcast set up cable and internet at my new apartment in Spring Lake, North Carolina. It took 3 hours on the phone to set up the cable and internet. They told me they would come to my apartment to set up the cable and internet and gave me a 4 hour window. They did not call me before they came and they were almost late. The only reason they were on time was because I called a customer service line to get in contact with the local Comcast office and had them make a local call to find out who would be assisting me. The cable guy apparently got lost trying to find the apartment and did not even try to call to find where I was. He costed my entire morning and afternoon by being late. I also used a Power of Attorney to create this account under my husbands name and they never even asked for a copy of it. I tried calling to get account information to see what our bill would be and they said no such account exists. We have cable and internet and no account number and no way to pull up the account even with the address and social security number. This company is awful. First of all it is illegal not to have the Power of Attorney which I would have happily emailed to them if they had followed through with our account and had asked and second they opened an account under my husband's social security number and did not provide billing information or an account number to access the account so if we are late it affects our credit. I just want to pay my husbands and I's bill online and on time and we want to get the help we need to update our account. We do not have a lot of spare time with him being in the military and me starting nursing school. We really need help!!

1955,"I had a 12 month contract agreement with Comcast for a rate of $62.00 per month. For the past 5 months I have been charged for a ""modem lease fee"" of $10.00. I have informed Comcast every month, for the past 5 months, that I in fact am NOT renting a modem from them. I purchased my own cable modem when I first signed up with them. They have been given the serial number to my modem many times and yet, somehow, no one seems to know how to fix this problem. Now, I am owed $50.00 from Comcast and they STILL aren't paying it. My current bill for this month is $96.00. I was advised that it will not reflect on this bill, and that next month my bill will reflect the $50.00 credit owed to me. I have cancelled all services with Comcast and won't hold my breath about receiving the money that is owed to me.

 experiencing were not specific to my home. Reviewing my cable lines does not address the issue that I brought to the attention of the FCC which is that YOUR DISTRIBUTOR is losing signal on a regular basis. Since your distributor's system is not at my home looking at my cables is not fixing the root source of the problem. I would like to know if Comcast has identified the root source of your distributor's issues and when you will be fixing those. Otherwise, this is still all an attempt to pass the blame off of Comcast.

1960,"I was pushed by Comcast into signing up for both their Internet service and Cable TV service. I do not use their cable TV service and called them recently to cancel this portion of my service. I was told that if I cancelled with them, I would still pay the exact same price as I presently do for Internet service. I have noticed that my charges have increased from $60 to almost $90 plus taxes and various ancillary fees for these services, one of which I do not use.
 I have tried to discuss this with a support representative but they are not helpful. I would appreciate your assistance in resolving these unfair billing practices as I do not have another reliable option for Internet service at my current address.

1961,"There are currently 2 realistic ISP's in Springfield, IL which are Comcast and AT&T. I am currently a customer of Comcast which refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television and request only internet. In fact, the price increases by nearly $15 dollars a month for the reduced service of solely internet. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package is ""$55 dollars a month"" however, Comcast adds a an additional $10 modem fee each month and with taxes the total is $70 monthly. However, 2 years ago the total bill for the exact same services was $50 monthly after taxes and fees.
 Due to the increased price of solely internet, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 2 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, decreased services would lead to a decreased price. However, in Comcast's world, you are forced to take on services that you never use or face a significantly increased monthly rate.
 Similarly, I have called AT&T and they refuse to offer solely internet as well. As is the case with Comcast, getting only internet actually increases your monthly bill.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 This may seem like a petty expense, but I am trying to buy my first car. Without cutting other unnecessary expenses like cable I very well may not be able to do so. In effect, Comcast is limiting my ability to contribute to other sectors of the economy through overcharging for services that I do not need.
 Thank you very much for your consideration.

1962,"I own the modem (JPEG Files) that I use with Comcast (purchased 2012). When I was using a high speed and their phone service I rented their modem. I lowered my internet speed, cancelled television service, and returned their equipment on March 5, 2015 as the scanned receipt (Scan 0002). I called on 5/28/15 because I noticed the charge for a rented DOCSIS 3 modem and was escalated to Bernard at the Executive level (Complaint ID 029268603) who asked for 15 days to resolve the problem. I said I will give you 30 days (6/28/15). I have not heard from Comcast and received a new bill over the weekend with yet another charge for this modem.

1964,"Was provided with a known faulty modem when services first started. Had issues with my services for 4 months. Limited connectivity, slow speeds, frequent disconnects, etc. After discovering what the issue was myself, i took charge and demanded a new modem. now my services are fine since hooking up new modem. Comcast charged me full price for those months of limited service and now is only offering a $20 credit for inconvenience. Was told by comcast rep, when i traded in the faulty modem, that i need to be credited half of each month of limited services, and to contact comcast billing to do so. Comcast billing will not refund me appropriate amount, nor will address my issue directly. They constantly transfer me and never actually try to assist the issue at hand. It doesnt seem right to be charged full price for something when you only get half the use.

1965,"I have been trying to get Comcast to investigate and resolve Internet quality and consistency issues for the last month, and they've promised that they will investigate and call me back within 24-48 hours. They've never called me back. And they keep closing the cases as resolved with no documentation of why, when the issues are not resolved. Our Internet quality is horrible, frequent spikes of high packet loss, especially during the evening (when no technician can come out). Comcast also refuses to compensate me for the poor quality of service until the issue is resolved: Which means I'm forced to continue paying for poor quality of service. Lastly, each and every time I call, they push me to add additional services and features. I've had to beg and plead with them to stop trying to upsell me, and please address and resolve my ongoing issue.

1966,"I am reluctant to file this complaint fearing retribution in the form of service reduction or similar harassment from the subject of my complaint - Comcast Cablevision, Inc. (account )
 Following hours of conversations with numerous Comcast 800 number representatives concerning over-charges, I received two E-Mail (attached). You can see they are essentially the same stating my monthly rate for telephone, TV and Internet at $115.24.
 These E-Mail represent a Comcast commitment. Yet, on April 3, 2015 I received a telephone call from a Comcast representative about 12:15PM local time named Eve. Her apparent intention, it seemed, to increase my rate to approximately $120 for some reason. I read to her information directly from the Comcast E-Mail. This seemed of little interest to her. Finally, I became exasperated by her inappropriate, persistent, overly assertive and aggressive attitude and terminated the call.
 I expect Comcast to contact me concerning his complaint and should do so at 904-824-5866. It would be appropriate if I received a call from a person more senior than those I have spoken to before. At this point a paper letter signed by a senior Comcast executive restating information I have received in the two attached E-Mail would be appropriate .

1967,"Half Hitch Marine Services Inc, located at 134 Riberia St, Suite 10, St Augustine, FL, is in the process of being liquidated. I am the Vice President. The business had digital phone/internet service provided by Comcast, On 5/18/15, I called Comcast to notify them of the liquidation and have the phone/internet service disconnected. I spoke with Jim in the Comcast Business division, who said that to disconnect the service, I needed to provide the account's security PIN. I provided him with the number I had on file (9772), which he said was incorrect; he then made arrangements to mail me the correct PIN. When I received the PIN in the mail, it was the same number I had provided on 5/18. I called Comcast Business again on 5/22 and was connected initially with Dana. After providing her with all the same information I had provided Jim on 5/18, including the PIN, I got disconnected and had to call in again. This time, I spoke with Nicole Clancy, again providing all the same info I had already provided. After signing and returning the disconnect request document Comcast requires, I advised Nicole that the service was being disconnected because the business was being liquidated, and as such, the 60 day waiting period for disconnects did not apply, as per Comcast's Business Service Terms and Conditions, article 5.2(c). Nicole said that she needed a document indicating the business was being terminated, so I suggested I could email her the Articles of Dissolution filed with the State of Florida. She said that would be acceptable proof so I emailed her those documents on 5/22 and received an email from her confirming receipt and stating that she would process the documents. A copy of those emails is attached. Two days later, on 5/24/15, the president of Half Hitch Marine, Richard Hill (whose email address was also on the Comcast records) received an email stating the request for disconnect had been received and would take effect on 6/21/15. Since this was not what Nicole and I had agreed to, I followed up with an email to Nicole on 5/27 asking her to confirm that the service disconnect for billing purposes would be 5/22 as we had discussed. I didn't receive a response from Nicole, so on 6/2, I checked the account on-line to see if the disconnect date had been corrected. I couldn't find any record of a disconnect order associated with the account at all, so I emailed Nicole again (copy attached) and asked her to confirm both that the disconnect order was still outstanding and that the billing disconnect date would be 5/22/15. As of today, 6/5, I've had no response from Nicole, there is still no indication of a pending disconnect order, and the account on-line shows a new bill outstanding for another month of service, from 6/14 to 7/14. In fact, Comcast has already been paid through 6/13, and as such owes Half Hitch Marine a refund for service from 5/22 to 6/13. I don't know whether this is an intentional attempt on Comcast's part to be paid for service far beyond the date that their own contract allows or if it is just incompetence of the part of its customer service people, but in either case it's unacceptable.

1968,"Complete lack of knowledge and service when starting service with Comcast, starting with previous owner of house and their service to incorrect information regarding self installation kit, to appointment no shows, no email correspondence and discounts promised but never given. Now I have a charge for the 4th service call where a tech actually showed up to install my internet when I was told I could do self installation, then had to get a tech, now they are charging me $70. I was lied to, given incorrect information and it took three orders for me to even get service which I had to drive to a different county to pick up my equipment. No one returned phone calls, I had a call where I was told I was speaking to a supervisor and when I called back I was told he was lying and wasnt a supervisor and had not completed what he told me he would do for my account. You will also notice that I am being charged a sales tax for ""TV"". I do not have any television services with Comcast

1970,"I have been paying Comcast/XFinity for 50mbps for internet speed since January 2014. 2 weeks ago I did a speed test and determined that my speed was 12 mbps. I called Comcast and was told that the modem they installed (and I pay $10 a month for) cannot handle 50mbps. They were supposed to send me a new one, at a charge to me. This order has been cancelled twice by Comcast, with no notice or explanation. I have spent no less that 12 hours on the phone and have made over 20 phone calls attempting a resolution. When I dial the number, I have to dial 3-4 times, as the first 2-3 times I get a tri-tone stating I can't dial that number from my area. Once I finally get connected, I have to listen to several ""advertisements"" in order to speak to someone. Usually, the call ends at that time for whatever reason. I then have to start over with the 3-4 calls, listen to the advertisements, make the selection about the survey (which they've only called back once). I have toggled back and forth between ""I'll take the survey"" and ""I don't want to take the survey"" because I'm not sure if that is why my call is disconnected. I cannot believe a company is permitted to charge what they do, not provide the service, and put their customers through hell trying to get a resolution.

1971,"I ordered HBO through Comcast. I went to set it up so that I could watch HBO Go through my Sony
 Playstation 3 by downloading the corresponding app on my PS3. When I tried to activate it, I couldn't
 because Comcast does not allow streaming HBO Go through the PS3, while other internet
 companies do. I was confused why Comcast would prevent this, and wonder if it violates newly
 enacted net neutrality rules."
1972,"I was talked into upgrading my service to include home phone because it would be less expensive than the same level of internet and cable service without phone. I explained to the sales rep that I did not own a home phone and would not use the service. They told me that was ok it didn't matter. I let the sales rep know that I owned my own modem and didn't want to receive a phone capable modem, also told that wasn't a problem. Made the service change in September 2014, checked the next bill and it was fine. Starting in November I began being charged for a modem but didn't realize it for a few months. Once I found out about the error I made several attempts to reach someone that could fix the issue giving up after wait times in excess of 30 minutes per call. Comcast allows you to add or upgrade service with the click of a mouse, answers the upgrade line with little to no wait time 24 hrs a day, and even provides on-line chat windows to upgrade or add. When I finally toughed it out I was told that they could only refund 60 days worth of charges per company policy. I waited an excessive amount of time to speak to a supervisor that told me the best he could do was $40 credit on my next bill. Supervisor was Michael at approximately 9:30 pm 6/26/15. Total length of time for call was over 35 minutes. I have also had my service disconnected 1-2 days before the disconnect date indicated on the notice sent in the mail on multiple occasions. Comcast uses its virtual monopoly to suck money out of the pockets of its reluctant customers with unscrupulous business practices.

1973,"I called Comcast the week of April 6, 2015 to make a payment arrangement to have $175.00 removed from my checking account on April 10, 2015. They asked for the routing number and account number for my checking account number. I was told that $175.00 would be removed from checking account on April 10, 2015.
 I started received harassing phone calls about my account, the next day . I called Comcast again and spoke to a supervisor who assured me that a payment arrangement was made and that $175.00 would be removed from my checking account on April 10, 2015. Again, they asked for my routing number and account number for my checking account. The payment due was $53.00 but I wanted to make an additional payment.
 I stopped by my bank on April 13th and there was no payment removed from my checking account. I, again, called Comcast and was told that I only had a payment agreement. There was no binding arrangement for the payment of $175.00. I needed to make a payment ASAP or my services would be shut off on April 16, 2015. I have cable. land line and high speed internet through Comcast.
 I stopped by a Comcast store on 4-13-15 and made a cash payment of $60.00 to avoid cancellation of services. I called Comcast on 4-15-15 to make an additional payment of $175.00. The person I spoke to tried talking me out of making a payment.
 It seems like there's a lot of double talk between agreement and arrangement. I think the language is used to confuse people. I do believe it is a scam because once people's services are shut off, it costs more to have them reconnected.
 Secondly, if this was a non-binding agreement and not a payment arrangement, why were they asking for my routing number and account number? That seems like a breach of confidentiality.
 I appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

1976,"I purchased Comcast Xfinity at a physical store location. After the salesman walked me through several different option, I settled on one that would give me 50 megs, include the Blast! option, and would have limited basic cable. I was quoted a price of around $56-$59 by the salesman after all taxes and fees. I asked him point blank what to expect on my bill, and that was the price he gave me. He broke it down by each line item, and then had me sign the contract. After I received my first bill from Comcast, it was for $93.08 - SIGNIFICANTLY more than what I had agreed to during the in-store visit. The bill include two $15 charges for the self installation kit and the video self installation kit, neither of which were EVER disclosed to me during my visit to the store. The ONLY charge related to the equipment that I was made aware of, and agreed to, was the $10 monthly rental fee for the modem. In addition to the fact that this was a deceptive billing practice (you don't buy a car for an agreed-upon price, only to receive a bill for almost 40% more at a later date), I was not actually able to install the devices myself. It required a technician to be dispatched, which I was ADDITIONALLY charged for. I refuse to pay for the self installation kits that I never agreed to, never signed for, and additionally was unable to use, resulting in significant additional charges. I am disputing the $15 charge for the video self installation kit. A Comcast customer service representative removed one $15 charge for the self installation kit due to the fact that I was not provided with the proper cords for it the first time around, resulting in an ""inconvenience"". However, I never should have been charged for either self installation kit, given those charges were never disclosed to me at the time I signed the service contract.

1977,"When logged into comcast xfinity's online account, my bill reads $0.00, as I have attempted to setup auto pay...this should be normal. Today I received an email threatening to disconnect service if $200 plus was not paid. I have been on hold for over an hour and cannot do anything while logged into there system. I will not pay a bill without an itemized invoice of charges and feel as though I am being penalized. I also requested that the extra ""xfinitywifi"" signal coming from my equipment to be turned off months ago and now see it is still there. So in essence, xfinity is showing that I owe nothing on my account, but threatening to disconnect if I don't pay $200+ without an itemized bill all the while stealing my electricity for there service after I requested it turned off.

1978,"Comcast, I recently moved to new location where comcast did offer service and Comcast hit me with
 two early termination fees of over $1000. They expected the early termination fees immediately.
 They immediately turned me over to collection agency a week after turning in equipment. I have
 received no less than four phone calls a day. I paid $500 last week and told comcast I would pay the
 rest next pay period which was in two weeks. The collection agency claimed I didnt turn in equipment
 which I spent hour on phone with comcast until they figured out that I did in fact turn all the equipment
 in to comcast office. Comcast would not offer a payment plan for the excessive termination fee
 charge. Excessive harrassment over unaware early termination fees with no payment plan offered.
 Told fees on 4/13 would be $600 then charged another termination fee over $500 more. Collection
 agency Southwest rude as all get out! No payment options offered just plain harrassment.

My bill has increased $30 dollars since then and attempting to remove the cable tv service that I have never used will cause my bill to increase even more. If there was any other option besides slow DSL, I would switch in a heartbeat. All comcast has been willing to do is give me $10 off a month for 6 months to compensate for their unfair practices.

We found out we could not do that because the builder had sold the rights exclusively to another provider. Xfinity is charging a termination fee. We want this waived.

1984,"My 2 years contract with Comcast was for $162.70/month for their internet and other services. They were charging me about $203/month. After about 5 months and spending many hours every time on the phone and getting hung up on. I thought the issue was solved. However, they are now charging me in addition to Taxes, Surcharges & Fees another charge they call on the bill ""Other Charges & Credits,"" which the claim is for taxes but cannot explain. According to the contract, such thing does not exist. Only the Taxes, Surcharges & Fees are on page 2 of the contract. I spent hours on the phone and they hung up on me when I asked for a supervisor. I think Comcast is not being fair or honest with customers as I heard from many other customers of theirs. Even the Internet service is too slow. One of my business neighbors complained about slow Internet and they said to her they cannot do anything.

1985,"About a month ago, I called Comcast to remove a continuous $10 charge for Blast because I felt it was unnecessary. The last time I had read about their ""Blast"" service, it said that it only sped up the first very small portion of a download, (25mb if I recall correctly). Thus I felt it was unnecessary, so I wanted to stop paying $10 extra a month for it. Fast forward to almost a week ago, I started noticing my download speeds were almost half of what they were before. I attributed it to bad weather or technical difficulties of some sort. I kept doing speed tests multiple times daily, each time showing me results of 25-29mbps download, 4-6mbps upload speeds. When I started my service with Comcast, I had an introductory deal that gave me a cheaper price for a certain amount of time, (can't recall exactly how long), and after it was over, I would have to pay more for the same service, which was 50mbps download, 10(?)mbps upload. When the deal was over, I went from paying $54.99/mo to $86.95/mo. I was fine with the price increase, I knew it was going to happen, but I wasn't happy with the $10 extra charge. So I called to have it removed, resulting in my future bills being $76.95. After I removed the $10 extra charge, about 2 weeks ago, my internet speed was normal, up until the last week or so. Today I contacted a customer service representative and they told me I was paying for their ""Performance Package"", which is 25mbps download.
 My complaint is the fact that I had no idea my internet speed would be cut in half over a $10 charge, which I actually don't even know is the reason that caused it. I received no email, no call, no notification whatsoever that my internet speed would be dropped so drastically. I feel extremely ripped off and deceived.

 Hello Federal Communication Commission Staff – today we received a copy of the response you referred to (below). It is inaccurate, incomplete and misleading. Christina at Comcast wrote in her July 6 letter: she “informed Mr. that his portion of the cost would be $2,972.00. Mr. declined to proceed with the plant extension.”
 In fact, it has been our goal to have service provided at the same cost as our immediate neighbors – they did not pay a fee or incur costs for a permit for this service, nor should we. Therefore, we state then and now our request is unsatisfied. did NOT decline to proceed.
 We appreciate your continuing attention to this matter. We would welcome a phone call from you and can be reached at: . Further, since we consider this matter unsatisfied do you recommend opening a new complaint or can this current one be re-opened?

1988,"Comcast Data Caps are meant to push power users into getting business class internet which have a $200 setup fee for something you already have. $200 for someone to do nothing is a wonderful job. In my area the internet providers are Comcast and Comcast. It also prevents people from choosing how they want to use the internet my limiting users with a 300Gb data cap. A 300Gb data cap can be hit easy in a week with only 2 people as users. This data cap was intended to get users that do not use that much internet better prices but the set up is made so that users that use a normal or more data are charged. No pricing plans went down Comcast recently had an increase in price.
 Now the actual data usage. What counts? Any data that passes your router and modem. Oh I streamed a movie from my phone locally to my Chromecast that counts. There was 0 internet use. I can do that without an ISP. Also the cap resets whenever they want at the end of the month. Last time May 31st I downloaded 10Gbs after 5pm and magically the usage for the next month has 10Gb on the first day appear. There is more to this daily and with no more variety in ISPs coming into the area leave Comcast to do what they want in the Stockbridge area.
 So in the end not only is the issue the data cap but pricing too. And we do wonder why Comcast year after year is the most hated company in the US.
 Also all of Comcast's newer contracts opt you in to Binding Arbitration. And the opt out is clearly hidden.

1995,"I recently downgraded my service due to speed and quality issues. When I relocated to Stone Mountain it was recommended that I chose Comcast for its quality and speed. I needed only internet but was compelled to choose a bundle as it was cheaper, doesn't add up if you ask me. Anyway, I chose a telephone/internet bundle and paid additional for a boost to a higher speed in part because I have many internet connected devices and reasonably assumed that it would result in shorter access times and possible higher quality of service (less downtime or service interruptions). After 4 months of frequent interruptions in my service coupled with random monitoring of my download speeds that came nowhere near advertised speeds for the enhanced price I was paying I cancelled this option. My basic cost of services is $49, and I paid $12 to get ""enhanced"" service this is a 25% premium, it is aggravating that this did not result in at least an 25% increase in speed or quality of service. The most disturbing part to me is that I suspect that Comcast knew it couldn't deliver the advertised speeds and would have continued to let me pay for a service I was never going to receive! I base this in part because as I was downgrading the CS rep never offered to investigate why my service was performing up to their advertising claims or why I was having interrupts in my service. I will say that I was finally prompted to downgrade when I was in the mist of another service interruption at 10am in the morning.

1997,"Hello,
 My name is
 Address is
 Stoughton MA 02072
 Home phone:
 I lost my husband on September 18,2014 to a sudden heart attack. I have 3 kids, and can’t afford all the bills on my own now because my husband was self employed so I have only 1 income.
 I ordered Comcast /Xfinity TV, Phone, and Internet when I was referred by my sister so I can save money as being a new customer. So I called Comcast spoke to the sales rep, chose a rate that stays the same for 2 years with a 2 year contract which is $89.95 for bundle of 3, $9.95 for each extra TV X 3 TV’s, $10 Modem rental, $9.95 International plan that covers 300 minutes to Lebanon land line and mobile, $12 HD TV, and $10 DVR, also offered me $5 HBO, $5 Cinemax for 6 months rate then they will be $10 each after 6 months so that’s a total of $171.75 plus tax …installation free.
 Ok, I get the installation December 5th…the nightmare began. The rep leaves I have trouble with the TV, and internet service for 2 months. And I work from home…the Installation managers for the area came out with another rep and re-wired the whole house after 2 month with snow being up to their chest in my back yard because they said the installer that came out the 1st time never tested the wires cause that’s the 1st thing they have to do and my wires were original, very old! They apologized and said I would get a credit for 2 months for TV and Internet.
 I get 1st bill I was charged for installation, all international calls, no credit for the referral, showing that my rate changes after the 1st year! Called them and explained to them that the reason I got your service is to save money cause my husband passed away and I couldn’t afford Verizon, and I made sure when I ordered service that the rate doesn’t change for the 1st 2 years and all international calls to Lebanon are covered for 300 minutes cause I had 500 minutes with Verizon for $15 a month etc……The customer service rep had to pull the tape of the recorded conversation with the sales rep that took my order and listen to it with a supervisor and call me back. I got a call back the following week letting me know that they listened to the tape and yes my rate was locked for 2 years, and yes my sister referred me, and yes calls to Lebanon 300 minutes are supposed to be not billed will take care of it and get back to me…..I made 4 calls to follow up and no one would call me back. They said I had to choose a one time credit to offset the $25 extra a month that the rate will go up December 2015 which is $300 a year or they can give me $25 credit starting December 2015 every month when rate goes up. I spoke to rep in the customer resolution team that left a message for supervisor to call me back about the contract issue and I didn’t want a one time $300 credit I wanted $25.00 credit
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 starting December 2015 so rate can stay the same. He also said that he would put a $22 credit for 1 year on my account that will cover DVR and HD service for free for the referral on my account and my sisters account because they couldn’t send out the visa cards for referral because the sales rep didn’t use the correct code when he placed the order. He also opened up a ticket for the international calls credit and for issue to be resolved so calls are not being billed every month. Set up a tech visit that came out and decided will contact installation manager for a resolution about trouble with internet and TV.
 Got another bill with all calls now 2 months worth of international calls still showing up on account. And no manager had called me back about the contract issue to let me know that they will give credit starting December 2015….Customer service rep opened up another ticket for credit for international calls, and left another message for manager to call me back about contract credit…NO call back.
 Called customer service about 10 more time in the following couple weeks all verified yes we see your calls to Lebanon being covered under the carefree international minutes not sure why they are being charged on your bill, finally was transferred to Steve is resolution team at 781-397-1154. He was nice and took all information down and get his supervisor Marcia St. John to call me back, she gave me her number 781-397-1235. She issued $213.00 credit for 2 months of TV and internet problems, also issued a manual credit for international calls for 1st months and opened a ticket to international call dept to have this issue resolved and calls to Lebanon not be charged every month. She called me back twice to let me know that she has a limit of credit that she can apply at once so we would have to split up credit and do it under 3 different days, and the international call dept is working on resolution for my 300 minutes to be deducted for calls to Lebanon from the international carefree minutes. …..She said I should have a 0 balance because I have paid over $250.00 in the past 2 month that would leave me a credit after she applied the $213.00 out of service credit plus all international calls. I got a bill for $339.15 and have left her 7 voicemails; she has not called me back. Spoke to Steven 2 more times letting him know that I got another bill and Marcia is not calling me back, he says I am sorry and I have sent her 2 messages to call you or get back to me. But she hasn’t gotten back to him either. Spoke to Peter a level 4 rep in resolution team that refused to give his last name or phone number. He said will have another supervisor call me back by noon that day which was on 04/02 from his dept and he doesn’t see Lebanon calls being covered under international plan etc…NO CALL BACK…..not sure how this company is still in service.
 I am dealing with the stress and pain of losing my husband, and taking care of 3 kids on my own. AND THIS has been nothing but a nightmare.
 From December 5th until March I should only owe for phone service, which comes up to around $60 max…I got a credit of $213 which should leave a credit $171.00 on my account. NOT have a balance of $339.00 for these international calls that are supposed to be covered in my international plan or else I would have never gotten COMCAST SERVICE if it wasn’t.
 Please resolve this problem for me because I gave up on calling them. They have no respect for their customers. They do not care about their services. Worst company I have ever dealt with.
 I had Verizon for 18 years and I regret leaving them to save money but that was not by choice!!!
 You can contact me by email
 Thank you!!

I just want to enjoy internet service from them but I'm being forced to keep cable because of the unfair pricing policy they have. Also, sometimes their internet connection is very dull and I still pay full amount.

 no show. I have been assured will put your issue on priority & get it resolved every time I spoke to my
 area supervisor. Today on the 22nd day Of no service I am told that "" ma'am I ll push or case forward

2003,"I have been having problems with my Comcast Internet for about 3 weeks now. I have spoken with 2 reps who adv me that their signal is fine. They sent a refresh signal to my modem which temporarily fixed the problem. I am experiencing a very slow connection if any connection at all. I spoke with another representative on Saturday, April 11, 2015. He was very helpful and advised me that there is a weak signal. A technician would have to be dispatched out to correct the issue and also replace the modem. Unfortunately, this will not happen until Thursday. I feel that three weeks is long enough for my family to be without Internet service considering the expensive price tag that comes with Comcast services. I am losing business and my child is unable to complete his school assignments. I am sure that my complaint is one of many but enough is enough. I shouldn't have to wait 5 days for a technician to be dispatched to correct their problem. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

2005,"My husband and I started with Comcast in March of 2015. Ever since we started we have had nothing but problems. Starting with day one, the technician advised us to update our wires to retrieve a better internet connection, which was a waste of money. As soon as the tech left our house the Internet went out. I called every day trying to get someone to come out and fix the Internet. I finally got ahold of someone and was told they would be there the next day, so I left work early and to no surprise no one showed up. I ended up having to go get another modem myself from the local comcast store because I could not get a tech to come out for the life of me. The modem didn't work so I called again, I was able to get a tech out here and his solution was ""I wiggled the wires, hopefully that will help"". Obviously it did not help, so I called yet again. I was repeatedly told that I could not speak to a supervisor and they refused to provide me with corporates number. After a few weeks of calling I was able to get another tech out here, which informed me that my internet had gone out over 275 times in ONE month. Yet, he still could do nothing to help fix the problem. I have lost money and time with this company. I depend on the Internet like many others and have had to resort to taking my laptop to the local grocery store and use their wifi. We have also lost our cable since the last tech was here, which was over a month ago. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. I would be a lot more detailed; however, I am having to use my phone to file this complaint because of course my internet is out once again.

2006,"I terminated service with ComCast (telephone, cable, and internet), and was charged for an early termination fee (after what I was told was the period of the contract when I signed up), and for some equipment they claimed was not returned. The equipment was in fact returned, and later I was credited for the termination fee and the equipment. However, I had asked for a final amount, an itemized bill, and copy of the agreement I allegedly signed with the early termination fee provision. I received none of these. First contact I got with the final billing amount was from Comcast's collection agency. Although I have now paid the outstanding balance to avoid any negative credit reporting as that would affect my employment. However, I have yet to receive an itemized bill. I don't have the telephone number that was attached to the account with me now. The service address was , Sunnyvale, CA 94087, the account ended in 6432.

2007,"Our internet keeps getting disconnected every few minutes making it impossible to do even the basic
 browsing from home on any device wireless / wired. Called comcast today and they say they will not
 send the technician to fix it since they don't see the problem on their end. My neighbor is having
 issues as well and they got the same response. We feel cheated and feel like this company is taking
 advantage of it being the only provider in our neighborhood."
2008,"I initially setup internet service but got lower speed than I expected. It was priced at $29.99. So I
 called to change the speed to 25Mbps and was given a deal for $39.99. They also sent me a cable
 box. But when I got my bill I found that Comcast had charged $67 per month for both internet and
 cable TV(which I did not request). After a 25 min phone call, basically they were unable to resolve it.
 I am still on hold as I write this complaint to you."
2009,"On May 25, 2015 I called Comcast to report about internet connectivity problems I had been facing for almost a month. My original internet plan was performance Internet for which I am charged $66.95 per month. The Comcast representative told me that the problem can be resolved if i get a new modem at no additional cost, He also used the opportunity to tell me that my internet speed can be increased for an additional cost of just $3 and that my new monthly charge will be $69.95 per month for the next 12 months. I asked him if there is any contract period , lock in period or cancellation fees. he said no to all this. He also offered me free cable TV service at no additional cost and that he would send me new modem for internet and a new settop box for cable tv. I agreed thinking my bill would increase by only $3 plus taxes. A few days later i received the new modem and settop box. I fixed them but still had issues with my internet. So I called the customer service again and they tried to help me , but could not resolve my problem. So the agent said she can send a service man to my home to fix the problem. I agreed and the appointment was scheduled. The service man came on May 31st,2015 and fixed the problem.
 On June 9th, I looked into my Bill and I was shocked to see the total amount due of $172.73 payable by 06/27/15. My BP immediately shot up.
 When I looked into the details I found that billing was completely different from what i was told during the sale over phone. Plus it also included $ 70 for residential trouble call ( about which I was not informed when the visit was scheduled) and $15 for Video SIK Install Kit ( I was not about this either). On same day i contacted Comcast and the agent told me that these two fees would be reversed.
 I was greatly affected by this whole incident. What the agent told me about the internet service was not accurate and not truthful. the information given about the pricing and other additional fees was not correct. On the whole the agents made false , misleading and deceptive statement to me. It has caused great anxiety to me and made me feel very stressed up.
 A call to make complaint about my internet service landed me into all this unwanted issues, leading to waste of time as well.

2010,"On Nov of 2014 we relocated our business. On or about November 26th I contacted Comcast to
 request information on their service at our new location. After a salesperson sold us on upgraded
 service etc he informed us he would simply move our service billing to our new address. On or
 around the end of December of 2014 we detected a double billing of our new service and old service
 that was set up on auto payment. We contacted Comcast and was assured that this would be fixed.
 In March WE again notice that this was not fixed and contacted Comcast again for the third time. On
 this date we were given a ref# of CR 450430067 to reflect that disconnection and credit of over
 800.00 of past billings. ON April 6th despite all the above we were again assured a credit would be
 issued and the old account would be disconnected.
 With well over 1000.00 in payments on autobilling being sent we again were told we would receive
 credit and payment back. We were issued a new confirmation number of CR 451071171 to reflect
 disconnection and credit. Unfortunately on May 7th we received yet another bill showing this was not
 disconnected. We contacted Comcast and a Ms. Brown gave us a new number POC -
 8495753801704031 to reflect a credit and again disconnection of the service and stop of billing. On
 May 13th I emailed to insure this was resolved and received no response from Ms Brown's despite
 her assurance and email that this would be resolved on May 7th. As of today we once again
 received another notice of past due and bill charges for this account. I contacted MS Brown again via
 her email provided and received no response. We need help to get this resolved."
2011,"I am paying for 50 Mbps, but seldom get beyond 15 Mbps. The techs have been out 6 or 7 times the last 18 months. My bill just increased nearly $20 a month, so I logged into my comcast account online, and it gave me an option to upgrade my internet only package to 105 Mbps. When checking out, It bumped me to sales chat. During the 90 minutes I was in chat, I was transferred to 5 different ""analysts"" who who each gave me very different requirements, as well as 4 different prices for the 105 Mbps package. So in short, with each person I chatted with, the price went from the advertised upgrade price of $24.99 for 12 months, then to $54, then $66, then to $114 per month. None of the information they provided to me was what was clearly stated on the Comcast website. In addition, I have been paying for 50 Mbps for the last 2 years, and according to speedtest.net, have been averaging around 13 Mbps. Unfortunately, I live in a rural area, and comcast is the only service provider available. I only have internet with comcast.

2014,"I feel the Comcast data limit is unfair. As Comcast only has set data limits in a few markets - listed below. This ""test"" is unfairly charging a subset of their customers for the same products offered nationwide. Since Telecommunications is essentially a targeted monopoly, in that i have 1 choice and one choice only for cable services in my area, this is extremely unfair!!!!! I can't see how and why the FCC is letting comcast get away with this ""TEST"". This is akin to the baggage fees the airline charges. It started with one and now EVERY Airline charges. Please do something to stop this unfair practice.

I would like to bring Comcast up as a company that does the same thing with a user's home internet access. It's been proven that Comcast throttles your home internet services when you hit a certain uage limit and also at separate times of the day.
 For someone who uses Comcast services for mainly internet streaming of movies (Netflix), music, and childrens television, I am impacted on a constant basis. It doesn't have to do with my location either. We live in a small town in eastern PA.
 I hope you can help.

2018,"I currently live in Carroll County where there are no other high speed internet options. I believe that Comcast has engaged in predatory monopolistic pricing with regard to their internet service. In the time that I have had Comcast my service has nearly doubled in price, from $40 to now nearly $80. Repeatedly I have tried to negotiate a more competitive rate with Comcast. In the past I have taken on cable TV service in a bundled package to lower my overall monthly cost. I'm still not sure on the merits of agreeing to take on extra services to reduce my overall bill. That sure seems like subtraction by addition.
 Since I do not have any comparison points where I live. I've attempted to look at costs in other areas where Comcast has competition and it appears that they are rather deceptive on their website in sharing comparable pricing in other locations. I simply could not find the pricing anywhere on comcast.com. All I can find are promotional offers for a faster Blast plan at $54.95 versus what I currently pay, which is $78.95. I would gladly take an offer but trying to talk with the service reps on your 800 number is at best an exercise in frustration. In the past, I routinely have been hung up on, transferred or just plain put on hold endlessly.
 I would love to see some changes here in my area. The constant price increases with no competition is simply not sustainable.
 Thanks.

2022,"I have been disputing a paid bill for about three years that has been sent to collections. It was paid and equipment returned October 2011 at a local store in Tacoma, Washington. Since that time, I have been disputing the collections claim. I recently called to dispute again because it still shows on my credit report. I was told that I somehow filed for bankruptcy and they gave me the claim number as well as the attorney. After contacting the attorney, I have found the names do not match up. They have mixed up my identity with somebody else as well as caused mistaken billing statements in my name. They simply have the wrong person, but are going after me and are not willing to work with me.

2023,"For a long time, my speeds have gone down. When we first signed a contract, I was hitting 50 to event 60 mbps if I was plugged directly into the modem, but now (and after canceling the cable portion of our contract), my internet speeds crawl constantly, sometimes to the point that working becomes impossible. It's very unstable, and will jump from less than 1 mbps to maybe 7, but then go back down (as can be seen by the attachment, speeds taken over the course of 10 or so minutes while standing within 5 feet of the router). I had also power cycled the modem, so that wasn't the issue. It's also an updated modem that will handle the latest speeds from Comcast. I live in an apartment, so I know there can be issue, but the fact is at one point I WAS receiving the speed I'm paying for, but now I'm not (and I haven't for quite some time).

2024,"We have had xfinity cable and Internet since March 2015. Our internet is said to be high speed and have good wifi. We have had several issues with connection and our laptop is actually slower when connected to this wifi. We only connect our phones and one laptop and it is never at the same time. The internet randomly goes out for hours for no apparent reason and all Comcast has told us is to unplug or run a speed test. We are paying ridiculous amounts for something we can hardly use. I have full time school and so I need reliable service. So I scheduled an appointment for a technician to come out today, and he was a no show. We didn't get any notice of cancellation, change of time, or anything. I feel like we are getting ripped off.

 Hello there---
 After many days the rep finally contacted me and is basically offering no resolution. Meanwhile I receive a letter saying that the service will be suspended on 04/16. This is very critical for me since my husband does most of his work using the Internet...
 Of course worst customer service ever... I requested that she listens to the phone conversation that justifies what I am saying but they keep giving me the run around... Please help me, I can't deal with them anymore..... They executive customer service rep takes forever to return my call !!!!!

2026,"I initiated my account with Comcast in October of 2014. As soon as I received my first bill I had to call and address issues of charges that were not supposed to be on there. This went on for several months until January, 2015. At that time I received paperwork stating that I was past due. I was distracted and angry and paid the bill without thinking. Later that day I realized that the bill was incorrect. I called and spoke with a representative and was advised that I had indeed been over billed for past charges that were incorrect. I was advised that I was now paid up for the next cycle and would even have a credit of $5.00 or so on the bill after that. On 04/13/15 I received a new notice saying I was going to be disconnected for past due charges. Upon calling I was advised that I was improperly billed the first two months (they stated that I was not actually charged for my internet at all) and that I was now being charged accordingly. I was also told that there had been increases in both the cost of the router and my service. This is contrary to what I signed up for in October for a 12 month agreement. After complaining I was told the best they could do was a $30.00 credit. They have literally changed the fees and cost of my service and are now telling me that I can do nothing about it. I was subsequently told that I was being charged a late fee as well. When I stated that I have received no bill I was told by the representative that I had previously signed up for ebilling. I never asked for or signed up for paperless billing and have received no such bill.

2027,"We changed our package (internet, cable and phone) with Comcast on 4/25 which was to be effective 5/7 at our next billing period. They sent us a confirmation of the new plan plus charges, however, the charges are $30 more than we were quoted by phone. I called Comcast again on 4/26 and was told that these are not correct charges and we would receive another confirmation with a correction. We have not received this confirmation to date (4/28). Plus our statement which can be viewed online is still incorrect. My major complaint is that today when I called again to attempt to rectify the situation my call was dropped after spending a lengthy amount of time plowing through their call tree. Then when I call back I get a message that says the call cannot go through. This is just one example of the poor service as well customer service this company provides. Any assistance you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.

2028,"Had service for a month and a half. In the past 2 weeks, my internet service has gone from fast and
 working great to intermittent every single day. Every day gets worse. Call into Comcast 3 times about
 this. Rep want to send a rep to fix the issue but I have to pay for it. i refused since I am already
 paying Comcast $81 a month for service. My router, modem, tv, and dvd player are all new. The tech
 used new cables during the installation yet the default answer I keep getting is it must be my
 equipment. I know its not because everything has been working a month before I moved when I was
 with Bright house and a month after I moved and started service with Comcast. I had 15 mbps with
 Bright house and have faster internet connection than the 50 mbps I pay for with Comcast. What
 gives?"

 Circle N E, Tallahassee, Florida, 32308, has had 6 days of outages lasting from 2to 3 hours each. I
 have talked to Shaun Johnson, who is supposed to be in charge. Many other businesses are also
 affected by what a tech says is a break in the line. This affects our phones, Internet access & ability to
 get into our cloud based program. It is killing our business. I am at the beach now dodo not have

2031,"I am totally frustrated with Comcast to say the least, I spent more than 3 hours to resolve the issue of Internet not working, I started by calling the xfinity toll free number, I called more than 10 times because everytime I called and was getting ready to be transferred, the call disconnects, and prior to this, there's another problem with getting through in the first place, it tells me whenever I dialed the number that Comcast isn't taking calls from my my area, I have to dial multiple times to get through, after the inability to reach someoe via telephone, I turned to the Internet chat session, the first person that I spoke with was called Nicole, she tried unsuccessfully to do a hard reset and gave me a number to call and speak to a technician, I dialed the number and got the same response, ""disconnects"" whenever I get ready to be transfered, so I turned back to the Internet chat session, I must have signed in more than 5 times trying to reach an agent but this people are so impatient that they don't even wait for you to finish typing before they end your session claiming you didn't respond, am like, I certainly need more than 15 seconds to type, and it informs me she they are typing, isn't it supposed to be vice versa, when I finally reached someone, I was literally crying, the guy helped but I had to go to the modem and provide numbers, leaving my two year old toddler to do this caused me some disaster, by the time I came back to the room, papers and books were every where, am also pregnant and had to bend down to provide the needed info for the representative Kristoffer, it was awful, needless to say and I felt like I needed a live person to speak to as supposed to consistently typing, and watching a toddler, am preparing for a major exam and 3 hours of my day could have gone towards studying other than dealing with Comcast mess, it's a shame they have a monopoly in my town. All through this, not one person informed me, they were having technical issues on the toll free number, it made me feel like I was being singled out and my calls were rejected deliberately.

2032,"I recently moved and brought Comcast internet/tv to my new home. They sent a ""required"" $9.99 self installation package even though I have my own cable modem. I was informed that if I installed the equipment they provided or left it in the box I would be charged for renting their provided modem. I had to then ship everything back to Comcast since their office is on the other side of town from where I work and live.
 Another issue I have is that they require TV service to reduce your internet bill. We do no use the TV but have to rent their boxes to receive a lower internet bill. No other service offers internet at my address.

2033,"My Comcast bill is really high due to the fact that they don't have any competition in the Tallahassee Area. We are forced to have a higher internet rate due to the lack of broadband service as defined by the FCC. The bill creeps up higher and higher each year with no appreciable quality of service increase. If there was any broadband competition I would love to be able to switch but simply have no recourse. Comcast also is using my electricity to have a wifi hotspot in my house without me being compensated for the use of my electricity. I was forced to upgrade my modem and it came with a hotspot. I was not given the option to opt out. I expressly told the person on the phone I did not want the hotspot option on my modem.

2034,"I executed a small business contract with Comcast on 2/20/12 for internet and phone service. I fulfilled the 36 month service agreement and called today to cancel the internet service, but learned they would not agreed to end the contract until 60 days had elapsed. That is ridiculous. I expect to pay for services I received and a reasonable amount of time for a disconnect, but no other company has that clause that i'm aware of. In addition, while the customer service rep said it is written in a clause attached to a hyperlink attached to the contract my office manager executed, I still cannot find that clause. Comcast is committing a scam and I believe the FCCC should intervene.

2035,"I have been a Comcast customer for 2 years, although I have been using their service for much longer though other households (roommates and relatives). Initially when I signed up, I received an introductory discount and eventually increased after the first 12 months to over double what I had originally signed up for. Each 6 months after that, there seemed to be a new increase. I only use internet and never turn on the cable box. I was forced to sign up for a bundled package because the cost of internet is more alone than in combination with tv. If I wanted the same internet speed by itself that I am receiving now, it would be DOUBLE the price. I even started losing tv channels that I had previously been receiving. One of which was all of the ESPN channels. Like I said, I rarely use my cable box, but subscription to those services use to provide internet streaming as well. Without warning, Comcast removed these services.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 The only way I have been able to keep my bill lower is to call every few month and threaten canceling my service. I am immediately transferred to their retention department and offered the same price I was receiving before. This is very deceiving billing practice that preys on unsuspecting customers. If I try to change my service myself online, I am automatically forced to add a modem rental even though I have my own modem.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

2036,"I am paying comcast for one of the fastest internet speeds it has. Yet my internet is still as slow, if not slower, than my neighbor's internet who has only the medium range to slower speed. I pay for the faster internet and feel that I'm getting sidelined by comcast with these slower speeds. I feel like this is a response to my recent downgrading of service since I recently dropped television because they were overbilling me; it seems that way because my drop in speed has only begun recently (since my dropping of television) and I'm the only one in the house now. It is unfair.

2037,"I have called Comcast several times over the past 6 months in regards to my internet connection
 issues. I have spent countless hours on the phone and online with tech support to resolve. I have
 asked for several appointments to have my outside lines checked in which no one has showed up. I
 paid a computer IT professional to come to repair my issues but has shown that the issue is directed
 back to Comcast. I have been paying for service that is beyond poor and when I called to cancel my
 service since the price was continuously going up they reduced my rate by locking me into a 2 year
 contract and since then my internet service has been extremely slow. I have exhausted all my options
 other than to file a formal complaint against Comcast for their poor customer service skills and
 inability to resolve my issues. I use my home for business purposes and I can not cancel my internet
 service since now they have contactually locked me into keeping their beyond poor services."

So we rescheduled ( couldn't get anyone until the 24the) finally05-24-15 I got services. 06-14-15 I logged on to see when my bill would be due and check the total amount. $131 ( my bill is supposed to be39.99) . I called Comcast to make a complaint. After arguing with a rep they finally agreed not to charge me for the 10 days I did not have service. But they will not adjust date the account was created. Because of this I had to pay $30for the few days I did have service and 39.99 in less then a week. I don't think it's fair to have to come up with 2 payments in one month because of their mess up.

2040,"It has been about 1 1/2 months since I filed my complaint. Shortly after filing my complaint I received
 a call from Comcast Corporate in reference to my complaint and was quickly referred to the tech
 department that deals with line issues. This is what I had been trying to get addressed for over eight
 months with the constant statement of ""We have to come check the house and have the complaint
 escalated to that group because we have no way to contact them"". So I was elated to finally have this
 addressed after all this time.
 A crew of 2 people came to the house and check the house and the line at the pole. They told my
 wife that everything inside the house was working perfectly. They stated they could definitely tell there
 was a problem and that it was somewhere between the pole at the street and the beginning source of
 the line. They said they would continue to work on the issue but they should be able to access
 everything without needing to come back into the fenced yard. We assumed that we would finally get
 our service repaired after having issues ever since we moved into the house in July of 2013.
 I received a call a couple of weeks later and was asked to record some more shows with the ongoing
 issues. I attempted to get credited for services as they are still not working and am now getting
 refusals for credit because I have received credits in the past. When I demanded the credit for the
 lack of services I was told that I would need to go to an office location if I wanted any further credit
 before the service was fixed. I was told at the Olympia office that I would have to wait until the service
 was restored before I could receive correct amount of credit but they would place a hold on my
 account so that my services would not be shut off. Today my services were shut off. When I called
 and demanded they be restored and told them of everything that has been happening I was told that I
 received a credit a short time ago and that I was no longer illegible for further credits because I had
 been given a credit from corporate.
 I have been saying since early last year that I no longer feel comfortable paying for my services when
 I am not receiving them. I have been refusing to pay for them since late last year hoping that this
 would cause the corporate office to take notice and fix my service.
 I have developed a severe lack of confidence that my service will ever be repaired. This makes me
 feel very strong about not waiting until my services are fixed before paying for them. I was forced
 today to pay nearly $300 to have my services restored so that I can continue to receive VERY poor
 service both with internet and cable television. If I must continue to wait for my service to be restored
 then I have just wasted $300 with another $135 bill due.
 I am in a rural area and have no other options for internet and am forced to stay with Comcast or not
 have internet. I am in desperate need of assistance in getting some action in this matter. I am very
 stressed out over this matter and feel I will never get it resolved without some sort of outside help.
 Sincerely"

Comcast did not disclose there was a charge for the visit and led me to believe it was part of their customer service. When I called Comcast to dispute the charge their solution was I sign up for their service agreement at $4.99 a month which would give me unlimited access to technician visits.

2050,"Dear Sir or Ma'am,
 Since Comcast began it's ""market test"" in my area nearly a year ago, my internet bill has doubled. I use online services like Netflix to watch HD movies and television shows. I use onlines services like Steam for my games and thus download them when I want to play them. The 300GB of data policy Comcast is ""testing"" with my service is not nearly enough. I can easily double that in a month.
 This isn't a market test. This is a telephone/cable/internet company trying wring every last cent out of it's customers because it can't adapt to a changing market. Only a few of my friends still get cable service and none have a landline telephone number, so Comcast is trying to make up for it through bogus bandwidth policies.
 Please dismantle the monopolies companies like Comcast have and regulate ISP's like like you did with the telephone industry.
 Thank you,

2051,"I turned in Comcast equipment (modem and router with wires) and was told in person that I would get a credit automatically on my bill and I didn't have to do anything. I was told by phone they could see a credit but then when it came time for them to bill for my next billing cycle they issued me a regular bill with no credits and no mention on the bill of turning in any of their equipment. I kept the receipt to prove I did turn in their equipment. I bought my own modem to keep from having to pay them the $10 a month fee. Then they have the nerve to keep billing me as usual. The modem fee should be gone since I turned it in. I guess they expect me to go down to their office and make a separate trip to get my credit but like I was told I should not have to do that. The rep logged in both items that I turned in and showed me in her computer that it was there.

2055,"I have been a Comcast customer since November of 2013. I think my first payment may have been late due to confusion about the process/timeline, but after that, I have always paid on time – if not early. I cancelled auto-pay in March (AFTER paying my bill), because I knew I was going to be moving and was not sure where I would be moving to/ if Comcast would be available at my next residence. Once it was determined I would be living in the same building but in a different unit, I arranged for a transfer of services. I was very pleased with the level of customer service I received throughout the whole process. Everyone I talked to during that time was beyond helpful and knowledgable.
 I re-started auto pay shortly after my move, in April. I have confirmed with my credit union that Comcast’s most recent automatic deduction from my bank account was April 11th, 2015.
 My service was interrupted on May 26th. I initially thought I was just having connectivity issues, which I often do. However, when I went to check for outages online using my phone’s data, the Comcast website informed me that I was past due. I knew that this was not possible since I am on auto-pay and had plenty of money in my checking account. I was given the option to make a payment online, so I figured I would just pay whatever the system thought I owed and dispute it later. But when I went to make a payment online, it said I owed $0. I then called Comcast and since the offices were closed, I used the automatic system which told me I owed around $192. I paid that by credit card and the recording said my services would be restored within 30 minutes. They were not.
 The next morning, my internet still was not working. I was very annoyed that I was supposedly past due when I am on auto-pay, and annoyed that my service had not been restored as promised. I called Comcast again. The recording at the beginning of the call said my account was suspended until I paid a balance of –I believe--$63.50. I was not sure what this charge was from, since I had paid the entire balance the night before. The representative I spoke with really did not seem to be able to tell me much; she transferred me to the cancellation department, because I was no longer interested in being a Comcast subscriber. There I spoke with a gentleman named Joshua, who was more helpful; he said that he would have to transfer me to collections so that they could remove the hold on my account. The representative in that department was helpful and spent some time working on the issue. She said it should be restored in about 90 minutes, and I asked to be transferred to make a customer service complaint. There, I spoke with a representative named Brian. Brian was not much help; I explained the situation to him but he did not seem to understand my frustration. Brian said it was my responsibility to make sure the bill is paid; he did not seem to understand that I always pay the bill, and that I was on auto-pay so by all appearances it would seem that it was Comcast’s error to not charge me. I wanted assurance that if I were to put my information in again, this would not happen again. I don’t want to assume that AUTOMATIC payment is happening AUTOMATICALLY
 and then find out it hasn’t been. He could not provide any reason as to why this happened; instead he seemed to think I simply didn’t pay the bill. He also said there was no autopay information on file for me. However, when I logged into Comcast today, it appears that I am set up for automatic payment (see attached screenshot) and I did confirm this with my bank. He mentioned something about a hard disconnect, and that being why they were having such a hard time reconnecting me. I asked why there would be a hard disconnect (once he explained what that was) for one allegedly past due payment. That seems drastic, especially considering I was never notified of any issues with my account.
 I was told I would get a call within 72 hours to deal with my complaint; that was almost 2 weeks ago, and I have not heard anything. I called Comcast again yesterday and was told they ""do not have a complaint department"". Not only do I find that difficult to believe--a large corporation not having a complaint department seems highly unusual to me--but I was told different during my last interaction with Comcast.
 I have spent at least 3 hours on the phone with Comcast in the last few weeks; my service was interrupted when it shouldn't have been, and took about 36 hours to fully restore. No steps have been taken to remedy this situation, and whenever I talk to Comcast they tell me they have no billing information on file for me, yet when I log in to my account, i see otherwise. Additionally, my bill has gone up $30 with no explanation.
 I have never received such terrible and unethical service from a company before. I am truly shocked by how unscrupulous this company is and will be changing to another provider as soon as possible. However, I do not want Comcast to continue to behave this way, especially if a customer is not able to choose another company--like I wasn't when I first became a customer.

 Please note that I have not received any correspondence from Comcast; I haven't been contacted by email, or at the phone number that is in this complaint/that I have set as the primary contact for my account. It also appears that they have incorrect address information on my account, when they know I moved because they transferred services to the new address. I have also attached more documents regarding the inconsistent information I get from Comcast. During my last call with them, they said my bill is due around the 20th or 21st. This is a change from what has always been the due date (the 8th or 9th), and this is also inconsistent with what my account says online.

2056,"Poor Internet service, paying for over 30mbps connection, but cannot even use Internet when I'm in the same room as the router or when using a wired connection."
2057,"Comcast has instituted monthly bandwidth caps with charges for exceeding those caps however they
 are unable to reasonably or consistently meter usage. The methodology they use for measuring
 bandwidth consumption is highly inaccurate with a very high standard of deviation. It's unfair that
 customers are being held financially accountable to a metric that Comcast cannot maintain within a
 narrow margin of accuracy.
 I use a device on my network edge (the point where my home network meet's Comcast's network) to
 measure my bandwidth consumption and Comcast's monthly measurements vary anywhere from 1.5-
 9% from my own measurements. For comparison, other utilities that meter usage typically have a 2-
 3% accuracy.
 Unlike other utilities, whose meters are measuring analog units and whose meters can be impacted
 by external forces, Comcast is measuring a digital unit with absolute precision without interference.
 Additionally data traversing their network is directly tied to a particular client so they can measure it at
 multiple points along their network so they can easily self check. Accuracy should be attainable
 without any variance."
2058,"We recently signed up with Comcast for our TV, internet, and phone service on 3/31/2015 and were told before signing up that there is no data capping or throttling with the plan we were going to get. 18 days later we started receiving popups on our web browser saying we have hit 90% of our data for the month. At first I didn't understand what was going on. I was told we had unlimited and there was no throttling. Come to find out after many phone calls to Comcast over this issue, Tucson AZ is a test area for them and there is a 350gb cap on all internet here. Well that wouldn't be so bad, I can always go to a competitor for service with what i wanted. Or so you would think. After spending most of a day on the phone with other companies not a single one of them offers internet service in this area of Tucson and we are forced to either keep Comcast or not have internet at all. When originally singing a two year contract with them we were lied to and brought into Comcast under false pretenses that we had unlimited data usage. I'm not sure how Comcast has done it but I have a hunch they may have some deal with the city that they can be the only provider in this area, but like I said I'm not entirely sure on this because I don't know the full extent of the law for it. This along with the severe lack of competition in this area is borderline disgusting.

2061,"Hi,
 Currently my Internet provider is running a test market in my area where they charge extra once a certain bandwidth has been reached. This number is rather ambiguous and probably picked out to net them the most profit. How are they able to run their service as a utility when there is no Government regulation?
 It virtually costs them near to nothing to provide any data to their customers (nearly $.01 / GB), and yet they have a 2000% markup. Further, they also claim using more data congests the line, which is completely untrue and used as an excuse to earn them more money.
 Given there are literally no other options for me, I am forced to deal with this idiocy. Why must I pay for a service, but be limited for use of a service promised at a specific speed? Seems pretty ridiculous. Additionally, I called their support line and they insured me I would be able to remove the charges from my bill, months prior to my usage. However, when it came time to resolve issues with my bill, the story had changed and it left me with nearly $200 in fees that were ""guaranteed"" to be recuperated.
 Please help me out here, I can't stand having to deal with this nonsense.
 Thank you.

2062,"My bill has recently increased by 45%. I called today and spoke to a woman on the phone who was
 able to get me a new bundle. She told me everything would be the same as I had. I was told $89.99
 for the same package I had. That included 50mbps internet. After I agreed to all of this, my internet
 went out. I had to call again to have it reset. I then learned that my internet speed was now lowered to
 25mbps. I have spoken to 8 different people regarding this issue. It turns out that Tucson AZ is one of
 few places the speeds and names aren't the same as everywhere else. Everyone along the way
 offered to upgrade me to 50mbps for an additional $5 per month. I should not have to pay for
 something I was told would be included in my deal. I spoke to a gentlemen who was extremely helpful
 and informed me of this weirdness with Arizona. He transferred me to customer loyalty where I spoke
 to the most rude person I have ever talked to in my entire life. I explained the situation and he
 basically told me there was nothing I can do. He said I can either take the deal or have my service
 disconnected.
 The terms I verbally agreed to over the phone was the same internet I had before. Now they want to
 charge me $5 more per month because an employee doesn't know what they are doing."
2063,"Comcast is charging an extra 10 ten dollars if you exceed your data cap. These data caps are
 arbitrary and are simply there to overcharge the customers who already overpay for internet."
2064,Comcast has imposed an arbitrary data cap on us. And is charging us.
2065,"For approximately a decade we have paid a premium to Comcast for a bundled service that includes
 unlimited internet (Approx. $300 per month). We chose that service and have paid that premium for
 the unlimited internet becuase of services we use including work from home, school research, Netflix
 and Amazon. We have recently become aware - by automated phone messages we receive from
 Comcast - that we have exceeded our limit of 300 GB per month. These messages began in the
 past few months. So I spoke to three Comcast representatives (with my spouse on speaker phone)
 about what the term ""Unlimited"" means. I was told that a new policy was instituted in December 2013
 whereby a consumer was limited to 300GB per month and after that they were to be charged $10 per
 every 50GB over 300GB used per month. For our bill this month we were charged an extra $50. I
 was told that ""Unlimited"" means that ""after 300 GB we don't cut you off "" by ""Chris"" ID #
 CSATECH797 and ""Chanel"" ID #09?. I was also told that prior to this new policy (i.e.; December
 2013)- without ever notifying us - that when we went over 300GB they would purposefully slow our
 internet connection. We never receieved written notice or agreed to this new Comcast pricing and
 unbundling of our internet. Our bill each month still lists all services as ""HD Premiere XF Bundle""
 priced at $224.95 and the list of services ends with the word ""Unlimited."" (1) Fraud - the slowdown of
 our services prior to 12/2013 consitutes fraud or deceptive practices. (2) Monopoly: The agreement
 that we have with Comcast is an attempt to monopolize the entertainment arena so that we use the
 Xfinity on-demand services rather than Netflix or Amazon. (3) Bait and Switch: We agreed to and
 have paid a premium for ""unlimited"" (as that word is commonly understood) internet acccess and now
 Comcast is attempting a bait and switch by unbundling our bundled pricing.
 My family respectfully asks that the FCC investigate this claim or Fraud, Monopolization, ""Bait and
 Switch"" and Lack of Transparency. Given that Comcast has told us we are a test market we feel that
 if we do not complain, then Comcast will attempt to swindle consumers who do not have the
 advantage of the legal education that I and my spouse have, including the elderly and the disabled."
2066,"Consumer has telephone, internet and TV service with Comcast; last week he had a door to door
 salesman, Jeremy, inquiring if he had any problems with his service. The consumer explained that his
 box was old and he wasn’t receiving all of his channels. He was told that he would receive a new box
 and more channels that would actually reduce his bill to $175. Instead he was notified by e-mail that
 he would be receiving XFinity with a security service. He called the individual; Jeremy stated it was a
 mistake, to ignore the e-mail but the security equipment arrived. His bill was to be $175/month but
 when he called in was told that his bill increased to $220/month. They will not pick up his equipment.
 He has called into customer service repeatedly but they will not assist, they will not return e-mails or
 phone calls. Consumer’s landline number for this account is 520-760-8415. As a resolution, the
 consumer wants Comcast to pick up their additional equipment, for his service to return to the plan he
 had previously and to not be charged for services he did not request. ***CTR367-phone***"
2067,"I live in one of the ""test markets"" where Comcast has imposed a data cap. First, that was never part of the agreement we signed up for with them. Second, their data usage meter doesn't function, neither on the website or their seperate app. So each month, I stand to incur overages yet I can't self-monitor my usage. I also have serious doubts about the accuracy of their meter since it says I am exceeding 350GB/month which seems impossibly high for a two user household to do.

 This is the 2nd complaint I've had to make about Comcast. They have capped my data usage at 350GB, even though there was no cap in my original agreement. Exacerbating that problem, the data meter I have to use to monitor my use doesn't work, neither on the website, nor the stand-alone app. I have talked to an agent 5 times with no attempt at resolution. I filed a FCC complaint already about this problem, and they responded by fixing the meter. It only stayed working 4 days, and I also noticed they lowered my cap another 50GB to 300 immediately after the complaint. I can't say for sure that it's related, but it feels like retribution. Please help."
2068,"I was surprised to discover only two days ago, by a phone call from Comcast, that I had reached 90% of my internet usage cap. I knew nothing about such a cap when signing up for the service. I recently moved to Tucson AZ from Utah where there wasn't a cap. Now I have already surpassed my total usage limit. This will continue to happen each month and I will be forced to pay overage charges or upgrade my service to speeds and bundles that I will not use and definitely do not want. What I need is the removal of this arbitrary and ridiculous data cap.

2070,"We began service in Tucson last April 2014 with Comcast when we moved here from Portland OR. Our pricing was $39.99/month for 50 Mb service, same as in Portland. However, Comcast has slowly jacked the price up to $78.95/month and won't consider lowering it unless I also buy additional services (IP phone, TV, etc.), which I neither need nor want. Obviously the price it is willing to offer is not based on the service but on its desire to maximize profit at consumer expense. Compounding the problem, Comcast has recently also placed - without our consent or advance notice - a data cap on our service so that if we exceed 3.5 Gb/month we get incur substantial extra charges. We never had this in Portland or here in Tucson until the last couple of months. Again, we never agreed to this. As a direct result, we are now afraid to use our internet. Things like Netflix, to which we subscribe, Apple TV, or on demand services through our satellite TV service, which require use of the internet to download a show, now loom like threats rather than additional entertainment options. Comcast says it will warn us if we approach the limit, but this is not the service we signed up for. We don't want to live in fear of an excess charge or be worried that we are reaching the limit. Making matters worse, Comcast's service in our area is terrible in the evenings. Almost every evening we run into unbearably slow internet speeds, and frequently nothing will load at all. The only time it provides consistent, high speed service is the daytime, when neither of us is regularly home. With pricing now doubled and service worse than ever, we wonder why Comcast is allowed to charge what it does. The 50 Mb service is nowhere near what it advertises for our home.

2072,"I recently moved to Tucson, AZ and Comcast is my current ISP, not by choice, rather there is no other viable high speed internet provider offering comparable service in my area. As you may or may not know, Tucson is one of the trial cities where Comcast has implemented Data Caps on it's internet subscribers. I pay for 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload bandwidth service. This tier is given a monthly allowance of 350 GB per month, after which a $10 dollar fee accompanies each additional 50 GB. My girlfriend and I utilize the internet that we have paid for for Video streaming, online gaming, and internet browsing and are finding that we will be easily surpassing out monthly allotment and the following shows why. The average HD Netflix stream consumes around 3 GB per their FAQ on their website. Lets assume we watch two, two hour movies each night after work. That comes out to 360 GB each month JUST for Netflix, let alone other internet usage. God forbid I need to stream video for work or want to download a computer game. The later of which can consume 40-55 GB, let alone the data required to actually play the game online. As you can see, even moderate users can easily surpass these data caps while utilizing fractions of the internet speed that they paid for.
 I am very pleased with the recent reclassification of High Speed Internet as a Title II common carrier, however, I think my situation is one of many examples of why further legislation is required to eliminate data caps which solely serve to create a means for ISPs to ""double dip"" against users whom utilize the service for which they have already paid. This anti-consumer behavior must be addressed in Tucson as well as in the other markets which ISPs are utilizing this exploitative tactic. Our activities on the internet continue to consume larger and larger amounts of bandwidth. Use of these data caps hinders technological progress, competition, innovation, and economic growth. Consumers and businesses alike across the country depend rely on the internet so intervention is necessary for the future of our internet, communities, and economy.
 Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

2073,"We have suddenly hit a data usage cap after having comcast for x number of years. There was no warning of new caps, if this was a thing, and this is the first time we've ever been notified we've been at or near cap. We got our warning with 10GB remaining. A day later we are just up to over 350GB usage. I watched the newest shitty transformers movies on netflix, played my mmo for 3 hours and surfed the same 3 shitty webpages I always surf. My daughter skypes and plays sims three for the summer. My wife updated her Gotham game on PS4. 300GB is absurdly low with how much the internet is part of our(America's) daily culture. To top it off, my X1 platform never works, so even if I wanted to choose from their dated and limited choices I can't because the movie won't load. I used netflix instead. Comcast's sub par services push me away and then penalizes me for it. Awesome. Thanks Comcast.

2076,"The idea of a data cap on wifi usage is awful. We live in a world where everything is online. Most homes have many devices connected at once. But Comcast decides to limit our use by implementing a cap for usage. It's all a scam to penalize its customers so that they can get more money. A data cap should not be applied to wifi. So now we have to limit what we can do on Apple TV and all other wifi connected devices. This is completely unacceptable. Even the DirecTV is connected to the Internet. This is a usage based cap and Comcast is resorting to usage based pricing. This should not be allowed. Comcast is taking advantage of their customers. I wonder if the CEO of Comcast has the same type of usage restrictions.

2082,"I signed a 3 year contract with Comcast business to provide internet service for 36 months. This included internet connection (99.95) , modem fee (7.00) and static IP (14.95). Total amount of signed 36 month contract was 121.90 Comcast has changed fee multiple times during this contract and when I questioned them they said the agreement only covered internet connection the contract states they will not raise internet rates during the contract period and they could effectively raise any other fees at will with no limit and still hold me to a 36 month contract. I am almost done with my 36 month contract and wanted clarification as to how they can do this? It just doesn't seem right they can lock me into a contract for 121.90 a month and then arbitrarily raise fees on modem rental and static IP fees. They don't support bringing your own modem if you have a static IP (which I need for work) so I have to rent a modem from them.

 billing and bad customer service issues. Now to my frustration, first signing up again I have to deal
 with it again. Comcast CS reps really need to do their jobs and management needs to make sure
 these things don't happen. And their only solution is to credit my account for next month billing. Why
 not just take it off now so I don't have to pay this extra charge that I wasn't supposed to anyways"
2085,"I have been a Comcast internet customer for less than a year. However one of the major problems of the service is data caps. I currently get only 300gb of service a month and get fined every time i go over. I go over my internet cap every single month and there is no relief for the numerous overage charges im forced to pay for in order to continue using the internet. Im apart of a household of 3. Im a recent graduate and most of my time is either spent looking for a job, surfing the internet or streaming media. The fact that every month i have to choose which is most important in order to keep from hitting the cap is ridiculous. I shouldnt have to curtail my usage because of a data cap. Paying an extra $10 every time is burdensome and unfair. The FCC should stop companies from setting these caps.

2088,"The ""internet issues"" I have are more than just billing. The description below includes concerns about billing, availability, privacy, as well as several others not listed in your deep down menu.
 My bill for my Comcast internet keeps going up (since being a loyal customer for 2.5 years means nothing over gaining new customers at discounted rates) and I have no reasonable option to switch to. Verizon FiOS and AT&T UVerse are not available in my area and DSL choices leave me paying more for 1/10 the speed. And since there are no other cable internet providers in my area I can find, and switch I make leads to me having to buy me equipment. Comcast's customer service is absolutely horrific and in the event of service outages, it takes nearly a week to get a resolution. In the times I've had a technician come to check an issue, they've told me that my equipment was the issue, causing a huge out of pocket expense, when the entire problem was a severed wire outside of my home and not on my property. Billing issues took months to resolve, and they even performed an unauthorized credit check and added a deposit for equipment I never received. More recently, they sent me an email stating I could now watch TV shows on my home network without having to sign in, which led me to believe they are storing my private network information on their servers. When given the option to put a pin on the TV streaming option, I promptly followed the directions, which was followed up with my pin being emailed to me IN PLAIN TEXT. So not only do they have my personal data stored, potentially everything they have about me is completely unencrypted. Comcast has this area in a vice, and there is nothing us as the consumers can do.

Now I'm being billed $322.19 with a back due of $190.33 for extra equipment and waived off orders for Comcast customer service mistakes, lies, and fraudulent entries added to my account. Also my online statement has even been tampered with and not reflecting the correct due amount after I've recently paid Comcast through it's online services.

 Good Morning ,
 Since January, I see that you have disputed charges totaling $135.99 for a PPV Movie and SIK shipments and modem rental fees. You have been provided credit totaling $193.99. Therefore, you have been provided $58.00 more credit than the amount billed that you questioned. No further credit is warranted. Currently your lastest billed amount is $203.68. Once that bill is paid, going forward your monthly amount will be $180.36.
 I would be happy to speak to Orlando and have attempted to follow up with him.
 Please have him give me a call at his earliest convenience and I will be happy to review the bill by phone.

 Then Ms. Teresa L. something must be wrong with your accounting system. I've been on time and current with my payment up until the debacle with gateway upgrade I owe nothing not even $2.00 and (Comcast) have no justification for any increases to my account. I suggest you do the math again, because any increases to my account were not and is not warranted or justified based on all the mishandling and outright lies that I've endured just to exchange a gateway (modem) by your personnel which I hope is not a direct reflection upon it's management.
 I still have most communications with your chat services and phone reps. I'm not the one to be played with. I did not appreciated then, I do not appreciated now. Teresa, you contacted my resident on three separate occasions and Mr. Robinson (Orlando) has returned those calls to you only to get your voice mail. So the reply to the BBB was one-sided and like most of the contact with Comcast in general inaccurate.

Not ethical or worthy of my patronage as a customer if this continues onward. You have yet to prove to me the amount increase for any services rendered other than that debacle with your agents. I'm in search of cold hard facts, not your coverup. Show me, prove to me the increased amount was warranted by any means, that's all I ask, nothing more, nothing less.

 Dear Ms Teresa L.
 Your office was contacted (2) twice by my representative Mr. Orlando R. an associate on my Comcast account back on 4/29/2015 @ 17:03pm and then again on 4/30/2015 @ 14:58pm with no reply.
 Orlando has been dealing with the issues that's both equipment and billing related, that's associated to my Comcast account. What I've gathered thus far Ms. Teresa L. is, no one at Comcast up to this point wishes to address the issues that have occurred, to my Comcast account regarding the past debacles with a simple order dated back in March of 2015, for a Arris TG862 to DPC3941T exchange, and all of the other negative issues to my account that has occurred thereafter.
 Ms Teresa L. too many times, and from to many of your representatives, I was told, do to my inconvenience from incompetent service rendered to me, that all fees would be waived regarding transaction for the upgrade, that's including Video SIK Priority Ship, HSI National SIK Charge, Voice/Data Modem Rental (being charged for two (2) with only one in possession at the time) something to do with a specific code not being removed from account.) The Equalizer HD would be waived regarding that it was ordered via malfunctioning remote (key got stuck) and tuned off immediately and not viewed, being charged for inconvenient deals for HBO and Blast for a year due to another incident in which a Comcast agent was trying to remedy botched service which led to my inconvenience back in December 2014 which I believe now is just a bait and switch scheme to over bill my account due to fact that, I would later be charged for those services.
 I believe this to be all by design and not mistakes, since this has happened to me before, at one of your service location back in Sep/2014 in the amount of $445.28 for misinformation given to both myself and Orlando. The agent stated, that if we were to be patient and wait a few days for the downgrade in service to kick in, that we would only be billed for the downgraded amount only. Later that very same agent for Comcast would deny everything she stipulated, that ended in as a direct result, my bill being doubled for that month. Guarantees and promise I think not. Bait and switch I've witness and believe true.
 So Ms, Teresa L. Comcast once again try's to dig deep within my budget to justify increases to my current billing by deceptive practices in overcharging for it's services. My current package deal for one year that began in the month of Oct/2014 for $176.57 quoted now stands at what ? today I don't know...my billing been off the chart since Dec/2014 due Comcast current billing practices and the lack of quality training with it personnel. Currently I am being over billed for $41.83 under your current billing in which I can't fathom where the charges are coming from if any and all fees were waived as stipulated. Somewhere and somehow fees were assessed to my account from whom or why I don't know. All I do know is the agents/representatives/personnel needs to stop with the duplicitous activities and honor their agreements and word.
 Another thing Ms. Teresa L. I would like to address is the misinformation being disseminated or addressed by Comcast agents or information or request that is being given to the agent to be input to account, that is not being recorded by that Comcast agent, at request of the consumer. Why? To cover up misdeeds? All request should be honored if the customer has doubt about the service being rendered.
 So in closing Ms. Teresa L. stop selling your customer base short. Greed amounts to nothing and if Comcast continue along it's current path, encouraging these sort of activities, I 'm pretty sure it will loose a lot more than it's consumers.
 Sincerely, ""Comcast Valued Customer""

2091,"First call on 6/8 was told by Comcast customer rep that I would be able to self install my modem, that their signal was active in my house. Was unable to get the modem working when called in the next day to activate. Tried all 3 modem ports in my house without success. Called Friday 6/19 and once again told that should work but they would be sending out someone to check and get things working. Called Saturday to verify that someone was coming out and was passed around from customer service to the Billing Dept to a rep who said that they would get the service established, but that my problem was that I was on their 19.99 intro offer and that the only way I could keep my internet was to sign up for the next tier of service at 24.99. I told them that I was promised the 19.99 rate for 12 months and that this was ridiculous. Finally after a 10 minute wait on hold I was told they would give me a one time lump sum credit on my bill to compensate for the extra cost of the higher tier service $60.00-why it wasn't $30 I have no idea) Meanwhile no one from Comcast ever came out to my residence to check out why I had no service. Called again on Monday 6/15-one more round of trying the different ports in the house, with no internet activity showing on the modem. Called Tuesday spoke with a rep who said that they hadn't had anyone in my house since 2012 and because of this I would have to have a service call that would cost at a minimum $59.00 rewire the service from outside to inside, although all the previous calls said that I had service in my home. I called again today to see if, like all the other calls, the story had changed, but the rep I talked to confirmed that a service call had been scheduled. On the other hand I'm not inclined to be certain that the 59.00 service call is even necessary given Comcast's absolute certainty that I had a signal and could to a self install. Also, I had asked that they email me with the particulars of what they were promising, but I had received nothing but a billing statement. To their credit , Comcast's bill reflected the promised $60.00 credit, but it was reported as an Xfinity TV line item.

2097,"Comcast internet service has become worse and worse as the cost has gone up and up. Rare I can
 get through to the service department over the phone - I get a message like ""maximum lines
 occupied, call again later"" then the phone line is disconnected.
 When I use the service ""chat"" feature it is a flurry of sales pitches for extra services and rarely an
 answer to why the service keeps dropped and when things will be working properly."
2098,"My bill has been incorrect every month since February. I have contacted Comcast 15 to 20 times
 about the issue. Every agent has said that they had fixed the issue and it would show correctly on the
 next billing cycle. Not the last agent I talked to but the one before that told me that they had fixed my
 issue which he said was do to an ""inactive modem"" charge and that Comcast had filed for ""return
 equipment"". He said that he filed a ticket to have this permanently removed from my bill and that the
 changes would be reflected on my online billing summery within a weeks time and that I would
 receive a phone call confirming that it had indeed been fixed. I did not receive a phone call and my bill
 was still incorrect. The last agent I talked to gave me a completely different story. They said I did not
 receive a phone call because the issue had been fixed (the phone call was to confirm that it had been
 fixed) and that it would show up on my next billing cycle (even though I had just explained what I was
 told the prior week). I keep getting told the same thing. I cannot seem to get the help I need on this.
 They have been the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with and have not solved my
 ongoing issue and don't seem to care.

 Not sure as to why my complaint would be closed. They have not fixed the problem, it has actually
 gotten worse. I am being charged for even more things now that I should not be. On my current bill I
 am being charged $10 for Xfinity TV (which I do not and have never had), I'm being charged twice for
 the modem rental, there is a $15 self install kit charge which should not be there, I am being charged
 tax for TV service every month since February. I need help to get this straightened out and every time
 I have tried they have said that it is now fixed and I have nothing to worry about only to have it more
 messed up than before.

2100,"Comcast has added several extra charges to my bill and changed the rate for service. They doubled
 the rate of service saying that I was on a one-year introductory offer. I made sure when I signed up
 that the price was set and it was not just an introductory offer to avoid this very issue. When I contact
 customer service and explain the issue they tell me the representative who signed me up over a year
 ago was mistaken and there's nothing they can do; I have to pay the bill. Then Comcast also adds
 extra services I did not order such as ""Speed Blast"" for my internet service and ""Xfinity TV"" service.
 Comcast is insisting that I have to pay for these services even though I have never ordered them and
 insisting I have to pay a higher rate because they will not uphold their verbal contract.
 Comcast also is not crediting my account for payments and charging me late fees even though I have
 not missed a single payment until this month (May 2015) and that is because I refuse to pay a
 fraudulent bill."
2101,"The company has continues to raise my bill with miscellaneous taxes, and miscellaneous charges. I called numerous times and they cancel movie channels to bring my bill down below $200.00 and I am losing services, but always paying above 200.00. Every phone call minimum of 4 in the past 18 months has never once lowered my bill below $200.00; rather, I am losing features and paying more!

2102,"I have had Comcast service for many years. Since August of last year I have had horrible service. I have had to call in to the customer service to try to get help. When I do this I usually spend 45 minutes listening to dreadful music only to get a person who barely understands me or vice versa, then they do not want to listen or they transfer my call or my favorite, they hang up so that I can do the process all over again. I have spoken to several supervisors only to be given empty promise after empty promise. Technicians have been sent out by the dozen. My daughter had one in the past that got in her face and tried to attack her because she did not want to give him a box without a receipt at her home. Only doing what the representative on the phone advised her to do. He in turned fried all of her wires. I have been told that I would be given two months free in the amount of 300 dollars and $15 a month of for 6 months. I agreed to this. My service is still not fixed and now they have turned off my service and they are telling me I owe money. They say that the only deal that is noted is for 15 dollars off a month for a year. I never agreed to that because frankly, I am not sure I want to stay with the company that long. I need help. I have been on the phone all day for the past two days. I am running out minutes. I would deeply appreciate if someone could help me. My name is . You can also contact my daughter at

This is outrageously compared to what is charged by Comcast and other providers for the same service in other areas where there is actual competition. Comcast is taking advantage of people like me simply because they have no competition and can charge anything they please because there are no other options locally for truly fast internet.

2106,"I have had nothing but problems with Comcast in the 3 months that I have had their ""service"" - or lack thereof. They missed 2 appointments when I scheduled to have my internet installed and was told that not only would I not be charged once they finally had a technician come out, but I would get a credit for the missed appointments. They charged me $50 for the technician appointment and when I called to complain about the extra charge, the customer service line was absolutely terrible. I could not get in touch with anyone who spoke English and all they could give me were rehearsed, staged responses. I was finally able to speak to two representatives in two different departments who ensured that the charges were removed. However, I logged back into my account the next day and the charges were still there. I had to call back again and ask to speak to a supervisor, who told me that there was no note or anything on my account to remove the charges. The supervisor was able to finally remove them for me. However, I still have complaints because the service is basically non-existent. I am a college student enrolled in online classes and I lose internet connection at least five times a day. I don't know why I am even paying for the service if I am not able to use it.

2108,"I have set up five separate installation appointments with Comcast at my home in the Southern New Jersey area. Four times no one called and no one showed. Once the technician called and said he would be late and still never showed. I have taken personal time off of work to wait for them to arrive. I also tried to self install and found that the equipment given to me was malfunctioning. I have tried to seek out competitors, but none are available to my region. I have been promised numerous credits, and have been given multiple issue numbers that I was told would be used to track my concerns. I do not have any proof that I will receive these promised credits if my services ever do get installed. It seems that I have gone above and beyond what Comcast is willing to do to provide me with any services. I have never felt that they care about any of their customers. I was told by a service center worker that they have a policy for crediting missed appointments, which is entirely asinine as it assumes that they will routinely not keep their appointments. The only remedy that would be better than Comcast actually sending a technician to my home to install me services, would be if the went out of business and some other provider was available. I am feeling like a powerless consumer, without television or internet connection.

2109,"Hello,
 My comcast business class internet has been running extremely slow. We run speed tests, and the tests come out fine, but netflix is buffering constantly and any online video we attempt to watch appears to be throttled. I believe comcast is slowing down certain internet traffic. Browsing is perfectly fine, and fast, but once we start watching video is gets extremely slow.
 We also have been customers of Comcast Business class for over 3 years. When attempted to send large files and video stream, the lag is unbearable.
 Speed tests show speed is fine, but actual performance is slow. We would like to request an upgrade to the Deluxe 75 from the Deluxe 50 for the same price we are paying now.
 I also am request any additional fees for modem rental etc we are paying to be waived. We attempted to use our own modem when we signed up, but were told that we had to use the Modem comcast provided. The last installer also advised there is a new modem that has a router connected, and could provide additional speed. As our business relies on sending files and collaborating online, we would like to request the newest modem, with any additional fees waived.

2111,"I am filing a formal complaint against my internet and TV provider, Comcast, for fraudulently charging
 me for a service I never requested and I never received.
 I moved and changed my service address in October 2014. I have always owned and still own my
 router/modem and do not lease equipement from Comcast. In January 2015, I first noticed a wireless
 gateway device fee had been added to my bill every month since my relocation in October 2014. I
 contacted a Comcast representative (#3) via telephone in January 2015 and informed her of this error
 and she acknowledged Comcast's fault. I also informed her that when I moved, Comcast changed
 my paperless billing log in information and did not notify me. Thus, it caused me difficulty logging on
 and paying my on-line bill. As a result, I incurred a late fee charge due to Comcast changing my log
 in. When I had difficulty logging in, I spoke to two Comcast representatives (#1, #2) on two seperate
 occassions to resolve my non self-initiated change with my log in information. Resprestative #3
 informed me that I was double charged for a late fee and would be fully reimbursed for it. She also
 said I would be reimbursed for the wrongly charged device fee for the past several months and the
 fee will be removed from my account on all future bills. In addition, she said the amount of my credit
 would cover my following month's bill. Representative #3's promised resolution did not occur. I was
 lead to believe my February's bill would be fully credited, but it was not and thus, yet another late fee
 was incurred. I patiently waited for the March bill to be credited, but it was not either.
 I contacted Comcast representative #4 in March/April 2015 to explain my grievances yet again. Of
 course, she assured me the issue would be resolved over the next couple of weeks. I was again lead
 to believe everything would be resolved and again it was not.
 On the 1st of May, my bill still continues to feflect the fraudulent billing. On the 5th of May 2015, I
 contacted Comcast and spoke to Malorie, representative #5. I requested to speak to a supervisor to
 address my continued unresolved grievances. Billing supervisor, Sadie (#6), advised me she could
 only give me a partial credit. When I questioned this, she was somewhat demeaning, short spoken
 and uninterested in completely resolving the issue. When I asked Sadie for someone else's contact
 information that could assist me in recovering my full refund, she clearly stated there was no one else
 that could help me. Was she trying to deprive me of my right to pursue a full refund? I then asked for
 a customer complaint contact and Sadie's first response to me was Comcast did not have such a
 thing. There should have been someone else I could have spoken to regarding my account if she ,
 the supervisor, was incapable of helping me. Sadie also challenged and disputed my observation
 that all my bills since October 2014 has an unwarranted device fee charge.
 I have been extremely patient with Comcast's errors and repeated unfulfilled promses to remedy the
 problem. I am now frustrated and beyond a reasonable doubt, deserve quality customer service. I
 have been paying for a service for which I did not request nor did I receice. This has been going on
 for 8 months. I have been mislead and deceived to believe my account would be corrected on
 mutliple occassions and I would be reimbursed.
 My specific grievances toward Comcast:
 1) Changed my on-line bill pay log in information without notifying me.
 2) Promised and failed on multiple times to resolve fraudulent billing charges.
 3) Incurred late fee charges from Comcast changing my log in and unfulfilled promises to credit my
 account.
 4) Customer service representatives and supervisors that are ill-qualified and unprofessional at
 resolving issues. They lied to me and deceived me.
 5) Informed me of wrong information regarding billing on my account and wrong information regarding
 chain of command and proper problem resolution.
 6) Caused me increased expense on my bill.
 7) Caused me undue distress.
 I would greatly appreciate an investigation in this matter. Thank you for your assistance and interest.

When I returned all equipment and paid the bill they told me that I cannot keep for free their would be a $20.00 basic access charge I asked if I could set it up now they said no that I would need to set it up when I got where I was moving. When I contacted the closest Comcast office to my new address they told me no I cannot pay $20.00 a month to get email access that it would work for 30 days only it only worked for 2 weeks. I contacted the Office of Tom Karinshak at Comcast to try resolve this issue I got telephone run around and was told that they could get it working for 48 hours only. My problem with that is I was a Comcast customer for 10 years that was not enough time to go through my emails and my deceased wife to save my contacts-and emails. I did everything right to make this work they just do not care about the little guy. Did they break any laws or infringe on my rights.

2116,"We had been having trouble with our service cutting out for almost a month having to reset our router, Comcast would not replace our router that we rent even though it was over 6 years old until it actually died. Which it did and then they promised the would send one quickly and would credit us the price of the shipping. Not even two weeks later we lost service again, they wanted us to wait for an appointment which we could not do we argued about what day and finally agreed on a Wednesday. We changed important plans to be available during their time slot. During the time slot we got a call confirming our appointment for a different day. We called again. Complained again. They said they would credit us for the missed appointment and for a months worth of service since that was how long it had been since our service worked properly. I get my next bill and they did NOT credit us for the shipping or the months worth of service and they charged us a huge fee for having someone come out to fix our service which we were never informed of and would have NEVER agreed to...when we call they say there are no supervisors available and they will request the refunds and have no access to see what is happening. Days later and still not credits and no contact from supervisor.

2118,"I have been a Comcast customer since 2011. A couple of days ago Comcast inexplicably disconnected my internet services. When I contacted customer support, I was initially transferred between multiple departments. Finally, one representative told me that there was service outage in my area, that technicians were working on the problem, and that I would be re-connected at 7:30pm that evening. This did not happen.
 Concerned because I had several papers due and needed the internet for research purposes, I contacted Comcast's customer services a second time. This time was told that my account had been deactivated and that in order to reactivate it, I would need to purchase wifi services ($39.99) and a self-installation kit ($9.95). I was told that I could either travel to a local service center or wait 3-5 business days for a kit to be mailed. I chose to wait for the kit to be mailed because I did not have time to travel to the service center.
 Because I needed internet service to complete work for school, I ended up using my cellular hotspot for several days while waiting for the self-installation kit . Charges for the additional data totaled nearly $100.
 When I finally received the self-installation kit, I opened it to find two coaxial cables, a bag of cable tacks, and a splitter. Although I had been told that the kit would contain an activation code, there was no such code in the kit. I did not know what to do with the items I did receive so, once again, I contacted Comcast's customer support.
 The first representative I spoke with was unable to help me and told me that my account was in ""inactive mode."" He then transferred me to another department.
 The second Comcast representative I spoke with was also unable to help but told me that he had ""escalated my issue to upper management."" He then transferred me to another department.
 Finally, the third representative I spoke with was able to reconnect my internet. At no point were any of the items in the self-installation kit used.
 Worst of all, no one bothered to mention that Comcast might have a wifi hotspot in my area that I could use while I was waiting to be reconnected. I only found out that this option was available after a friend mentioned it while I was chatting with the Comcast representative who was finally able to reconnect me. Obviously, by that time this was a moot point.
 This entire process was exhausting and completely uncoordinated. Each representative asked me to list the same information and apparently none kept a record of the issue because I also had to repeat my problem each time.
 At no point was I given an explanation for why my service had been disconnected. Frankly, Comcast's incompetence and total lack of concern for customers is nothing short of appalling.

2119,"This is a complaint about Comcast Cable and Internet company. I recently received notice from a billing collection agency stating I had unpaid charges. This came as a total surprise to me and after speaking with Comcast found out my charges were from 4-5 months ago from when I transferred my account to a roommate as a result of my relocation outside of the Philadelphia area. Essentially, I turned over the account to my roommate and was told by Comcast that there was nothing more to do, the balance was 0 and nothing additional would be in my name at this time (mid December). I made a point of asking this several times.
 Now, as a resident of Washington Dc, I received notice at an old address that I had an unpaid balance. Please note, that during this time I have once again become a Comcast customer. They did not notify me once via phone/email/account that I had these additional charges. After speaking with customer service, I was told the charges were from a time period after the account had been switched out of my name (a period in which I no longer lived at said address). After failed multiple attempts to gain justification of this charge I felt it necessary to register a complaint. At this point I am still waiting for Comcast to contact me. I refuse to contact them again as my last conversation they stated a manager would be in contact with me.

2120,"I signed up for Comcast blast only internet service starting on April 2. According to email exchange with the agent, I was under the impression that I should be getting 105 mbps speed. A week into the service, I realized my internet has been intermittently slow, and disconnected randomly. I called/emailed at least 4-5 times to resolve the issue. It always takes 40-50 minutes. It has only been 30 days into my service and I am wasting 1 hour each week on average just to resolve internet issues.
 Finally Comcast sent in a technician to replace my modem thinking maybe that is the problem. After the modem was changed, my internet speed dipped to even lower to about 1-2 mbps and meanwhile I am still paying for 59.99 per month for this speed. I chatted Comcast agent once again the same night on April 30.
 He offered me to change the modem for free, and then somehow said shipping would be charged. This makes no sense to me whatsoever since Comcast was at fault for changing it to the wrong modem, and now I am paying for shipping of a new modem. Then he asked me if I wanted to upgrade my 50 to 105. I was beyond confused because this entire time I thought I should be getting 105 according my email with the salesperson. With more incompetent explanation, he upgraded my service to 105 and said it was free then finally summarized that it would cost me $10 more monthly.

2121,"Comcast switched our service from an old to a new office location. We did not have service at the
 new location until 3 weeks later and were still being billed for the service to the old location (which
 was useless to us as our office had moved when the lease ended). Comcast refuses to extend a
 credit for the time we did not have service at the new location (2/27-3/18/15) since there ""was no
 interruption in service""."
2122,"I have requested of Comcast numerous times to issue a refund for an overpayment on my account.
 They have in various ways refused. Recently, I downgraded my TV service and upgraded my Internet
 for a net reduction in cost. They have billed me this month for the previous amount. Furthermore, their
 website is not accessible as it is saying I have an invalid email address on file. I am using this email
 address for various other purposes and I can reset my password on Comcast by sending a reset
 email to the ""invalid"" email address.
 Details of Refund
 I moved from a VA address to DC
 I requested a refund of overpayment to my VA address
 They posted a refund to the account I have moved
 The VA and DC account are linked
 Comcast refuses to issue a refund via check and they will not apply my credit to the account for the
 current address I live in
 To date, I have not received a clear answer why. On numerous occasions, they have stated they will
 be mailing the check.
 In my current apartment, I can only use Comcast and have no other option."
2123,"MI am a comcast customer and believe strongly that the robust broadband service comcast should be
 providing is somehow being slowed. I constantly use internet for various reasons and it does appear
 to be losing speed."
2124,"I called Comcast in April to ask how I could lower my monthly bill which I thought was too high. The first person I talked with said I could lower it by adding a landline service. I declined to do that because it seemed ridiculous that by adding a service I could lower my bill. Later that day I noticed that I no longer had HD service on the TV. I called Comcast to ask why and they said that I had never actually paid for it and had received the service free in error. Having been made aware of it, the company had cut it off. I asked for it to be reinstated which is when the incident of trying to lower my bill was raised. Again this second person said I could lower my bill if I added a landline. I spoke AT LENGTH with this person asking how it was possible to add a service and pay less. I asked for reassurance that if I did do this that my bill would not simply go up in a few months time. He said there was no catch and no hidden fees so I agreed to go ahead with it and was duly given a landline number. (I still do not possess a landline phone so this was done purely because I was guaranteed a lower monthly bill.) Imagine then my surprise when, one month later, I got my bill to find it right back up where it was before. I called Comcast on May 28 to get an explanation and was told that the service was ineligible with ""promotional pricing."" I am not aware of receiving any promotional pricing as I have had service since November 2013, but in any event Comcast did not inform me about this until AFTER I called them for an explanation, yet my bill was sent to me by email on May 23. Curiously, after I called to question the bill I immediately received a letter reiterating the explanation. I find it highly suspect that two employees gave me the same information in two entirely separate phone calls and this would appear to be a classic case of bait and switch. If nothing else it is exceptionally poor business ethics and/or employee training and I am sure I am not the only person affected by this.

2125,"To Whom This May Concern:
 Yesterday (6/10/15), I called a customer service executive to request a promotional service because our previous promotion expired ($69.99), which escalated this month's bill ($88.95). In order to reduce to the original amount-at least close to it, I informed the executive of this reduction and was able to obtain a fair deal with a new promotional package for $79.99/month. Additionally, I asked for clarification regarding the total amount that would appear on next month's billing cycle to ensure I understand what is expected me even after I explicitly asked about other charges/fees that may apply. The executive again reiterated that total amount of the bill will show $79.99. I was perfectly content with this amount until I received this summary below:
 Name:
 Email: Phone:
 XFINITY Bundled Services
 Blast! Plus Includes Digital Economy Service, HBO, Streampix with Digital Converter and Blast! Internet Promotional Rate. Promotional Rate for 12 months $69.99
 Additional XFINITY Internet Services
 AC Wireless Gateway $10.00
 Other Charges & Credits
 Broadcast TV Fee $3.25
 Taxes, Surcharges & Fees $7.51
 Grand Total $90.75
 After receiving this summary in the above email, I noticed the total amount was incorrectly stated by the executive during the call. She indicated that the total amount would be $79.99 on the next billing cycle, but according to the above summary that is not evident ($90.75). Thus, I called Comcast customer service executive to discuss the matter, and it was apparent a miscommunication occurred on Comcast's end. The executive kindly apologized and said that they would transfer me to the appropriate department/division to modify the amount. Upon transfer, I spoke with another customer service executive and in sum indicated they cannot make any changes regarding the fees/other charges because they cannot control for city taxes and etc. I understood that, but there was still an incorrect disclosure of my next billing statement and perhaps promised a modifications; and, yet, nothing was resolved despite explaining my concern explained at the beginning of this complaint. As a result of this recursive concern, I requested the above promotional offer to be rescinded. (b) (6)

 I am very disappointed by how this was handled, and request this complaint to be addressed as soon as possible.

2127,"Since at least last year, Comcast has been sending letters to high speed internet subscribers using DOCSIS 2 modems, either offering free upgrades or telling them that they would no longer receive service on their existing equipment without upgrading. I (and, according to many web forums, many others) received one of the ""free upgrade"" offers, both by postal mail and telephone, instructing me to visit a website to be sent a free modem upgrade. The DOCSIS 3 modem arrived quickly and included a label and instructions to send the existing equipment for recycling. However, upon activation of the new equipment, I (and the others on the forums) were billed, and when I contacted Comcast, they refused to cease the charges and instead insisted ""free upgrade"" meant ""free shipping,"" I ended up returning the equipment, and was told at the service center that it was probably a system error that misidentified me as already having Comcast equipment on my account, and that it was an issue that was sufficiently common to be a known situation (but that they still wouldn't refund the charges). I was without service due to lack of equipment for several weeks, much of which time I'd paid for service; I then had to pay the rental fees for the ""free upgrade"" and back service charges as well as a reconnection fee. I don't mind paying legitimate fees, but I'd rather be without service than put up with such dishonesty in a regulated industry (or elsewhere, really).

2130,"Summary: Comcast is an effective monopoly in my area for both cable and broadband internet. They price well outside comparable pricing for the broader DC metro area and use direct knowledge that customers have no other option to maintain their price point.
 --
 I have had Comcast for cable and internet for just over a year since moving to my current apartment. I previously lived in a DC suburb and had Verizon FIOS. Upon moving I discovered my options were surprisingly limited. The other two providers for the DC Metro are RCN and Verizon:
 RCN is currently advertising $49.99 for 110MBPS with a 3 year price assurance
 Verizon FIOS is advertising $50/month for 50MBPS plus 20+ basic cable channels and HBO and Showtime for 2 years.
 These are both reasonable prices for the region. Neither services are available in my specific location. The most recent Comcast agent I spoke to specifically told me this (I already knew), they use this knowledge to enforce their unreasonable billing practices knowing I have no comparable alternative. That smells like a monopoly to me.
 New Comcast customers currently have access to this offer:
 $54.99 for 105 MBPS, 45 channels, and HBO and Showtime.
 That strikes me as a reasonable and competitive pricing package. After multiple attempts, a series of agents all refused to offer me anything remotely resembling that package. My comparable offered options are:
 $93.95 for 105 MBPS and 50 channels
 $78.95 for just the 105MBPS internet (still requires additional voice or cable service on top of that price, which in any combination results in over $100 at least)
 These options are literally twice the rates of their ostensible competitors. If this does not count as an unfair and unreasonable billing practice, I don't know what legal value that word has.
 Please note that I have already initiated a cancellation of my service. I would be willing to reapproach them if they revise their billing practices more in line with market standards. But generally, I am not doing this for myself; I've given up. I just want to make sure my experience is documented and can be used when the time comes as support for the larger issue of Comcast as an effective monopoly so that the FCC can take action against further abuses of their market position.

2131,"Comcast/Xfinity is the only internet and cable provider offered in several locations in DC, including my apartment building, and seem quite content to have monopolized the neighborhood, as evidenced by the complete apathy and lack of care exhibited by the customer service representatives. I have spoken to more than ten representatives over the past several weeks (not including online chats) and still don't have cable/internet set up in my apartment. I was told over a week ago that the modem and installation equipment would be shipped to my home, but nothing has arrived. I called Comcast again today only to confirm that nothing has shipped and was told by more than one representative that I would be better off driving halfway across town to pick up the installation kit myself than to rely on Comcast to ship it to my home. I even commented to one of the representatives today that Comcast has the worst customer service of any company with which I have ever dealt and the representative AGREED and said that he hears that a lot!!! Comcast's head doesn't seem to know what its tail is doing. Each representative I speak to tries to send me to another department rather than help resolve the issue. In the future, I will know better than to live in an apartment community that only offers Comcast cable and internet. In a country that advertises freedom of choice, it's frustrating to be the victim of monopolistic behaviors.

2132,"On June 24, Comcast raised my monthly bill for internet at 25mbps from $34.95 to $66.95 without warning. They nearly doubled my bill for the exact same service. Earlier this year, my internet speed was being throttled, but I was able to resolve this through their customer service operation. I reside in an area of DC not serviced by RCN, so I believe they are using their lack of competition to price gouge.

2133,"1. I recently purchased Arris TG852gf modem for high spped internet and phone service. This model was recommended by a Comcast customer service representative. After purchase and delivery, I tried to activate the modem through Comcast and found that 10 separate customer service representatives either did not know how to activate this modem or told me that the modem would not work with Comcast service. A supervisor finally managed to remotely activate the modem.
 2. After a couple of weeks, we have been having intermittent internet service outages in which the signal drops out for 1 to 2 minutes at a time. Customer service has told me that the could not send a refresh signal to my modem since I did not lease it from Comcast. They told me it was a privacy issue. Comcast is (despite terms of service to the contrary) indirectly insisting that we lease a modem from them by withholding service.

2134,"My Comcast service has been exceptional for the last several years I have been living here (tests at 105 MB/s down and 12 MB/sec up, exactly what we pay for). About two months ago, my internet service started dropping to as low as 12 MB/sec in the evening. During the day and after about 11:00 in the evening it tests fine, in the evening we cant do more than one thing on the internet service I pay for (the better plan) at a time. We pay for their higher package and don't get near what we are paying for. Comcast has traced it to their system and has looked at it when I complain, but still 2+ months later there is nothing. When I call the customer service, they barely speak English and they don't have a clue how to help except to tell me to reboot the modem. I have cooperated with Comcast (locally and their national tech support) and again, they stated the problem is in their system, not my home. I have documentation in the form of screen shots and pictures which I shared with Comcast to help trouble shoot the issue, but they still state there is ""feedback"" on the system from someone on the same node and have not taken enough time to figure it out. The local tech supervisor, Bill, has been friendly and I think tries to help (no complaint about him at all), but after two months of getting 20% of what I pay for, I am extremely unhappy and since Comcast has a monopoly, what else can I do? I know Comcast has to respond to these complaints, Its sad I have to file with the FCC to get help, but I am sick of not getting what I pay for and having my family inconvenienced when I pay for the better service that specifically states I should have more than enough bandwidth. I'm an advanced user and have proven to the local Comcast folks its not in my home, so Comcast, please don't tell me to reboot the modem again.

 Comcast has charged me for a second cable card for the past four months that I do have. They claim it was given to me and cannot be found anywhere in their system, so I must have it. They have also raised my bill a month after I signed a contract guaranteeing a set price for two year.
 I have contacted customer server numerous times, both in person and over the phone, getting different answers from each Comcast representative. In my first month, the cost for the cable card was removed from my bill, but in following months I have been met with increasingly rude employees to the point where I can no longer get through by phone as I am placed on hold until I eventually hang up.

2138,"Comcast/Xfinity is a virtual monopoly in my city/zip code and has been a monopoly for years. The have used their monopoly status to institute ""price creep"", wherein their prices jump by 20 to 25 percent every year like clockwork for no other reason than a year has gone by. If you call to complain, they do not reinstate their previous monthly fee, they simply knock it back a bit to a 10 to 15 percent jump and expect you to be grateful. Comcast/Xfinity's prices have become unjust and unreasonable, and there is nowhere else to go if we find their fees unacceptable. If there was real competition, the cost would be substantially lower and the service substantially better, as they were in my previous residence where Comcast and Time Warner Cable vied for our dollars in true competition.

2140,"To whom it may concern,
 I signed up for Comcast cable/Wifi services in February, 2015. I have yet to receive satisfactory service & wifi. I wanted to inform you that this is complaint number two, so you can read the issues from the last time, and see how frustrating this is to not have it resolved.
 After the FCC communicated with Comcast the first time, they basically credited my account, and did nothing else. Comcast said they would send a technician out to do a rewire(for the third time), and I am not sure if they actually came and serviced the outside of the building or not. I ALWAYS pay my bills in a timely manner(a couple of weeks before the date it's due to be more specific), but it is difficult for me to send them payment, for NO service.
 This is supposed to be a fast wifi provider. The wifi download speed is advertised at 25 mbps.....I have never ran a test that was over 13 mbps. Most tests(9 times out of 10, literally) are under 5 mbps. I cannot play Pandora without it stopping to buffer numerous times. Some pages won't even load because of how slow the internet is. My roommate prefers to turn off her wifi connection to her phone, because her data is faster, she also cannot take her online college classes from home because of the lack of wifi.
 The basic cable portion works, but I do not even use the cable, I signed up for this package because I was told the cable/wifi bundle is cheaper than wifi package its self.
 When Comcast is called, they will say I am late on payment( I owe them money from May and June). I personally do not think it's right they are expecting me to pay this amount, when I cannot use their services.
 Thank you for your help with this. It seems the only time I get a response from them, is if the FCC is involved. Thank you for your time. I will make the switch to another provider if they cannot resolve this.

2144,"I recently received service from Xfinity Comcast since November of 2015 after I was given the bait and switch of trying to get service through Time Warner Cable. 1. I was fraduently charged for shipping on paper materials that I did not need due to self installation. 2. After experiencing numerous attacks on a personally bought modem that eventually lead to my service being disconnected led to me having to rent one of Xfinity's modems. Mind you all attacks came from their server. 75.75.75.76. All of a sudden I'm not experiencing attacks on the modem anymore. 3. I'm being charged additional late fee's when I have explained to them that I am on a fixed income and can only make payments on the 1st and 3rd of every month. They told from the time that I started the service from Nov. 5, 2014 that I had either 28 to 30 days to pay the bill. On top of that there is a 7 day grace period in which to pay the bill. They offered to change the bill's due date for a fee of $15.00 then turned around and told me I was not eligible for this service. Yet they told me if I did not pay the bill by the 25th of every month these fees will continue to occur. I have paid my bill every month on either the 1st or within a couple of days before hand. This month I have occurred a late fee that I was unaware of until I actually paid the bill. I do not receive a paper bill yet I did the 1st two months of service. They keep throwing these extra fees and hidden charges towards my account. I need this service for schooling and personal activities. They refuse to do anything because there are no other service providers in the area. I had spent over 2 hours on the phone with them to at least meet me half way in either correcting there policies or changing my service dates. They absolutely refused and told me one thing and then told me another.

2146,"There is so much bandwidth being stolen by marketing adds that even top-tier broadband speeds can't manage it. I have a plan for 100 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload speeds and I struggle almost all the time! Anymore, I usually have to re-load pages because they lock up from all the parasites jumping on to my connection. Why is this going on? Does the F.C.C. realize the impact this causes across our nation? I kid you not, it has become a miserable equation for end-users paying big money for more speed!
 There are two things that our country should be doing immediately. One and most important: Cyber-hacking reversal. (The only effective return is to counter-hack within minutes of an incoming attack! Something needs to be done before we end up in America's next World War! Cyber War!!!)
 Two: I run two firewalls on my personal computers and they run simultaneously with out sucking my bandwidth down. I don't feel I have a choice in this matter, because the malware, grey ware, viruses, bots and crawlers demand it be done. Stolen identities, being another worry for all of us, is easily hidden in pages that have all that parasitic activity going on. Try going to MSN....navigate around, reading news and things of that nature. Clean navigation destroyed by the effects of spamming, movie ads, vendor ads and the tracking cookies from companies and corporations. If I look at a Sears Tool Set today, I will have ads pop up all over the place for a few days about tools from Sears!!! Geeez! Must you allow that to go on?

 Comcast would offer me services for $29.99 a month for the same speed ( 25 meg per second)
 download speed and upload speed of 5 megs per second. She reassured me that this was a
 legitimate offer and I asked her to reconfirm this which she did several times. She then said she had
 to transfer me to the customer retention dept to finish the deal. When I was transferred to Antoinette
 in the customer retention dept and she made me repeat everything all over again and started trying to
 sell me packages again. I told her that I had already agreed to retain services for the 25 megs per
 second for $29.99 and she attempted to use a bait and switch tactic. She told me the $29.99 offer
 was no longer available ( even though it clearly is available on their web site) and tried a bait and
 switch tactic to upgrade me to 50 mps for a higher price of $39.99. I said I was not interested and
 asked for the original offer. When she denied this I asked for a supervisor and she hung up on me. I

 GA and started at my new address Wellington, FL 33414. On Monday June 16,
 see attached document, I received an email telling me that my move request was being processed.
 When I spoke with the Comcast employee they told me my service would be stopped on Sunday
 June 22, 2014 and someone would be out on Wednesday June 25th to have my service reconnected.
 I was told at this time to take the equipment with me. When the Comcast employee arrived at my
 home he arrived with new equipment and told me that he didn't need my old equipment from GA. I
 simply put it in a drawer. In July of 2014 I received a bill from Comcast which I assumed was for the
 installation of my new service and new bill so I paid it. I then received a bill in August of 2014 and I
 assumed at that time that it was my final bill from GA and I paid it. In Oct of 2014 I received another
 bill from Comcast for my old address in GA and I questioned it. I tried to call the number on the bill
 and I kept getting disconnected. I then decided to do an online chat a Comcast employee to resolve
 this issue. ( see attached ) I was told that this was a mistake on their part and the bill would be
 waived. In December of 2014 I received another bill that had been adjusted but there still was a
 balance due. I the number on the Comcast bill and spoke with a Comcast employee named Mary
 and I explained everything to her. She instructed me to go to any Comcast center in FL along with
 my documentation and that they could resolve this issue for me. I did that and was told that Comcast
 FL couldn't do anything about Comcast GA. I then went out into the parking lot and called Comcast
 customer service again. I spoke with a Rich, who couldn't pull up my account. I came home sat
 down in front of my computer and called Comcast again. I reached a Steve who told me that he
 would take care of everything. In Jan 2015 I started receiving calls from a collection agency saying
 that they were trying to collect on a debt. I told them at that time that I had contacted Comcast and it
 was their mistake and I didn't owe the money. Since Jan of this year I have been going back and
 forth with Comcast on this issue. I have spoke with so many different people that kept telling me that
 yes this was a Comcast issue and it would be resolved. Today I spoke with Byron P. who told me
 without looking at any of my documents that the debt was valid. I did send him the same documents
 that are attached below and he told me that again the debt was valid. I asked then how on one of the
 documents provided dated June 16 2014 which says, "" Your recent move request is being
 processed"". I told Mr. Byron that if I was moving then it is logical to assume that I would have
 serviced stopped at one location and started at another location. On the copy of the Comcast work
 order attached it shows that my account was a change of service. He told me that changing service
 from one location to another does not constitute notifying Comcast to stop service. I said to Mr.
 Bryon if I was moving and I told you I was moving why would I still have service at my old address.
 My Bryon said that Comcast has many customer with multiple locations and multiple accounts. I do
 understand that point but I called Comcast to set up my move and have my old service stopped and
 my new service started. Mr. Bryon said that there were no notations in my account that stated I
 wanted to stop my service at my GA address. My point is if I am calling Comcast and I say I want my
 service stopped at one location and started at another and then Comcast sends a tech out to install

 (b) (6)
 my new service that shows I had stopped the service. I was also told by Mr. Byron that I spoke with a
 technician from Comcast at on November 13th, 2014. I handed him the
 equipment and told the tech I would be paying the bill in full in Jan. 2015. This is not true. One I still
 have the equipment sitting on my desk as I type this right now and two I was already living in FL at
 that time and was not in the state of GA. When I pointed out this error to Mr. Bryon he didn't have a
 response other than it was notated on the account which he was suggesting that I was lying to him. I
 asked about my copy of the chat requested that I provided and was told that could be an altered
 document and he couldn't accept that as evidence. I still contend that I do not owe this past do bill
 that the error was on Comcast's part. I have tried everything I know how to resolve this issue."
2150,"I was given an appointment for Sunday the 7th due to an Internet issue. Five! Phone calls and sitting in my house from 12-8 resulted in no technician and a supervisor(6th phone call) stating that my ticket read that building access was denied. I live in a gated community with a 24hour manned gate, therefore it was a complete lie because I never received any phone call from either my gate or the tech! They rescheduled me for today but I had requested after 3pm but had a robo call late last night confirming my appointment for today from 8-12pm. Two more phone calls were placed to insure the proper time. It should never be this difficult to obtain service!! I pay monthly for a business Internet line that costs more than a standard line to ""insure prompt"" service!! Completely frustrating and totally unprofessional!! Something needs to be done. And I should be compensated for my time and aggravation!!

 Dear Sir,
 Received my bill today without the credit I was promised on June 30, 2015.Ref # 329414.
 My bill states I owe an unpaid balance of $132.74; but the letter clearly states a credit was issued for account number . Can you please straighten this out at your earliest convenience.

Please, reconsider the subsidies that are given to Comcast. I mean really, they have the worst customer service record-it's unacceptable that they can get away with.
 For heaven's sake, Comcast is literally the only provider in my apartment. They sold me an internet speed of 125 Mbps! What do i receive right now? An average of 2 Mbps! Are they throttling my internet speed or are there legitimate infrastructure issues? Either way, the amount of money they charge and the amount of tax payer's dollars is unacceptable when we compare to the state of internet availability in other countries. Please rein in Comcast.

2153,"Hello,
 I don't know if the FCC handles complaints about home security systems, but I have one through Comcast that I can't seem to rectify through the company. Below is my email to the SVP of customer service about the issue, since I can't seem to get it rectified through the company. It's more of a deceptive sales practice issue, but I wanted to send it to the FCC in case it was under the FCC's jurisdiction.
 ""Hi Tom,
 I'm sure you get quite a few complaints, since there seems to be no way to contact Comcast supervisors other than waiting hours on hold after unsuccessfully trying to rectify problems through the phone system. I wanted to let you know of an issue with my service that I'm extremely unhappy about, and will submitting yet another complaint to the FCC regarding Comcast's deceptive sales practices and inept customer service.
 I want to cancel my home security system, which I've had for just less than one year. When I signed up for the service, I was told by the representative that I would be able to cancel it after one year without a cancellation fee. Since my wife and I don't use it as much as we thought we would, I wanted to cancel it. Unbeknownst to me, I apparently signed up for a 3 year contract, and was notified that I will be charged a $960 cancellation fee to cancle now. You do realize that I could pay my next 2 years in full, and STILL be out less than the cancellation fee.
 So here is what I want to see. First, I want to be provided the documentation that I signed indicating that I am contracted for three years. If I did sign such a document, I also want my call logs examined from last July (when I originally signed up), which will indicate that I was led to believe that I was only signing up for a one year home security system contract. I want my to cancel my home security system immediately, with NO cancellation fee, or since I haven't quite made it my full year, I will wait until July 3rd to cancel if that would eliminate the cancellation fee.
 Once again, Comcast has engaged in a deceptive sales practice. I waited over 30 minutes to speak with a supervisor. Unfortunately, my job (which, believe it or not, is not to wait on the phone waiting to speak to a Comcast customer service supervisor) intervened, and I never actually spoke to him/her.
 I will be submitting a complaint with the FCC as well, because I've been through this before with Comcast, and have little faith that this will be recified through the company.""

2156,"Hello,
 My name is , my e-mail address is and my account number with Comcast is . When I started the Blast Plus With HBO contract, my bill was $87.69. Now they are charging equipment costs that weren't part of the contract and the bill is $95.18. I am having a big problem with Comcast regarding my service agreement and bill for my TV and Internet services. I spoke with a representative from Comcast and she stated that I was calling about the rate increase on all my services equipment on my plan last month. My contract didn't say my price would ever change for two years, but Comcast went ahead anyway and increased the equipment fees. I was told by the Comcast rep that my plan rate didn't change but the cost of the equipment changed and she said Comcast didn't have control of the cost of the equipment. The Comcast rep gave me this telephone number (1-888-225-5322), which is a number for the FCC, to talk about the equipment charges. Then, by surprise, I was told by the people of the above number that they are not the ones who charge for the equipment or handle the equipment increase charges. The Comcast Rep told me incorrect information. I learned that the FCC only takes complaints (which I am writing to you now).
 I would like this to be investigated because Comcast is giving the wrong information, charging higher prices that break the contract terms and accusing other people for the responsibility of any rate changes.
 You can call me at if details need to be explained further.
 Thank you,

2157,"Hi,
 I would like to thank for providing this user-friendly platform to address consumer grievances.
 We have a comcast high speed internet service at our . Last month we faced many disruptions e.g. wi-fi connection dropping suddenly and hence called comcast customer service. Customer service suggested a service visit to check modem and connection and the service person arrived that week, inspected the service and told us that this is due to network congestion from comcast's part and way to avoid this is to avoid peak hours.
 Afterwards this month we checked comcast charged an additional amount of $70 to our account and since my account is on autopay, they deducted that amount automatically.
 When I reached out to the customer billing department they claimed this is for that service visit. When I pointed out that we were never informed that this service visit is chargeable, they shrugged and said nothing can be done as this has already been charged. I asked to talk to the manager and the representative took my number and told manager will call me in 24-48 hrs. I never received a callback from comcast.
 My complaint are following,
 1. How can comcast charge me without any authorization (written/verbal) from my part?
 2. Since the service and equipment (modem/router) is owned by comcast, how can they charge the customers additionally for doing a service of their equipment/infrastructure? Since we customers pay for the end product aren't we already are paying for maintenance of these?
 I would like to thank FCC and hope this complaint will be addressed. Please feel free to reach me in case any additional details are required.

2158,"This is a typical issue with disordered customer service. I understand a big org can make mistake, but can not understand why it can consistently make mistake. Story:
 I used my own router for internet. April 29th, returned my cable box. but got a bill afterwards saying unreturned equipment. Called, they said that was cable box and will investigate, no call about invetigation. continue getting bill this time with late payment charge...... Called, this time they say it is about router, not box. And I told them I am use my own router.... then they need to initiate another investigation..... Wait no call from investment. Got another letter with asking equipment charge.
 Calling customer service again..... This time good news is: the charge for the equipment is gone with magic, but the late payment charge is still there ($5).... The representative saying no equipment charge and late payment fee and the $5 is service fee left over..... I was really pissed off and strongly ask her to review my account item by item and take responsibilities. obviously she reviewed and credit the $5. It's been three months and took me so much time answering comcast ridiculously phone calls and emails as harassment
 Hope I will never ever deal with comcast again. but who knows maybe I will get another letter ask me to return the equipment....

2159,"I have called Comcast three or more times about charging me for internet overage. I have asked them if they could cap my bill if my family goes over the monthly allotted usage given to us. They refuse to do this but keeps charging me 10.00 for every 50GB we go over. My bill has an extra $50.00 every month. This makes no sense because I call every three months or so trying to get a discount on my Triple Play package. I make 360.00 a week and Comcast is taking a lot of my money. My last straw was today. I tried to call and get an address to send a complaint. I talked to Andy, then Greg, and then the dial tone. I called back and talked to Ada and then Francis. Francis is a gift sent from heaven. I told him what I have told other representatives in the past. He helped me (even though I stayed on the phone about thirty-five minutes)and did what others in the past said they could not do. He told me it should be reflected on my next month's bill but I decided to go ahead and file this complaint because this cost me over $150.00. If they would have capped our usage in the beginning then this could have saved me lots of money, but instead they LIED and said it could not be done. I hope this lie cost them dearly like it has cost me!

2160,"I use Comcast's Business Class service for my home service because of their data cap limits which I have run into in the past when transferring video and artwork to and from my clients doing graphic design work. I get nothing else out of the service other than this lifting of data caps.
 When I first signed up it was $99.95 a month, but a year or so ago it changed to $109.95 a month. When sold the package by Comcast you're told that's what your monthly fee will be, but of course that's not the truth. There's additional fees that have nothing to do with tax.
 The first is an ""equipment fee"" for 12.95 every single month where you rent in perpetuity the modem you use to connect to their service. You are given the option to purchase your own modem and use it. I went that route before, but when you do that they don't offer customer service when there are connection issues; there are always connection issues when using your own modem because they make sure there are. When you call you're told that your modem is incompatible with their service and you must either use theirs or buy a new one from a list of supported modems -- the list I checked before purchasing the supported modem that is somehow unsupported but yet still on that list. This creates an infinite loop process where you're essentially forced into renting their modem to keep from having these connection issues. You are not given the option to purchase the modem from them. Because of their underhanded customer service tactics this fee is essentially mandatory and brings the cost of the service from the advertised $109.95 to $122.90.
 The second fee is a ""static IP fee"". The story behind this fee comes from when I was having connection issues with their supplied modem and was sent upwards in their customer support tier. The guy on the phone was extremely helpful and even monitored my internet connection and logged when it went offline. He sent technicians out here and to the neighborhood to check lines. My modem was replaced. Nothing worked. He decided when he was about out of ideas to put me on a static IP address because it would put me on a different node than the one that services my area. It worked, and to this day for me to have reliable service I must have a static IP. That fee is an additional $19.95 a month, bringing the monthly bill to $142.85. To offset this extra cost I am credited that every month. Charging $20 a month for a static IP address is, however, egregious when there's no extra work necessary to supply it other than giving an IT guy at Comcast my modem's MAC address. Their network equipment simply assigns me the IP address automatically.
 If you check my enclosed bill you will see that my monthly credit is $30. $19.95 of that is a credit for the static IP fee. The rest is because I was double billed for about 5 months straight two years ago. Instead of just refunding me the money they instead have given me a small discount every month bit by bit simply because after two years of inflation that doesn't cost them as much as just refunding my money as they should have.

2161,"May of 2014 I entered into a promotion with Comcast for an internet promotion where I paid for Economy plus $29.99 and would be boosted to the Blast speed of 50Mpbs. This agreement was for 24 months. Every month for awhile I had to call in because my internet was so poor. We would do speed test after speed test and never got anywhere near the 50Mpbs promised. June 13th I called in complaining after doing a speed test and my speed was literally .8 my understanding that is close to dial up. They told me my promo was removed. I asked how can you remove a 24 month promo if I have only had it 12 months. They informed me that it was not in their system anymore and I would have to go to a new promo. That being said, they set me up with Performance internet 25Mbps for $29.99 + $10 modem fee on Monday June 15th. After this switch my service kept dropping. I logged in about 21 calls to Comcast and was issued 5 escalation tickets. I was promised a tech to visit multiple days and they never showed up. Finally on Monday June 22nd they told me that a tech would show up and and he did on Wednesday June 24th. As I am writing this I am on the phone with Comcast now and have been on the phone for over 2 hrs and 12 mins so far. I finally got a technician to come out to my house where I was paying for internet only and was promised $29.99 for 12 months that I signed up for on June 15th. While the tech was there he informed me that I had phone service to. I argued and told him no I do not I do not even own a phone. He advised me to call Comcast's customer service and inquire. I did just that and sure enough they have added home phone to my account with out my authorization. They informed me that my bill would be $79.99 not $29.99. I have been on the phone now for over 2 hours and have talked to numerous people and they are telling me that they cannot remove the home phone that I did not request. I did get one lady in retention to say she was going to issue a $55 credit for June but she is unable to remove the home phone. I am now in a different department that also says they cannot remove the home phone and asked that I call in monthly and request a credit for this service. This in my opinion would constitute cramming because I DID NOT ORDER phone service. I am livid, and after 21 calls and hours on the phone this still is not resolved. There is no reason why my phone should be clocking over 2 hours now of trying to get a service off of my account that I did not order. They just keep saying their system will not allow them to remove it. I do not have the time to call in and sit on the phone monthly and hope that I can get someone to issue me a credit for a service I did not authorized. I need help to get this fixed!

2162,"Initially when signing up for service a few years back, there were no data caps or overage charges.
 Over the past year of so, me and my family use Netflix a fair bit, as well as many digital game purchases which usually leads to us exceeding the newly implemented ""data cap"".
 I do not consider this small of an allowance fair, as many coworkers are experiencing the same. The fact that if I go over by 1GB on the last day I am charged an additional $10, but the unused amount is never refunded to my bill, which would seem fair.

 they have been charging almost 200 dollars a month. I tried to get this resolved they them but after
 being hung up on twice and lied to about having a manager contact me so I'm all out of options to
 have this issue resolved. Thank you."
2165,"This is the second time I've been overbilled by Comcast. (The first time was 2.5 years of being
 overbilled, which took me (6) months to retrieve)
 I've talked to comcast at least (6) times since February about this, and it's still not resolved. They say
 they'll credit the account and don't."
2166,"Good evening,
 Back in 2013 I was living in a cottage at a scuba club. Because I lived at the scuba club, I was told I MUST have a business account for my small cottage. The rate for JUST internet is $89 a month, and I was put into a contract until 2016. It was not until after I signed my paperwork that I realized I was locked into a Comcast Business contract, which has over a $1,000 fee to get out of. I called Comcast several times, explained that I was a schoolteacher and was not affiliated, worked for, or even had my own business, but, they said they could do nothing.
 Fast forward now to June of 2015. I moved to a new location about 6 weeks ago. Comcast has come to set up/transfer my internet 3 times and was unable to successfully do that. The second time they came they were 2 hours and 45 minutes late (past my 1-3 time frame). When they did arrive they said they had to put in a new line, which would require a ""bury team"" to later come on a DIFFERENT day and bury it. But, because I had a dog and they would have to bury it in my driveway, they could not leave it above ground.
 Finally, a technician came for a third time, again without a bury crew, and reiterated the same thing. I had been assured at the previous visit that a bury crew and technicians would come at the same time. Then, 3 days later, I come home from work (with NO knowledge that this would happen) and find the line buried in the ground, except it is attached to the house in front of my house. I was not given a phone call or any time of warning that this would happen. I was also not present when it happened. Is this even legal? Now I have to explain to the people in the house in front of me why there is a new box and orange lines drilled into the side of their house?!
 I pay $89 for business internet until 2016 without any affiliation with a business, have gone 6 weeks with no internet, and now have Comcast technicians drilling and putting lines on the wrong home without my knowledge or consent or me being present during the time of digging.

2169,"On March 23, 2015, I noticed my internet and cable services were down. The following day, March 24, I called Comcast to inquire about the issue. I was told my modem was outdated and not up to their current standards. That same day I went out and purchased a modem that they had suggested. When I returned home, I called back to set up my new modem. This time, I was told my previous modem was fine and that the real problem is an outside, underground line that went down. Over the next couple of weeks I had 4 technician visits to my home. Every technician told me the same thing; that I had an underground wire that needed to be replaced, but that they themselves could not do the job. Each of these technicians also told me that a rush ticket would be submitted for the proper repairs. On April 14, 2015, I found a letter left on my front door that stated they had surveyed the land and would be back within 14 days to complete the repair (document attached). The day after that time period had passed, April 29, I called to request that my most recent bill be credited to my account considering I was not receiving the services that I pay for. The bill amounts to $84.86 and was due on May 9. Comcast told me they do not credit accounts until the problem has been resolved. Today is May 11, 7 weeks since my services went down, and I have yet to hear from Comcast about the repair. I called Comcast again this afternoon to attempt to have my account credited because it is now 2 days overdue. After two calls I was finally able to speak to a supervisor named Donna, 
 ID#20782. After explaining my situation, she offered me a credit from March 24 – April 30 in the amount of $50.90. This is $33.96 less than my total bill, for a time period of more than a one month billing cycle. I told Donna I was going to file a complaint with the FCC, but she was unfazed. I feel helpless in this situation. Comcast is not providing the service they have promised, yet still expect me to pay for that service."
2170,"Please do not allow cable ISP companies to impose data caps. Bandwidth is not like oil, there is no limit or change of it running out. Only calbe companies not wanting to upgrade equipment. I pay for a higher speed to download, however if caps come in, i can reach my max cap in just 3 days watching netflix. They are trying to force me to buy their tv service which i do not need or want. I only have one choice for a decent ISP in my area. This is why comcast wants to start the cap so they can charge me for going over. If I could i would switch companies ASAP.

2171,"In July 2014, my comcast service suddenly went out. It was determined the cable line was improperly buried and a temporary line was run from the street to my house on top of the grass. This line was about 500 feet and ran into my neighbors yard. Over the last 8 1/2 months, I have been attempting to have comcast help with the re-install of the cable line from the street to my house. I have put in over 20 ""trouble tickets"" to have someone even clarify the situation and the progress. Sunday, the lawn mowing service, accidentally cut the line, which still presides on top of the grass. I called customer service and have spent a total of 3 1/2 hours on the phone with representatives to get a new temporary line run to my home from the street. They originally scheduled an appointment on the 22nd from 1pm-5pm and no one showed up. Again, I called back and got another appointment for the 23rd from 1pm -5pm and no one showed. I work from home and internet is essential to provide for my family. I have waited and waited for someone to care enough to give me a call, but no one has. I have taken 2 days off of work and waited for someone to assess the situation and it is not getting better. I have spoken with 2 supervisors in the last 24 hours and they keep sending me to the ""general"" scheduling line. Please Help! I am paying for a service I cannot use and to add insult to injury, I am paying for a mistake that was made when comcast originally installed the line to this home.

2175,"We just moved to Illinois and chose Comcast based on what was available in our area. We have had
 NOTHING but problems with them and no one is helping us or fixing the problem all they do is
 transfer us to to another department. First they had our order in under another name and was on the
 phone for over an hour while they had to totally redo our order. At the end of our conversation I was
 told I was able to go into their Xfinity office and pick up a self-install kit and was told I would have no
 problems. I drove 35 mins only to find out I was told the wrong info and that I was not able to get the
 X1 (Cable Box) in the store. They guy in the store told me I could either wait 5-10 business days to
 have them mailed me or he could totally take out my order and start a new order (For the second time
 now) and give me the cable boxes they had in the store and he would order the right boxes the next
 day at no charge. We went home and did the install while I was activating the equipment I was
 disconnected 3 times from a Comcast representative! Once we got the internet activated we did
 speed test on Xfinity and found out we were only get 5-10 mbps when we are paying to get 50 mbps.
 When I called customer service they told me the reason was that this was happening because I had
 new service and that by the next day it would be running at full speed and she would follow up that
 day and be giving us a credit for all the troubles we were having.(This was over 1 hour on the phone)
 That never happened and I waited a day and called costumer service yet again and was given the run
 around again and told they would be calling me back to get a service person out to our house and
 compisating us and it never happened again. (This was over an hour) I was told that I was not even
 getting charged for anything yet because our service was not working right but I received a bill of
 service and my mouth dropped to the floor and all the charges that I was not be be even charged for.
 $39.95 on site service Visit- NO ONE HAS BEEN OUT TO OUR PLACE
 $29.95 Dig Priority Shipping- I was told this was free
 I can not believe that a company this big is not taking care of my problem and no one is willing to help
 and everyone has a different answer and nothing gets fixed. I would think that when they hire new
 employees they would be trained in the same way and no have everyone different things.
 I have spent well over 6 hours of my time dealing with this problem and still do not have things fixed.
 Please help me on how I can contact corporate to get this handled right and get the service that we
 are paying for."
2176,"Called Comcast to schedule transfer of service, was told it would take 30 days and a new install would be required. On the scheduled day of the appointment between 8am-12pm nobody showed up, when we called Comcast to complain they said someone would be out by 2pm and would not credit our bill. Our next appointment time came and went and nobody showed up. Comcast said they will have to reschedule and we are still not being credited for lack of service for the past month and still be charged an installation fee on our next free.

2177,"My internet service promotion from Comcast expired May 2015 for the charge of $44.99. Three
 different sale persons called me and told me another promotion for $10 more to have Internet (same
 speed as the old promotion ) + HD TV service, else my Internet monthly fee alone will be raised to
 $74.99. After their third attempt, I said YES to them. A few weeks ago, I found out the monthly
 charge is actually $69.99 + $10 for HD TV service. I talked to them and the Comcast representative
 agreed to cut the $10 while admitted to me the monthly charge should be lowered to $59.99 since it
 was a mistake. (Even $59.99 was also not the charge I was quoted to in the 3 sales calls but I said
 yes to them). Today I got the bill and nothing has been changed and it is still $69.99 + $10. I talked to
 them again but no solution.
 I like to point out this is NOT the first time I have this experience with Comcast. It has been a hassle
 every time when they called me for upgrading service or promotion expired. Every time they touched
 my account, something went wrong or the bill went up etc.

I complained again and they sent a tech to my home who confirmed that I had no DVR.

2184,"Couple of items: March, after shutting off auto pay, they went into my account and took $311 without my authorization. Since March we have been lied too every time we make a payment which has to be in cash per their request until we have a $0 balance. We have a $0 balance and they originally said by end of June balance paid in full and July we would be able to pay by debit card. Both my daughter and I are on disability and are very upset emotionally. The only way we can pay, as they demanded, was to go to one of their payment centers and no where else. We have called more than 5 times a week and all we keep getting is transferred around and then hung up on. In my opinion they are not adhering to their customer service values and avoiding us because they know they were wrong in March. They are trying to cover up their mistakes. I need help in having this rectified ASAP as they illegally went into my checking account without my authorization. Please help.

2186,"I had used Comcast for my internet provider for roughly 5 years and was outside of the ""2 year contract"" when I attempted to terminate my service on May 20th, 2015 because I had switched to Verizon FiOS. They informed me that I would still be billed in full for the next two months. I explained that I was not okay with this, but they told me if I were moving to a new area that didn't have Comcast they wouldn't charge me, but since I had terminated the service willingly to switch to their competitor, the charges will remain. I asked to speak to a manager about this who was ""not available to take my call"". They asked if they could take my number down and have their manager call me back in 24-48 hours. I said yes, but I never received a call back. This seems like a clear tactic to dismiss me and hope that I go away and just continue to pay them for a service that I have canceled.

2187,"I am very unhappy with the data limits set by Comcast. Does an accurate measurement tool exist? I
 have been a customer of thiers for some time. According to the Comcast meter, in both Feb and
 March, I used less than 1 GB, April 70GB, now for May I am up to 302 GB. While on vacation, with no
 internet, I somehow reached 300. There is no way this should be legal."
2188,"I have Comcast cable internet for about 5 years. I had my own purchased modem that I started the
 service with and about 1.5 years ago Comcast took my own modem and replaced it with theirs due to
 internet issues. For last 6 months they are charging me rental fees on their modem and are not
 acknowledging that they took my equipment to replace this modem. At the time of modem
 replacement, I was told this will be my unit as they had taken my modem in it's place."

2190,"Extremely poor customer service. Customers are directed to Forums which are really complaint pages, literally hundreds of them, for answers to problems with connectivity. Many of the answers come from consumers, not IT professionals. It is incredibly hard to get answers over the phone if you have an issue, often you are routed and re-routed to several different people, none of whom are able to give answers or tell you there is no problem. I really wish someone from the FCC would just go to the help and support pages of Comcast and LOOK at what people are saying. This company is one of the largest around and people are being treated with disrespect or ignored completely. Someone needs to hold them accountable to the public that pays their wages.

2191,"This is more of a general complaint. We are attempting to downgrade our Comcast services. Last fall, we had two services (internet + phone) at (we thought) the outrageous price of roughly $90/month. We added cable (yay college sports!). Now, outrageous fees of just under $160/month. College basketball is over. Attempting to remove cable, and Comcast says unbundled services (we cannot go back to a 2-bundle from a 3-bundle without leaving entirely for a lengthy time) will cost roughly $120/month. We can get a special deal for three services at $99/month (plus modem rental, plus fees and taxes, so let's say $115/month). I feel like I am being taken advantage of. Comcast is pretty much the only high-speed, high-quality internet connection in my neighborhood, and they know it. I would like to strongly suggest that you NOT o.k. any mergers with Time Warner, and also that you support any and all other operators that would like to compete with Comcast.

2193,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on it's own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has not reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

2195,"In 2011 we signed a service agreement with Xfinity Comcast. This agreement is digitally signed via
 docusign. Each year Xfinity raised our rate without our consent, each year we have had to fight them
 with this contract. This year, they practically doubled our rate and continue to bully us into accepting.
 We have requested they cancel our service and we wish to take legal action against Comcast for
 breach of contract. Comcast however will not respond to our phone calls, email, or in person
 requests to either honor this contract, disconnect our service, or refund charges we did not agree to in
 our digitally signed contact. Xfinity will turn out account over to collection and our credit will be
 negatively impacted despite the fact we have asked for our service to be disconnected for the more
 than two months now. At Xfinity it is impossible to reach a real person via phone or chat, in person
 the reps are not willing to help, I have sent several emails to management which have been ignored.
 Our bill account continues to be overcharged (again despite our digitally signed service agreement).
 THis is corporate bullying at its best. Request the FCC assist us. Thank you very much for your
 help. Attached is our digitally signed contract and a copy of our recent bill which includes
 unauthorized price increases and charges for services not agreed to in our contract."
2196,"I have tv internet and phone with Comcast. Last week my internet and phone went out. I tried to reset the modem a few time didn't work. I call Comcast they do the same thing I just did trying to reset the Modem. Didn't work so the lady on the phone apparently only handled telephone issues and said she would have to send it to someone else and that can take 42-78 hours. I am like okay well I still need my internet working. She was like oh well someone else has to do that. So she put in a request for someone to come out Friday (this was Wednesday). The person who came was really nice and helpful and he replaced the modem and called for someone to come out and do some work outside. That guy wasn't as friendly and was disconnecting and reconnecting my phone and internet almost all day. Mind you I was trying to work from home that day. He knocked on the door and was like its fix. So the weekend went by fine no issues and Monday I come and again it's not working. I tried for over an hour calling Comcast and you have to answer 50 million questions and the system still would not give me a representative. Then it kept trying once again to reset my modem and when that did work it told me to call back and disconnected me. When I was supposed to be transferred to a person it disconnected me. I am so mad with this company. When I finally get someone on the phone I told her before anything what my issues were and she verifies all this information then says oh I can't help you I only deal with TV issues. Then why in the world did you just have me verify my life history. I asked to be transferred oh she couldn't transfer me because something was wrong with her system. NO surprise. Comcast is charging me $200 a month for services that are not worth it. My tv freezes up this morning I couldn't even turn the box off with and without the remote. I have no phone and I have a 13 year old daughter that if my alarm goes off ADT can't call because the phone isn't work. I need to work from home and I have no internet. Then when I called about how my bill shot up all they can give me is $20 off. This is crazy all this money I am paying for something that isn't working. I should get a refund not only for this inconvenience but for the time I have to take off work to deal with Comcast. I don't like the fact that when I called back again and had to cuss out the audio system to finally get someone they blaming me that its something wrong on my end. I have been in this house for 5 years and everything was working not great but working and now I have no service but the TV. There should be another cable company available in our area so we wont be forced to use Comcast and then have to deal with the poor customer service and the blaming everything on the customer. So now today June 2nd I have to leave work early keep in mind I work in Washington DC and I live in Virginia so I have to pay extra to get home and be there for yet another Comcast appointment. this is the 3rd time someone has come out in less then a week and still can't this issues resolved. I am so frustrated and the fact that bill is $200 and this is what I have to deal with. I don't even have anything fancy and the bill is that much. This is a racket and I don't know why they are allowed to keep doing this to people.

It's incredibly frustrating trying to hunt for jobs online, or even just browse the web. They have sent out technicians twice, and they have not fixed a thing.

2198,"I setup a Comcast internet service for my home in May 2013 when I moved into a new home. I had a basic Internet service via cable and did not have cable TV or phone because I did not want nor need these services. My service was ~$40/month. One day Comcast called and talked to me wife and tricked her into signing up for some increased speed internet service which they told her was FREE, however it was not. My bill increased. My wife was not an authorized person the account so when she called back to try and correct the problem they said she could not since she wasn't on the account, so I had to call in to correct the problem. It's odd that she could somehow authorize a change in the account that would cost more money, but not be able to reserve that. After almost a year of back and forth with Comcast, my bill still isn't back to the basic $40/month internet service. I was more recently told they would put me on a $40/month plan with free basic cable and HBO. I reluctantly accepted as it was the only way to get somewhat back to my $40 internet. I clarified with Comcast that is was $40 flat with NO extra fees and they concurred. I got my first bill and there was no change in the higher bill even though I had moved over to a new plan. I was told it was because I didn't activate a cable box they had shipped to me that I didn't want. I tried to activate and was unsuccessful. They sent out a tech who gave me a new cable box and said the one I had was too old. I was told the charges would be reversed. On the next bill I received a charge for the service tech, which I was told would be free, and a $10 charge for a cable box which they also said was FREE. I got onto an online chat with Comcast and was told I was being charged $10 because I had an HD box. I was told the charges would be reversed if I went down to the Comcast store and exchanged my HD box for a standard box. I recently got another bill and have found that NONE of the previous charges had been removed, and I'm still being charged $10/month for the cable box. I would drop Comcast in a heartbeat if I had another internet option, but I do not. There is a DSL company in my area but they tell me there are no more sockets and they can not provide me with any service at this time. So I am stuck with Comcast. I would like the FCC to pursue an investigation into Comcasts cramming practices, and shady billing practices. I have kept all of my online chat sessions recorded in email, and I have documented each call as well. Thank you for your time and assistance.

2199,"Last week I found out that Comcast has been charging me for the cost of router rental, when iin fact, I have owned my own router and not rented from them for the last 2 years. I called them and asked them to refund these overcharges, and they informed me that they would only refund the last three months. When I protested, I was placed on hold, transferred several times, and finally put through to the ""customer loyalty"" division where a man said he was not authorized to go back more than three months, but he would have someone call me back the next day (Friday). I got no call. Today (Tuesday), I got a cheery call from a woman who was following up to make sure my complaint had been resolved! When I emphatically stated that it had not, she transferred me to another woman. This person reiterated that she could only go back three months to refund the overcharges. I told her that Comcast had taken money they were not supposed to have, and that arbitrarily deciding that they would only refund three months of this stolen money to me was not acceptable. She then put me on hold and after nearly 5 minutes, I was disconnected.

I experience multiple outages per day, most lasting between 10 and 30 minutes. There are some days where I do not experience a single outage. I have worked with Comcast's customer support and have had technicians on site on multiple occasions. On each occasion, the problem clears up for 1-3 weeks and then returns. On the last technician visit, I was charged for installing two additional outlets without my authorization or knowledge, then I had to call to get a refund of that charge after I explained to them that they technician was there to repair my service. I have since contacted their corporate offices in order to obtain better customer service. They were kind enough to give me a free month of service. I have spent 11 hours of my time away from work or being unable to work due to no internet connection (I work from my apartment). The free month of service has compensated me for approximately 3 hours of that time. However, the problem persists and now I can't even get a response from their corporate customer service department.

2205,"I was given a $7.00 credit by Comcast on a bill in April 2015. After more observation, it appeared they realized they had been overcharging me for an extra modem. I researched back further than April and discovered they had been overcharging me since June of 2013! Sure it was only a few dollars/month but it added up to $191.00 in overcharges.
 When I called to ask them to refund my money, I was told by a rep via phone that they could only refund back TWO MONTHS. I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24 hours. (LIE #1)
 When 24 hours came and went, I called again. I again asked to talk to a supervisor and told the rep, I had heard that line before and would not wait another 24 hours. A ""supervisor"" then told me I needed to go to a Comcast Xfinity store if I wanted to resolve my issue beyond the 2 month time frame they would reimburse me. When I went to the store, the rep took all my information (I had physical bills) but made ME contact the customer billing dept from their phone to confirm I had been receiving double charges since June 2013)
 I did that and she completed a ""request for a refund"" on line, as she reported. She asked me if I wanted a credit and I told her ""no"" as I really wasn't even sure I wanted to keep the service.
 She promised to call me within a few days to see if someone from Comcast contacted me. (LIE #2).
 The rep also gave me an email to contact her but it did not go through (LIE #3). I waited TWO WEEKS and when no one from Comcast contacted me, I went back to the Comcast store and asked for the rep who filed my report. I was told she was off but another rep took a look at the report and told me the first rep filed it incorrectly and that HE would change it to the correct form and call me the following Tuesday (the day I saw him was Friday) to le tme know what transpired. Of course Tuesday came and went and no one called (LIE #4) SO...
 I went back to the store TWO WEEKS LATER and asked to talk to the Supervision of the Comcast/Xfinity story but was told he was ""in the back, busy"". I then saw my first rep, who indicated she remembered me, appeared shocked I hadn't been able to resolve the problem and when I told her the 2nd rep said she filed the report wrong, she looked into it on her computer and said she had just reported it on the wrong form, but would resubmit it (Lie #5) I asked to talked to the Supervisor again and was told he was ""not in"". When I told her just moments before I was told he was ""in the back working"", she began entering something into her computer and said her supervisor was ""working on it."" (LIE #6).
 I kept insisting he come out and see me personally and I think because there were others in the store, and I continued to become more insistent, all of the sudden a man emerged dressed in jeans and a graphic T shirt telling me he was the manager and explaining he needed ""PROOF"" from me to convince billing.(Lie #7).
 I had ALL my bills and he looked at one, took it in the back and said, he was going to talk to the financial dept. I wanted to know WHY HE NEEDED PROOF FROM ME anyway for billing since billing HAS ALL THE ACCESS to charges, but he could not explain that (LIE #8)
 He actually gave me his phone number and told me he would contact me in a few days to see if everything had gone through. (Lie #9).
 I also told him I did not want a credit but expected a refund and he said he understood and would contact me later that night by the time the store closed. ( Lie #10)
 The first rep did actually contact me the next day and say they were still ""working on it""(Lie #11)
 Several days later when I hadn't heard from anyone I called the supervisors number and left a message. He did not call me back. I did call again the next day and he answered and said, ""Oh I thought it was all fixed and your bill got credited."" I reminded him I did not want a credit but expected a refund. He said, ""okay let me take care of it"" and hung up. I immediately checked my account and did not see any credit, however I checked again and the next day saw a credit for $26!
 I called the billing dept to ask what the credit was for and they said, ""you were overcharged for something and we credited it"" When I noted the credit did not add up correct for a 2 month refund, the rep said, ""Yeah, there is something wrong but anyway you got a credit!""
 SO...COMCAST has credited me approximately $33 on a $191 bill and would now like to call it even. JUST IMAGINE ANY OTHER BUSINESS being allowed to get away with overcharging a customer for nearly 2 years and then thinking they should be happy to get it resolved for pennies on the dollar. WHO gets away with this ? It's not even all about the money. It's about the way they do business that no one ever calls them on. THEY ARE TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE and should have a class action suit launched against them by all consumers who have been overcharged and not successful in being able to resolve the issue with them. There would be THOUSANDS of customers involved. Just take a look at all the complaints.
 COMCAST IS EVIL, DECEITFUL and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have known in my life. No wonder everyone hates to do business with them.
 Nearly everyday I get a postcard or letter in the mail telling me I should try their fastest internet. I am saving ALL of them and will be sending them all back in a very big envelope!
 Here's the best part. COMCAST is in the communication business and yet the phone number on my bill to contact in case of any problems was a disconnected number AND there is no phone you can call at any COMCAST XFINITY store!!
 On Comcast's own forum, the complaints against consistent overcharges and not being able to resolve these kind of complaints with Comcast are overwhelming. http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?page=72&q=overcharges&search_type=thread&filter=labels
 And it appears this has been allowed to go on for YEARS and YEARS. Why is everyone so afraid to approach Comcast and make them make good with their customers?
 FCC, Isn't THIS your job to address all the countless complaints customers have with this wreck less giant who has gotten away with bilking the public hundreds of thousands of dollars for years with no end in sight.
 I have a copy of EVERY BILL where I was overcharged but I cannot get Comcast to take any responsibility other than the $26 credit that wasn't even correct.
 Doesn't someone need to start auditing Comcast closer? PLEASE HELP!!
 Best Regards,

2207,"Is it too much to ask to know what my bill will be from month to month? i don't change my service monthly, and i don't buy movies...so why can't i be told that my bill will be $X, which include whatever stupid fees that they are charging (it would be nice to know EXACTLY what those fees mean, as well), on top of the base rate, plus whatever taxes (also, it's a service, not a good, so why am i being charged?).
 Comcast plays games with billing on a regular basis and then they get offended when you call to complain.
 my last bill was over $200. i called and they said it was a clerical error. but this isn't the first time they have had an 'oops' moment. it happens a few times a year.
 i don't have a choice about my provider - what happened to NO MONOPOLY? did i miss a memo that said we're back in the 1800s and it's like 'one ring to rule them all' again?

2215,"Comcast has not been giving me good Internet service. Quality of service is poor and their resolution
 timeline is also poor.
 I pay them approximately $85 a month.
 Six months ago, the connection kept dropping every few hours, then the frequency of dropped
 connections kept getting worse. Long story short, it took them a month to determine, that they had
 turned the power too high on the pole for the connection and that made the cable modem reboot. And
 they would not accept my diagnostics that the power was high. First they said that my cable modem
 has gone bad, I bought a new cable modem and the problem persisted. Only after the service
 technician came in did the matter get resolved, after a month of terrible service.
 On May 27th 2015, at about 3 PM EST, my service went down again. I contacted Comcast and their
 customer service went through the perfunctory politeness and transferred me to another service rep.
 She gave me the wrong information that there was a widespread outage and tried to keep selling me
 new services even after repeatedly telling her that I do not want to change my services. I had to call
 them again that this was not a widespread outage and they need to send a technician. Then I am
 told that they cannot send me a technician until Friday, that is almost 48 hours late.
 I telecommute and need to be home with my parents. Not only do I have to now drive to work but I
 cannot be with my parents who are not in the best of health. My home phone is a VOIP phone and
 my parents do not have a cellphone, in the event of an emergency, they have no recourse to contact
 me or emergency services.
 This level of service is deplorable. Within a span of six months, I have had two major problems with
 my service and Comcast has shown little willingness to help me proactively and prevent future
 problems. All they do is issue a credit for the time of outage. But what about my lost productivity and
 the risk to me? Comcast is the only choice I have for fast Internet and they act like an absolute
 monopoly when one looks at their service quality."
2216,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/24/2015 9:41:32 AM:
 I failed to mention one other issue I have had with Comcast and their billing. When my wife and I moved to our residence 3 years ago, we moved our Comcast internet service from the home we were previously renting to the home we had just purchased. Comcast will provide you with a modem for their internet service and charge you $7/month to ""rent it."" To bypass this fee I chose to purchase my own modem, and we were using it at our previous residence. I informed the tech installing my service that I had my own modem. I didn't check my bill to see if I was being charged for a modem I wasn't using until over a year later. I realized my bill seemed a lot higher than what I was originally quoted and realized they had been billing me the $7 fee for a modem rental when I was using my own
 device. Billing history proved they had been billing me for over 18 months for a modem I didn't have. I called to complain and was immediately refunded $21 (or 3 months worth of fees). I was told that a member of management had to approve the refund of the other 13 months ($91) of fees and that I would hear from a Comcast representative within 10 business days. That time came and went. After calling back into Comcast I was told by a different rep that that the 3 months was all they would refund and it was my responsibility to ensure my bill was correct.
 How is this an acceptable business practice? I made sure to inform the only Comcast representative I encountered when my service was connected to my home that I had my own device. He did not install one of the Comcast devices when he was on site. I am sure that paperwork had to be filed in some way to prove he was at my home. A call had to be made to turn on the service and ensure my modem could be seen on their network. If you speak to Comcast today any tech will tell you that it states ""Customer has own modem"" all over our account as we have complained to them several times about this issue. How hard is it to refund $91 to a customer that YOU mistakenly billed and it was not the fault of the customer?
 Again, I would use a different vendor for my services, but there are no other options for me.

2220,"I am a deaf guy. I have asked ATT or Comcast to see if they will provide cable or DSL service in my area. The reason is: Broadband makes it possible for people to see each other. They may sign to each other or get visual cues to understand communication, such as through speech reading. They may also use broadband to connect to sign language interpreters. Dial-up connections simply are too slow for such uses. Because broadband is always on, it functions much like a telephone. The “ring” of the phone becomes a message that pops up on the computer screen or other device, such as a videophone. Broadband can be a source of reasonable accommodations for deaf and hearing employees, through the provision of text, e-mail, instant messaging, video communication, and relay service access. The broadband is important for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
 My physical address is 3.5 miles away from the service box . The service box is located on ""Happyville Road"" which it means that doesn't have enough cable to furnish a service to my house.

2223,"A few months ago I was forced to finally call Comcast about their extremely slow and poor internet speeds - our internet has never been fast, disappointing given the fact that I pay 150 dollars per month for it. It was cutting out and dropping every 15-20 minutes of use. I was outsourced to a 'tech' whom of which was not helpful in the slightest, he told me that the issue was on my end and that we would need to get a new modem. Okay, fine, so the next day I go to the nearest Comcast center to obtain a new modem. The employee there tells me to just 'plug and play' - no instructions, no signing anything, nothing at all. I go to work later that day, when I get home, to no surprise the connection isn't working. I once again call customer support - where after 25 minutes of rhetoric, the tech tells me that I will have to have a tech visit to see what the issue is. He tells me that the visit will be 40 dollars. I tell him that I'm not paying anything, I pay enough, the service is awful as it - and this is clearly a hardware issue or something on there end. He says fine. When the tech comes to complete the order, he tells me that they didn't activate it when they gave it to me - so it was the Comcast centers fault that it wasn't working, and that there was nothing I could do to make it run without sending a tech. Come bill time - not only was the tech visit billed to me, but I was also billed for shipping and handling, despite the fact THAT I PICKED IT UP MYSELF, ZERO SHIPPING. I had to argue with three different 'supervisors' about getting these false and unruly 'fees' off my bill, needless to say they were extremely dubious about doing so. A week after I received the first draft of the bill - we noticed they didn't take off anything except the shipping and handling fees. So I had to call again and talk to another supervisor. This one offered me HBO for a month or whatever and I just told them no, I want my speeds to be up to what I pay for; that I want to stop being throttled and to take the fees off my bill as I am not paying them. About two weeks later the problem still isn't solved, I still have tech fees on my bill. They said that I have to wait for some other supervisor to contact me at a later date about the dispute. Hours before the bill deadline (trying to hit me with a late fee.) I'm finally contacted by a supervisor. I told them no and to stop filibustering, I have been waiting for days for a supervisor to contact me and take these things off my bill. After a long talk with the 3rd supervisor he finally caves and takes the fees off. My service since then has been just as bad, if not worse; the speeds are low, it cuts outs daily, we have to reset it all the time. I've tested the speeds, showing much lower rates than what I am paying for - and even this month there are mysterious fees that I have no idea what they are or where they came from. I have to once again, call them tomorrow about my bill, which has no reason to be changed from my end.

 I haven’t been able to sign into my account or to make an account. Every time I try to create a password, the ’submit’ button is inactive and does not work. I would like to be kept up to date as to what the status of my issue is. Thank you.
